It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Anyway, I didn't do it to you.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promises to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
It's gonna take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm walking around.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom isn't helping me enough.
I'm not using Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
We were out of water.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom is not my father.
Tom is my neighbor.
Tom is already gone.
He's probably still got it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The sewer was closed.
Breakfast is from 7:00 to 9:00.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've been watching.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he knows nothing about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
It's mine, give it back.
Wolves were eating the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the fee?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I really like that tattoo.
He bought a card for nothing.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're my lot, I can recognize you.
I'll give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have you been doing so far?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
- How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did Tom ask why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father and is trying to redeem himself.
Tom can't fake himself.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love the honey.
I have to admit something.
Alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom is a little broken in the images.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have answered no.
I owe him a helping hand.
He's being criticized.
You'll know when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit the butter.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be so mean to me.
I think you did it.
We're not made of monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It was all night long.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too big a brat for me.
I'll do that, if you don't mind.
Tom is right.
You're a little rough.
Sounds like Tom.
No one judges you.
Stop making Tom angry.
What could go wrong?
When will I get to Boston?
Tom ate breakfast later.
Are you helping?
Are you two related?
He wants ham and eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom is obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat. I know.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give his best?
Mary's been working on the movie.
She has a beautiful manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote the report himself.
Is this what they buy?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
It was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London now.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at it.
We better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do you really think we should have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you turn it around?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're in luck.
My nose runs out every time I'm cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you can understand.
Everyone is looking for luck.
Has anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom was terrible with me in high school.
Tom wore a cap that was still priced.
Tom promises to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is damned.
We need to call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're murderers.
Don't pretend to be a man with a crush.
She tried herself.
Get out of here!
Is there a delivery charge?
I like the tail.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one of these, have you?
You'll never hit.
I think I'm going to be okay.
Mosquitoes are transmitting malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't know.
That's too bad.
Let me tell you something else.
What's the matter with you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
Receipts and checks.
Spring is a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You hit one.
The Macedonian language has four verbs: expressive, conditional, commanded, and superficial.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom isn't very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are accurate.
I don't have a gun.
I need a permit.
We are the champions.
She scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember meeting the Queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How could you not sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a seal.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our gate is big.
It's a child's play.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll be back at 6:30.
Tom took me to motherfucking house.
I only had an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Does Tom think that's what happened?
The show must go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention to yourself.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or bull?
We're running out of gas.
Tom is a trailblazer.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him?
The girl saw that.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary flowers?
What's not to like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want any ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Be careful not to get stuck in the alley bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through the tunnel.
Tom is too sensitive.
Mary washed our dishes.
We weren't expecting them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want to play tennis?
It's going to be okay.
The sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day of the scourge they're trying to escape.
They're all crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to find her.
It's completely wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future starts today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't being whispered into.
Maybe Tom is playing chess with Mary right now.
You seem right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's room is a mess.
There are no survivors.
She should have left.
I'm not like you!
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees". "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I'll never forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I got his beef.
Tom is not alone.
Tom needs to get cleaned up.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll finish the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will make you happy.
The king was particularly troubled to hold speeches, because of his difficulty in speaking.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is a struggle.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.

Your doctorate must be written in English.

It's getting closer.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
It is worth quoting a well-known passenger from his essay.
Tom wishes Mary luck.
Tom is uncaring.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by assassins.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get to it right away.
Didn't you hear me screaming?
Hey, take a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back.
Get the stick out.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom came forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
So you didn't want the prize?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're pleased.
They're not being honest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to value your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
- Get your hands together.
Get him to admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short dresses.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
But, Albert, your theory is wrong.
We went bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if I need you.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the lights.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not a shred of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded.
We've been discussing this.
Tom grabs the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let me get a call.
Electric heater heats the pottery tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll give it back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the cradles.
Let's just forget about it.
Because of his father's sudden death, he abandoned his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
- Hey, ladies, what's up?
I'll summarize the whole thing up.
I don't know.
I couldn't take it at first.
His glove is hanging.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
- Shut up! - Shut up!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are blocked.
I offended you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die, you know.
They were chatting next to him.
Tom is not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The reporting deadline is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty late.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I've thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's going to help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came down to my knees.
Let's make some cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to release Tom.
Shame on you!
Don't get too excited.
Sylvia loved the shows.
Invite them to join us.
Where should I park?
Does anyone care?
How can you be guilty of that?
Tom drinks beer from a bottle of wine.
I fell off my bike.
Get in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
- You mind?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are splitting.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate money.
I've got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But I'm lying to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very well today!
Tom did not approve of the plan.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did he ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's your call, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom ran through the barn.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Sanfo is really thirsty.

I auditioned a few times, but I didn't get a job.
That was almost 30 years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Can Tom swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom is my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
- Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to go.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They've blocked him.
Tom is getting tired.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You need to stay away from him as much as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
Didn't you know Tom was a fag?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says his previous bar told him he'd remove his nicotine patches if he quit.
Don't expect everyone to share your views.
That's what Tom suggested.
It seems a little wrong.
Tom is a smart guy.
Carrot in flour is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a painful night.
Tom was driving around town on a sledgehammer without noticing.
Yeah, well, at least.
You want to camp?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You have now, don't you?
I'm pretty bloated.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher is probably turning into a grave now.
People often complain about injustice, not realizing that their own conduct is bad.
He's wearing high heels to make himself taller.

I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right, I'm right.
I've been robbed three times a month.
Can I come with you?
You need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't get your shit together.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me a piece of shit.
What's that got to do with it?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
She gave up on the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're such a different person.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom has made up his mind.
Tom won't be very hands-on.
It was such a beautiful day, we decided to go mountaineering.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
Your coffee is getting energy!
Tom was a fine man.
It's a big miracle for football.

Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're going to miss you, Tom.
Tom works for NASA.
Tom writes well.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to dismiss the idea.
Tom is really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose lineup is this?
- Stay away from her.
His eyes glittered with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to pitch a tent.
That was so nice.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
You're gonna have to ask him about that.
He made a promise.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
I want to travel.
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's get on with it.
That's what Tom wanted to meet me with.
You should ask them for help.
I'm never going to tell you.
Tom may be richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was all this about?
I don't have that desire.
I've been calling a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your sauce.
- He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicide.
The hard-winged, butterfly, and the bird are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's start a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom cut his knee.
Where did the pineapples come from?
Can I talk to you upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I look at the menu?
He's smart. He's got a lot of heart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't succeed.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soda. I'm not going to drink soda.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize a guy.
Help me out here, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her in.
You're cooking a little buttermilk with candles.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going to go what he wants.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking too much.
I know what that sounds like.
Tom apparently didn't mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling a lot better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm really hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a shame the concrete isn't burning.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped suddenly.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
What a bug you are.
Put the bottle down.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm pissed off.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always been a little bit of a jack of all trades.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
Not one part of the pigs fell.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What's next?
Put him in a mental hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom is packing his bags.
What's the use of that?
That's very helpful.
Tom's phone was vibrating.
I decided to buy a new chard.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
- Remember what I did last night?
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Your judgments save you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
It didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be such a fool.
I can't open the tow.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your lunch.
That's not a priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
- You got it? - Yeah.
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom is skating on the ice.
I will never surrender.
I hope you're ready to challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first bird I've seen this spring.
You want to play?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
You think I know what's going on?
Tom seems to be having fun.
Tom is not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch your step!
Linda had a seizure and suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front door.
The meeting started more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel a little sick.
I'll do what I know and do.
I got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom has made amends.
Tom threw the arrow.
It's not cockroaches.
It's not safe for me here.
Unfortunately, Mary came to the party in a blonde dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's helpful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of mammoth is the emotional mammoth.
Let's get some fun.
The bees remove the honey to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget that.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary came into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he actually is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This is not blue, this is purple.
Who was he with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they turn one year old, so they are eaten by humans.
Could you pull the arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He's wasting his money, wasting his water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not really sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
- Come on, you know what?
It weighs.
Why should we find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom keeps lying to me.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very bad at silencing sounds.
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We'll be all right.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you hitting me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels protect and guide us.

Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom is sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been a great protector of his children.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen cloths.
I'm safe here.
Your eyes look strange.

How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
It's coming down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Oh, my God, look at this.
You know, sometimes you should listen to him.
- You know how to piss?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'm going to use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
- Give me the meetings.

Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
We're having Italian black peppers this afternoon.

It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.

This is not a joke.
None of that matters.

They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for it myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French spell their word for "boubamar"
The lift can lift 20 tons of concrete.
You are beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
You good at that?
We're pretty good at this.

Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom apparently was trying to convince Mary to take action.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of you.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom is here.

No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You're in a bad mood, aren't you?

I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.

Take the little one, your nose is running.

Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to believe me.
I just don't want you to do anything you'll regret.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom rarely goes out.
We set up a tent.
I thought it wouldn't rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish he'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very pretty, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing his pajamas and a bathing suit when I came in with a sable.
We've all read that.

If you come out naked like that, you'll catch cold.
Is it still hurting?
It was pretty funny.
I set up a guest.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say something?

What's the shortcut?
Thanks again for coming.

I'll do that anyway.

We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to his prophets.

We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You are so talented.
I have to fix this.
- Where are you going? - I'm going.

I hate it when you guys fight.
I should have been cultured.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.

He's in a lot of debt.
She knows the major capitals.
What's under the blanket?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's got everybody drinking.
- Are you ready to go? - Yeah.
Tom is obviously crazy.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her leash.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First, I have something I want to show you.
What are they afraid of?
I'm carrying my passport.
It was a craft they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pencil.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk without a trace.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
I'm in pain at work.
The question is who's going to do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, all right?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's making me nervous.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was totally wrong.
Please ask me what it was.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not ashamed of it.
Tom is under medical supervision.
Ask Tom where he is.
- How do you look? - I'm fine.
Tom is a wonder child.
That pedestrian goes to school.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't see why you wouldn't help.
Tom seems very imaginative.
Now the question is what we should do.
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
Don't get your shit together.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lived across the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.

I'm weak.
- What? - A wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.

Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
Animals are at risk.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom is ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't respond right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were outrageous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating that.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make up for it.
Is the house ready?
Tom's vices are urban, and they get even better after he drinks a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You're not good at business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yes, it will be all right... when the fish has grapes.
Tom is a counselor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You insulted me by calling me an ass.
Since when is there a fire?
Tom may be lonely.
I don't hate people; I never let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.
I didn't give up anything.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question that no one, including myself, has ever answered, despite 30 years of research into the female soul, is, "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
The peasants are harvesting.
Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom is not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did he ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What was the subject?
With each split, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it through your head?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom seems ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can scan images too.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
They all stood up.
Money is not the criterion of success.
I want to know when it's your birthday.
What are you guys talking about?
Keep me happy!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not going to move.
- Wait a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's enough air in here.
She married for a man.
The wind is still.
There's nothing like the shift.
You don't have to wear anything.
The old man was brought up before he died.
I don't own the book.
I was lucky to get it.
What would Tom want that for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I got some locusts.
Can someone help me?
We'll leave this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone else to do that.
I have to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you Google it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom took him to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm doing.
Are you sure we shouldn't be getting laid first?
He who can hear butterflies laughing knows what clouds taste like.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will surrender.
Just find them.
I can't get through to them.
They pulled a trigger to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not for you to smell like merchandise!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be much more scared.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
You forgot that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my work.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I'm sick of the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is to our right.
Tom is not an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want to get back to my old life.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
The guy's a bandit.
Tom may have seen it.
Tom is a bit of a dog.
Tom is very immature.
What are you doing?
How do you find the volume on a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom isn't drunk, but he's been drinking.
I'm pleased with your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a revenge.
Tom is stabbing a fork in the stake.
Am I going to be replaced?
I need to get some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a species of mammals.
Dan seduced Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
Did you like his music?
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he doesn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's about to come back.
This will make our job much easier.
I think that's awful.
What's in the office?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave?
He took over the business.
You don't want fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He has wine.
His feelings were not reversed.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, just tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
- Get your hands off me.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm good at that.
Does it hurt so much?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the weather.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
It was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom may say something we don't want to hear.
Every people has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's going to get cold.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were torn.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom is drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom is untouchable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the fair.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom mad at you?
This is my latest round.
I haven't been feeling well in two days.
Blood is waste, it's too good a trick.
We don't think that.
I think Tom is rich.
I must have been surprised.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a donkey and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The rainfall is not in sight.
I'll tell them to leave right now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got a real one.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
- Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was banging Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of this makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't give up.
I like to watch lesbian pornos.
Who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
- Shut up, please.
Tom immediately worried.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already believe.
He writes a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was pretending to be surprised.
The boy couldn't swim across the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
Try it.
The old maid has a certain charm.
This is a taboo subject.
We barely made it.
Did they hire you?
It's running out of liquid.
Tom could see Mary sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little shocked.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and beat her up - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the rug.
Let's vote for him.
Tom is sitting.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
- Shall I continue?
He was smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not happening here.
It's better to be optimistic and lie than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the semaphore to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into several waterproof sections.
Given what you've been cooking, I'll wash dishes.
Let's just leave it at that.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
There are false eyelashes.
I'm not gonna wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
- You hear a throb?
I'm not waiting for them.
You don't have to be scared.
Are you mad at me?
He's not that shy boy anymore.
- What?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys everywhere, divided into groups, some playing dice, some playing tiles, some playing with balls, some riding bicycles or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed in.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that love causes is the lesser of all pleasures.
Nice of you to get Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's get this way.
I just handed it over.
Let's stay married.
We have to find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He's got his head in the air.
We're out of here.
Get the seat back.
What's the point?
What is Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom is angry.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad at you.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat fermented food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
You're not gonna do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't tell which one the baby wants, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to drive home.
This is real love.
Can you look at me?
He's rich, but he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old roof in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a fake lead.
Tom was fighting.
I said maybe he'll come back.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
Tom was.
I'm not judging you.
Somebody is singing.
You know how to fix things?
- You go.
I forgot his address.
Are you handcuffed?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her luck has a slit on one side.
Let's have a little late.
I'll be out in a minute.
What's your analysis?
Tom is too busy to help.
I'm doing a good job.
She can't read or write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Get in the car.
Tom and I had an agreement.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I think Tom is not breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom will be out of prison at some point.
The most expensive thing is land.
Tom said he wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom is a popular guy.
Did he use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We ran out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you fighting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does that cost?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Do you get up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
Which state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I just walked into my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean. I got it.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard that.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, no, not at all.
There's no one.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He gave his best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom is a runner.
Tom is not listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them right away.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are very different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the deal?
Is that necessary?
Tom stayed.
I'll never miss you.
He made it look easy.
You'd better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it'd be best if you called them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German crowns.
We were 18 at the time.
I make 13 bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate carnival.
I get discouraged when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Keep it up.
This is disgusting.
Tom is really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I told you I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
You got drunk.
Tom started to complain.
I think you should choose her.
- You're being nice.
You are so lovely.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We've got to leave you.
Light the candles and imagine your wish.
Come on, open it up.
Tom looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a doxer.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
- Are you ready? - Yes.
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary doesn't wash the dishes.
Tom is a joker.
I was much worse.
Tom helped himself to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be thin.
This is Tom, my assistant.
- Are you there yet?
I only had one glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom told his mother not to speak with his mouth full.
They're all out of control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm only calling you as soon as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right with you.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who is Dan talking to?
They've been rounding us up.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom isn't very tough.
It was after midnight.
That is outrageous.
What happens if you get wet?
- Did you change the shampoo?
Tom looked around, desperately expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a great pessimist.
You're entitled to one phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home now.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'm gonna tell you a secret that's gonna change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I don't want to lose myself.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'm going to stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't think it's a party, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom is soaking his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard it like a squeeze.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on the ridge.
I'll take anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What's your favorite French wine?
It's Christmas soon.
You should feel comfortable.
Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate formulation of the question.
Tom was apparently used to these problems.
You'll be all right.
It was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I made coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom is upset.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the winners are always right, and the losers are the culprits.
Tom and Mary's dolls.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if at all it can be said to be possible.
It was an arena day.
I have some bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome your weakness.
How many glasses do you make a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you have a key?
Let's be realistic about this.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom has no job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came to me, his whole body was full of alcohol.
Tom is losing his mind.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little stake.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
I'm not coming for you, Tom.
Take first place in the contest.
I just want you back.
Dan was smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed up late yesterday.
You're a piece of shit.
All the boots.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
He's given up on the plan.
It's not just a rush.
How are we gonna find them?
Maybe it seems weird.
No one can escape death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Do you own this?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.

Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a card to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that all we need?
He was desperate for health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has ear pain.
Dan hit him in the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not the time.
You're out of booze.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do this.
Tom became famous.
I'm stuck with a song in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's Tom up to?
A mother's advice would outweigh a friend's.
We're not out of danger yet.
Tom is angry.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a deer.
Dan's calling the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.

This is hard for her.
Mary put on a carmine.
She has a picture.
They all swim.
The flowers are blooming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very upsetting.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, now!
We are sorry.
Maybe Tom will be scared and give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
I wouldn't want to bother you.
No one wants to sit with you?
It would be nice to keep quiet.
Tom decided that Mary was having a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do that.

She's complicated.
Check if the current is off.
Would you be a part of this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the pot.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I like coffee more than tea.
I didn't rush.
Mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you get a message to Tom?
He flirtes so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom lit the curtain, just by accident.
Did you talk to Tom?
It's hard to understand self-harm if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This will hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure is increasing.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom has been driving that car for three years.
Can the mortar be used in food?

Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.
Tom is the leader.
Save Tom.
You don't have a problem solved, do you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I don't like talking about them.
We're busy right now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've read it before.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom got very angry.
What kind of situations would you use it for?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you're going to have to do this without help.
We're all at risk.
Tom won't like him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom is excited.
Take Tom's gun from him.
Look back at you.

I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you play any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
She's afraid she might get lung cancer.
You've been studying me a lot.
Tom played the piano for three hours non-stop.
I got a good one.
Did you find someone to take care of the baby?
I'm not saying anything.
He was chasing the thief.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom nodded in a voice.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not gonna say anything.
That would be good.

Tom is very shallow.
I said so.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda out safely.
They're my cousins.
It's already 11:00.
I'm gay, you know.

I can't wait to find out what gift Tom made me.
I saw it myself.
I want all my children equally.

That's the whole point.

I never say anything, even though it makes me nervous.
You're below his level.
My job is to knock.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
Tom may have hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry up to catch the last train.
Please, air the room.
Tom is still trying to persuade Mary to take the job.
How much of our bodies is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me stop Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't hold on for more than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
What took you so long?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom is sitting behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was set up.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
And it's because of chemistry that we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a fag.
What are you up to?
Why are you so mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping you.
No one else did anything.
Sorry to get in the way.
The books are new.
Thanks for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not asleep anymore.
Tom has spoken nicely.
They must be worried.
I got him.
That gave me an idea.
The Fedor clock broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you too.
Everybody, get on with me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom isn't very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It's worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do that somewhere else.
It scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to guard the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is a problem.
Tom grabs a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little bad at it.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's really good.
Let's get some sleep.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny character.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me. I'm not going to be here.
How many gallons of oil does he get in a storm?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
The crayfish is green.
Tom regretted what he said to Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom is grumbling.
I understand you.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm going to scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom is conscious.
Tom cut his hair.
Everybody's sitting down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like walking.
She seems a little young to be married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a meeting.
We're just getting started.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious about this.
You're not allowed to talk during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
- Shall I give you a signal?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you get me.
You should write a letter of thanks to Tom.
They won't be coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom has returned to Boston.
The light is gone.
- What?
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's taking his little dog for a walk.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's it.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone gains their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
The cloth gets a lot longer when it's washed.
The truth is a whole, not a destination.
I'm hiding him.
- You ever heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I ran away from class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without a duck, I'll have a hard time hunting.
Tom was sleeping.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the inhibitions.
Tom needs both of those.
I'll tell him to go right now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pups were black and deep as a pit.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him with the children a little more.
Everybody has drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you didn't forget something?
We were playing basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold.
- No, you don't have to.
I just wanted to clear the situation up.
Tom wears new shoes.
I'll call you back.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom has recovered.
Please repeat.
You're being very dramatic.
Tom is getting closer.
Tom didn't know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's a lot.
Why don't you buy more of these?
We tried.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You're too busy.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints at the crime scene.
I asked the same question.
I'm really hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's gonna tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come with you?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom is a dick.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this myself.
They've hired the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
The weather in April is unstable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm. I'm not going to be warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?

I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never really been anything but what I am.

I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Oh, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging a well for you.
I've got a few minutes left.
Wait a second.
Tom loves you very much.
You cook well.
There's no shortcut to the top, only to failure.
Tom is pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom is paid a lot.
It was a shame.
You seemed to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automated cars are now commonplace.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went out to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom carries chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give it your best shot.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I've been fooling Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The Orgullor was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I think you should help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You are a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making the cigars.
I like the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the myth.
Don't make fun of my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a furry rabbit.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be made.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the guida?
They picked her up nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three kids.
I'll give you mine.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a duty to spend the evening with a smart, spirited, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little bit of a jerk.
The girl runs away from home and is free from her parents' control.
Tom is a scumbag.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
The census was conducted in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
He said you were texting me, prequerer, but he lied to me, obviously.
Guess what.
He's got his clothes on to bathe.
I started to sweat a river all over my face.
Mary abandoned her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just put this to rest.
I'm getting a math degree.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you move?
Movies are a great pastime.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's only a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me like jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
She's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to inclement weather.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They might come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world is illuminating the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself into a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airfield is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom is not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The tap's not coming out.
Tom committed suicide.
Tom promises to look after Mary.
Mary likes hot coffee, and Tom likes soft coffee.
I gave you a fake address.
I got off.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm not happy.
I think so.
I think you're freaking out.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom snapped.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna be?
The girls sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were those guys?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm really going to try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I'm having a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him!
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is, can he or can't.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
You're not going to eat?
You have to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were inferior to you.
I need to tighten my belt.
Tom almost ran into Mary.
I hate my room.
Tom disobeyed his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's get some burgers.
You've probably seen much worse.
Have you spoken to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping in a chair.
I'm all weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's up with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom hiding?
Who won the prize?
Please, just be on time.
The Germans have a favourable attitude towards the holly.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't say that.
Tom is not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan went to the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they buried his body in a large tomb.
Women like men with beards.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I was never lucky.
His body was covered in brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I made Tom very angry.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in there.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's going to help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island's inhabitants are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted more mysterious characters.
Throw my ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm an anaemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the matter with the drop?
Tom is one of the most distinguished American songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom Swift will never come back here again.
No one likes tears.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would do that if I could.

Try explaining that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the way.
I know I can do more.
You learn fast.
We had a very good meal.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I was outed.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought some stinking garbage bags.
I have asthma.
He's used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling in Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is it all there?
Tom's passport has expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're very strong.
How could you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Can he do anything he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We've got bad news for them.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is not quite aware of what happened yet.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little bit more difficult.
You seem to know the answer already.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood was robbing the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the boat?
- Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was very helpful.
What do you usually do in your spare time?
I'll come and save you.
I got a stick in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope for a second.
Her long hair was bone-brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for a scarf.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
He didn't need to talk.
My forge hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't you talk.
They may need our help.
I got a couple of crowns.
I'm learning French.
Don't look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the top floor.
The girls aren't playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We have to call Tom.
They're going to hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need it.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him alone for a while.
I never wear a suit.
The grill is broken.
He's gone now.
His client is composed primarily of the poor.
None of us was right.
Find the difference.
That's awful.
Why do you mind?
Tom says he wants to do that, too.
Women like men with beards.
We spent the afternoon hanging out on the beach.
I care about them.
People are dying all the time.
He's a perfect fit for him.
Can you stop that?
Call me if there's a problem.
She's ruining her clothes.
Take your sword out.
I can't wait to get to Boston.
Tom was not happy to come.
Tom seems a little fatter.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom got his ass kicked.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that with you.
Did he ask for money?
Don't speak so loudly.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
You want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the turkey.
We're old friends.

That's one reason.
Give me the book back.
Marco thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are noisy.
I take this opportunity to thank her.

I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom is complicated.
Tom didn't want to get down.
Tom was suspended.
They were sucking.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like some marinated fish and seafood.
I was awful.
Tom seems upset.
Something is weird.
You're not old enough, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that's what got us into this?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
We hope it's all right.
You're good at it, but you're a loser.
She's been working at the embassy since three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
- Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.

It's work.
We'll get through this.

We'll work that out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed by weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.

He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At the time, the title dama was used only for nobles.

Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
You believe that?
How can a man choose only one?

I'm actually here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My cousin uncle was there, lying on the bloody bed, with a jaw rooted deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I get paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
It used to be so much fun.
Could you stay a minute?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your childish laughter.

As soon as he grew up, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.

I always write down.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?

Play it easy.
My son always interrupts me when I talk.
This is Tom.
I'll drive alone.

I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.

I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Can I borrow an interesting book?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
A sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I looked into the library yesterday.
I said my word.
You're being ridiculous.
Is that all we need?

When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is single.

What did Tom want to see?
I'm really scared.
Dan got mad.
I don't even know what's what.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.

It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.

What are you looking at?
I got a feeling it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come in a car.
I'm very grateful to you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than I did, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're awful.
Where does he live?
Mary is a real expert.
Excuse me for a minute.
I don't think I want to do that right now.

After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
In the tropics, there are only two seasons.
I think I made a pretty statement.
I'm replacing it.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this a transportation?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm having an affair with my ex-boyfriend again.
Just finish this job.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little bit of a kick.
What is Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't like it.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What's the sign above the door?
- Have a seat.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.

Tom would return.
She always works well.
What country are you a citizen of?
The trade in ivory is illegal.

I'm going to meet Tom.
I like dogs better than cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.

That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's not usually a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
He can't handle the heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
I'm sorry I can't let that happen.
I need you right now.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it that way.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Keep working.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm lonely, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
I guess we'll have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go and find her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
Here I am looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What kind of mother are you looking for in Boston?
First of all, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We almost do it together.
That's my plan.

Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.

Can you call her?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The forest was quiet then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was repressed.
We're playing with our destiny.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom doesn't know how to empathize.
There's still some tea in the cupboard.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The cow was making me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I'm too excited we're about to get to Pluto.
"I see", said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like that?
I have sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.

I don't want to lie.
Time is not money. Time is life.
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom isn't that tall.
It's been raining for a week, like.
He's recovering from his illness.
I like the word pop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'll take you to school.
The mole's in the ceiling.
Her face was stained with semen.
Tom is fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
I'm not doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
- Thank you. - Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating an apple.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd know what you were doing.
Tom aspires to become a teacher.
I wish you a good week!
You still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
You're too expensive.
We're acting like a child.
Tom was naked.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom is going upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
I can't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?

Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.

I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
It's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I'm not getting any use for it.
It's not raining yet.
Give me an example.
I definitely should buy you a drink.
If this happens again, call me.
- Was that honest?
The fence was empty.
Don't you talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give up.
They're close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.

I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.

Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom is wrong.

I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.

I'll bring it in.
It was a disaster!
Tom is good at his profession.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom arranged all this.
I'm not gonna betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's soft.
Before that, there was no plant life in this sub-sky.
You're not capable.
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I say.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did the right thing.
Tom is far away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.

Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
- Yeah, what?

It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not so good at it.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom isn't telling the truth.
Are you going to vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
There's no time for explanations.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, that breaks all the rules.
What are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's pretty much right.

The wound was bleeding.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.

Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look so beautiful.
Think what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
- You want to eat?

I did it.
Look at that.
Give me the French key.

It was a meeting.
Tom and Mary know what happened.

Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'm gonna keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in the eye and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
- You did?
I can touch the floor with my sleeves without bending my knees.
Tom is white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You've got to find them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom has come home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We could have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're a whore.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom is a snob.
I just cut my finger.
I'm going to ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He's a passive character.
Someone might have followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure for the disease.
We went to the coast.
I don't want you to bully them.
It depends on your decision.
That's a good one.
Tom reacted badly.
Is Mike out of liquor?
Tom was pointing you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was very pleased to meet her granddaughter.
It's our best shot.
It smells like flowers.
Tom snapped.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started to spike.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
It was a big deal.
She slowly developed a hatred of me.
I don't think they're the footage for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we agreed, didn't we?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I will never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
I'm stuck with my computer.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your purse!
And so our conscience really makes us all cowards.
You don't have to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You've made a mistake.
It's good to see you.
You can leave now, sir.
Maybe it was him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.

It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom is a farm worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
Since when has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He's suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What else are you eating?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a candy with a menthol?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They're going to do it.
I'm gonna have to stay the night.
I almost cut myself.
I'm going down here.
We are paranoid.
This is not silver.
There's a blood clot in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy guy to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She wants me to run.
I need a seafood.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom reads the note.
The kids were painting pictures on the sidewalk with the cream.
You're wondering why you've been holding on so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom got married at 26.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening to something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom often doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you do your homework today?
What is this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the majestic shrines she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's in the plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like a lot of rubbish.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
She's a good swimmer.
You're not gonna find us.
I've been talking to her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me all the time I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not sending.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to make Tom angry?
Triangles don't have four corners.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom is counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary, turn the carpet.
- Oh, my God.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Tell me what you said.
When did you buy that from us?
Let this be between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk to you.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom is wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me up as soon as they're gone.
Mr. Gorbachev, knock down the wall!
Tom seems upset.
Tom got caught.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
It's going to be hard.
I'm not feeling well in retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into that right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are empty.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was never meant to be sent.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks old?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's on his way.
I don't think Tom will fight much.
What are you talking about?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherits the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved before.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not urgent.
I'll get it now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll be there by the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will come.
Tom married Mary Laney.
Tom goes to school by car.
- Did you watch?
I'm gonna have to think this through.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody talks about me.
Do you ever think about us?
You write the sentences?
It was a great show.
We have to go find them.
The last time I was home was Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Put the hood down.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing this for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just a little candy.
What did Tom find out now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom is angry.
Tom will sleep.
Let's keep our peace!
Tom is well armed.
We took care of it.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them that much?
We've got to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
It's a boring TV today.
Oh, that's great!
Tom found a four-leafed detail.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We went to say hello to them.
Did you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scarf?
You're nothing and nobody.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds pretty valid.
It's the law!
The water's piercing the rock.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any complaining customers.
Well, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom is not my cousin.
Watch out for sparks flying from the fireplace.
It's just made up.
Tom was stalking Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I'm not gonna tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get some soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam anytime soon.
We're going to Boston.
Tom is a good father.
Stay here, all right?
Don't you know it's hopeless?

It was awful.

Kids love to have cake.
He was pretty tight.
I can finish with Tom.
Tom is nervous.
This is ours.
In case of an emergency, which number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all the money for Tom.
Enough of the bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to bark.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it's going to be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have everything.
I baked his cookies.
When's the school year over?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say hello?
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These are probably fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is irrefutable.
The girl's been weakening.
It's over between me and Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom is always here.
It left me in despair.
Tom screaming wakes up from a nightmare.
Tom has a weak vision.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
- Is that ready? - Yes.
Everybody wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are Tom's things?
Is the coffee hot?

- Open the door.
Put on your suit.
You could be wrong.
I baked the cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It was an honor.
I've been talking to my counselors about what items to take.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Does Dan know what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room underneath this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do that so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom is a nice man.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, get in there.
- Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I've got Tom on the set.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom knows how to be very vengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We're going to miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're being very bold.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or do I think so?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.

That's the way you should be.
I fell in love with you.
We're being fooled.
What do you want?
Tom has found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I have to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom still plays golf, doesn't he?
I over-eaten today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I can't see anything.
He's a very uncomfortable man!
He hanged his tent on the beach.
I didn't like that at all.
You'd better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one on the spot.
- Hold on a second.
- Would you like some cheese?
I'll call you.
He gets tired quickly.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not smart.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's a hole.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them spit you out.
Seizing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom probably left.
We didn't fight.
Tom is staring inside.
You are both heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with you or without you.
Let's just say you're right for now.
Tom is doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I almost got it.
Tom is a spineless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You missed us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They're all the same.
Don't forget that.
We have to find them first.
I'm taking the bill.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a bowl.
Tom will kill you.
We'd better both go to sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom is wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
The report is very well written.
You should help them.
Tom wasn't crying.
She's writing a book, and that's great.
Tom turned the corner.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more regrettable than stupidity and indifference.
They're all pissed.
Tom was protesting.
What do websites come from?
Vampires live forever. They are.
They both laughed.
What's that in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate the police.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon he won't be able to get out of bed.
You want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
How far is Boston?
I'm paid to help you.
My jacket is too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get that ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want me to.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom flew to Boston.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll see you about that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on his way to work.
You're being very direct.
Tom pulled the hose out of the bottle.
Tom will be there, too.
There's a guard on the way.
I can't confirm that.
Don't leave me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that's hung on the fireplace.
The pigeons symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
The traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
- The music of Enya is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now that's over.
I'm having a sleepy day.
There's no scientific evidence that there's a link between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom didn't work hard enough.
He's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom is a barber.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing a computer game.
Maybe you're right.
What's that?
This is a man's product.
We've been looking everywhere.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
- Push the button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's bothering her, anyway?
- Do you have the keys?
Tom rented his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All the lizards have eggs.
He's going to take action.
I think Tom is rude.
You didn't answer my letter.
We're all settled.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I'm watching the situation.
I make very stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
- Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just had dinner, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30.
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a bathroom.
A lot of trees fell.
Lions don't know the colors.
That wasn't right.
The answer is funny.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look at this.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
- Can I help you? - No.
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you married to Tom.
Tom is being polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm getting pus from my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We are in real danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to learn.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promises to stay in his room.
I'm putting the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They threw us an oath.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't say that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary thanking her for her help.
I decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
The wire lives a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very tightly.
Are you helping him?
She looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I can feel it.
Did you drive here?
I don't know the end of the story.
We're all through.
I'm sure you will.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're among friends.
I'm a little weakened.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call?
The question is who's gonna make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a hot night.
Thanks for seeing me.
Susan is actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'm preying on a little egg.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for the crazy.
Why would you help him?
Tom lights his shoes.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom is handing the manager over.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom borrowed me some money.
Am I bothering you?
End violence; fight for peace.
Look at me doing it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom. I'm going to get you.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna be really upset about that.
I'm a fag.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
May I have your dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to swim.
I should check.
Wait, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm running.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's blaming the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in his mailbox.
- Come on in here.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut back on my expenses for months.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom is grinding his face.
What good do I get out of you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
I get burned when she wears that dress.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They're living on the floor underneath this one now.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain, but I didn't click.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom is setting me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom is laughing at you.
I think I'm going to go out to eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
It narrows the election.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I've been using the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Third chance.
We have to get out.
This is airborne dough. It's popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let us strive for virtue and let us give up evil.
You're a smart guy.
I'm against the project.
- You're not tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie, you know?
I got here early.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is quite insecure.
He's got reports to write.
It hurts here.
You're making Tom nervous.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just watch it.
I was just biting you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to go to sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most unfavorable times.
The dog stared at me like he was trying to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin and they weren't real people at all.
The man is hungry.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
It's all fleeting, but the beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want for a drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
That was really nice.
Everybody dies every once in a while.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I've been thinking about her for days.
I suggest we focus on seeking an exit from the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a monstrous building.
Tom was not disappointed.
- Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it!
Is this exactly in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She's got ears like a hedgehog.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't quite know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try it.
I'm not misunderstood.
Tom is harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom withdrew.
Don't say that again.
The greys are red.
Maybe we can find something.
You look good.
You're making Tom miserable.
Heat it up.
Tom seemed to be upset.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally strong.
She's a very happy girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started walking.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't let it fall off.
I got a 9 on the chemistry test.
He was lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was picky.
How was the toy?
I'm a student.
It's my secret.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your wheel on the edge.
They moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was stupid to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
The titles should be readers' attention.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than submit.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
They did it.
I was watching a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was making fun of Mary.
Tom is full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's illness is a lie.
Dan had a tumultuous relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
- Call us now.
Maybe Tom could sing at our wedding.
Who would Tom choose?
The hospital over there isn't that big.
Most people have to work to survive.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary is pregnant.
We're staying here.
I don't fuck their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't want to serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty at the age of 10 to 11 years, and boys at the age of 11 to 12 years.
It's gone.
Tell Tom that he must not forget to renew his passport.
The sky will be clear soon.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I can't tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was subsidized.
The cheap one was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door locked?
I have a big head.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
She likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't drag yourself when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
What book are you reading?
You're burning the car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
The sexes are females.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
Those are Tom's dogs.
Where's the wool?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do community service to make up for everything I've done.
Tom tied his ropes.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is wonderful.
This sentence can be translated in many different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the oxen poisonous?
The kidnappers tied their eyes.
You're lying to me, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary has been a great supporter.
Tom is in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom is not interested.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who kicked Tom.
Tom knows a button.
You've seen what I can do.
We got a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can you get me?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom has gone mad.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's not looking well.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
The hairs have a sharp appearance.
I wrote that for them.
I used to live in Boston last year.
Tom was ringing.
We need a new rug.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom politely smiled.
The Chaincon is pretty volcanic.
You need to get some sleep.
Tom took off his mattress.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather's from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has been reactivated.
Tom told me that he needed to take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The little island from a distance looks like a deer.
Are the stems getting dirty?
What did Tom ask?
Stop being a clown.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait. I'll get you out of here.
You don't know how long it's gonna be.
The dog was barking.
Let's go to the movies.
The good women age much better than the beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He's got it.
Mary felt her face warming up.
I know what's so troubling Tom.
I thought Tom retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom is a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I'm fine with that.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom is unnecessarily chewing gum.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do that for her.
I'm not taking the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know how to make words?
It hurts so bad here.
I hate the rug.
I'm a little sick.
Tom cut it off.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left the charm.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That's done.
It's not natural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the work he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kinder to each other.
Tom is a substitute.
I think I better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everyone's pissed off.
Faith means hoping for what the mind cannot hope for.
Tom was with me.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're wasting your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The darkness is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They've elected a new government.
I'll wash the dishes. Okay, I'll wipe them.
I would buy it.
He's the one who's pulling back.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom is wet.
They asked for a raise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was going to be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom isn't here today.
If I hadn't eaten, I'd like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The grill stopped working.
I mean, he's the one.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Drop the weapon down.
- See you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I don't know how to do that yet.
It's like a little bit of a hoax.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
- You got it?
My day was busy.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's got the flu.
I'm not waiting too long.
Just look at yourself.
This is great.
It's missing a blank in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should see a dentist.
The soldiers were firing.
Tom can't take that.
The store's closed.
- I'm not going to.
Tom went out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom is angry.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
He broke it.
Tom is a big boob.
Can I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm asleep now.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He's like an eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the trash in the storm.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
Will you think about it?
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at a desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk that fast.
You go get Tom and get back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off your mask.
It's definitely one option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm just going to go.
I like the way you dance.
I need a little.
They've been lying to us.
Tom is that right.
Tom seems scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now order it.
She's white.
- Have a seat.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me out tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
The Condors are tearing me down.
Tom said nothing about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
I like being alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he has no friends.
Each color has its meaning.
The old house was in a bad state.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I'm out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your police force is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I clap.
You've been scolding me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice's melting.
I bleed out.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
It must have been a lot easier for you.
I was never caught.
I love my country.
I'm not taught to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't you dare to screw me.
Tom is comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is a miserable one.
They're looking in the mirror.
It's not my nature to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Mary to the door.
It looks really good.
I need to understand.
You two have come up against me!
I've never worn a sleeping bag in my life.
Don't sleep in the bathroom.
Tom tried everything.
- Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm a music student.
I didn't have that bad time.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm very proud of that.
Make sure you don't count.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys even talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary caught a fish.
It's weird sitting at home.
It's not that bad.
They're laughing.
Did Tom ask him why he was late?
It's probably not worth the wait.
I have to buy a new row for the room.
Tell Tom to write me.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What is this about, exactly?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us out as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom made a promise.
Tom and Mary have been on us since day one.
Let's move.
The girls are running and playing.
I'm not sure that's what Tom did.
You're not going to eat the spaghetti?
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off his mattress.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high soles.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom isn't that tall.
She wears a leather belt on the belt.
They're putting out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom got rid of Mary.
I'll go and find them.
Tom came despite the rain.
I don't like to use a deal - I prefer real chickens.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
He doesn't fight.
I expect your help.
Tom will go alone.
Tom only had five in school.
Tom agrees with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
It was great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The lock has a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom is allergic to pollen.
They've contacted the meat politicians.
Tom is taking notes.
They gave me the card.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat an apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom is weird.
That was really nice.
My dad gives me a $10 a week wallet.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long have you been working for them?
I have to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom is pissing me off.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you're drinking wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with milk, right?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us and help us move the keyboard.
Tom used to be shy.
It's cooling down.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I'm not going to lie.
I'm looking for you.
You want robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really burned me.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear touches itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three cups of fake sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The shovel has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I was wondering.
Tom isn't doing what he should be doing.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What's for dinner?
What did you do then?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less grim than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you cut the price a little bit?
I'm going to leave first.
Tom is thirty years old now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a chuckun-baby just days before her ninety-nineth birthday.
Did you look everywhere?
It's important to remember that nobody is ever anything 100%.
He gestures while he speaks.
Sit down with me.
Tom is enthusiastic.
Tom never gives money to anyone on loan.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. However, because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest.
Scientists say that people who laugh more often live longer than those who are hit by a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom picks up the tree.
The earth is still under water, and the sword will probably give up.
I was falling asleep.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked chicken?
The dog was following me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom is gone.
She's working her way up to an actress.
My plastic bottle is broken.
Is this our cabin?
Let's get this done.
We're finely grounded.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's brilliant.
Tom is very careless.
The cloud is expected to sink into the urine.
I can get a message to her.
The little red one.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions about them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood and kept quiet.
I'm collecting stamps.
We'll be in Boston this time tomorrow.
- You live here?
This room looks like a motel.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom is a footballer.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The pigs are soft.
It's not important.
I like comics.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the stupid uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
The beans fall from the tree.
You got a band?
You can wait here.
I got a five in French.
I want the class to shut up.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How fast is it to the post office from here?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's not scary.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you gonna wear a mask this year?
I'll do what you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's locked.
Tom asked for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He's going out.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're making me feel stronger.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom is a nice man.
The eagle is the king of the birds.
I'll call you later.
This is a price.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk about this.
I think Tom is nice.
The sky is clear.
The grass will wake the baby.
Just look right.
That's not something you should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing rims.
I've made my decision.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
You think Tom would prefer a son.
How did you get here?
She turned the book up.
Don't take my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm going to do that.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's got it.
He's got an appetite from the long walk.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself a cup of tea and a croft.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't make Tom swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to.
They both laughed again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom is in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest man in his class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only consolation.
No one would have cared.
Did you write in the diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do this alone?
Is that your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom. What are you doing?
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking boiling water can cause illness.
We're up and down.
Tom has a hard ear.
I bought them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
He doesn't like me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the tap.
I helped him open the table.
I had a ham and a ham last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is ugly.
I'm sorry I ever said anything to them.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Get me back in two and a half.
Tom fell asleep.
I slept in the barn.
I kind of enjoyed it.
It might work.
Aren't you cold with short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
She has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom rarely comes late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any real Japanese movies?
- Did you get them?
French was originally slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife prove her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe he didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you cookies.
That can work.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded the schedule you sent me to Tom.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun if we went to the party.
Don't save the bell.
He's wrapped me around the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems overwhelmed.
You're having fun keeping you young.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems lonely.
What do you mean, you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you'll be here by 2:30.
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells bad.
So I need to know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm not a big deal.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom is fat.
Tom said it was time for dinner.
I don't want to swim.
We just broke into Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I would have sold the dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody is talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom is a badass.
We despise her.
He got ahead of them.
Here, brother, half of it.
Tom sent the new mushroom he had just bought to the table.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom is a smoker.
The landscape is transitable.
It's closed.
I found the papayas under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test him.
Freedom of speech was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating his victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to get some sleep.
Autumn is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic?
It only takes three minutes to dive into the water.
I could get fired for this.
What's the plan?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk! You know what?
It was just magnificent.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to enroll in a class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, endowed with reason and conscience, and should treat one another in the spirit of common humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a grime.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything himself.
What's the best part?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
This soup is too salty.
Why don't you go get it?
Tom continued to practice.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom's staring into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
It seems familiar.
I'm jealous of you.
I offered to blow his chicken, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosil, jasper, rosemary, thymane, and origano are popular herbs.
We are ugly.
You're a penetrative man.
It all seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He's sitting on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I don't get paid much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
I'm kind of flattered by it.
I'm working out.
She may have lied to you, but she didn't lie to me!
Let's just get some fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I got sick.
Tom put his hand in his bag and pulled out some coins.
The room was a cabinet.
It's just to solve this problem.
They've got to remove the bullet that was stuck to his back.
It's fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good, you know.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to get a blowjob.
We're importing wheat from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan before.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he is.
Tom is not there because he is sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers don't help with the ice.
I was pretty late.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
It doesn't seem appropriate to ask Tom.
My brother's coming tomorrow, baby.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the cups calorific?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary over the rib.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go and ask him.
You're lucky I didn't take you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This asshole has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him make up.
I was waiting for her outside.
You are impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing stones at me.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry about Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They're standing under the railing outside the store to avoid the rain.
I'm missing a couple of reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my mistake.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I'm gonna have to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm going to check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all doubted.
I'm still thinking about her.
I found out today that there's a movie called The Russians Are Coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
- Thank you. - Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom still can't write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying for it.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom is in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thanks for yesterday.
- You got enough?
The deaf are the transmitters of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom is complaining.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I'm not that good at writing.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm fed up with Tom.
I want roasted bones.
What was Tom doing here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic accident.
They've got us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was just wonderful.
Tom greets Mary with a whisper.
It's all right.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
- Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom is a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
You need help with something?
It's so wonderful.
I don't understand English, not even German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off the mountain.
I'm just starving to death.
I was disqualified.
- Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too worried about him.
The president announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't borrow your book.
There's no way he's getting out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
- Am I too early?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom is old-fashioned.
Is this right?
- Would you like to stop?
Watch your step, Tom.
Tom tied his ropes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should quit?
That doesn't make sense.
Women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what had happened.
The trees are green.
Tom is dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom is not listening to us.
Tom is a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom decided somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
Is there an excuse?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'm staying here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's an indisputable fact.
- Is it good?
- Watch your step!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is bucket.
We don't talk much.
You're a very kind man.
Tom got a little grumpy.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black.
Tom gave himself up to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like God, and Osaka is like Medellin.
You stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are a type of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big tank.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the train going?
I wiped my wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Oh, my God, it's really late.
You're going to be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a shrimp out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the parachute.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do what I can.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was visual.
I want a life.
Tom is not in his bed.
This was all my idea.
I don't want any riddles.
The book will help you write craft.
This area is in a valley.
You really want to stay until Monday?
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston to join me.
Please, blow the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary in the bathroom before.
They've got their cat toast on.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I assume the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love the sunscreens.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get it back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is impressed.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the count.
I was impressed with your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
- Hi, how are you? - Good.
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the mattress off.
That's what happened before.
I have my theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
Tom can help you too.
I wonder why we left.
What good is that gonna do us?
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
How are you? Good, thank you.
Mary was a wonderful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
To me, every Finnish sentence is a quick-wrap.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might get along.
Why did you leave me?
I don't like spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were pretty confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom is not good for sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt the need to redeem himself.
It's a message for them.
When will I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm going to say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He hit the dog with a rock.
Tom stared intently.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
So you wrote the book yourself!
Don't put that much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be imaginary.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must clear it.
Tom is not well today.
We can't see.
Mahmoud cannot bear to lose.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, convince me.
I'm ready for it now.
- It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetting and hating usually go together.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
I'm out of pants.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make it uncomfortable for you.
If I had wings, I'd fly right up to you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted to drinking red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Laura.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would have known that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedantic in his work.
Come on in the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did this?
You're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs a day?
Are you going to cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a cooker.
You have very piercing eyes.
Isn't that what you mean?
I thought he was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom go back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let it in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems confident.
Do you want a drink of water?
Tom is not sociable.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four corners.
I kept working.
He's developed an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and they were silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary was hurting her mother.
Choose one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the meal.
Tom wiped the cutting edge of the farmer's knife.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them called me.
I can make that happen.
Are the Germans bleeding?
Just let me have that one, okay?
Tom put his beer wing on the hook.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
I got a very attractive look.
Come on, don't be ashamed of yourself.
I wouldn't want to eat cloned meat.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you get off?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom is lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
She looked at me sharply through the glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he had blackmailed her.
Why would they mind?
Let's not get in Tom's way.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
It's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to be nice.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Is Tom hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It came through my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression at various times in his life.
Shall I take your clothes?
It would have given me my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll give it a shot.
What's the matter?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is up.
There were penguin traps on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a sleeper.
I want to shave my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
- Sit down. - What?
I'm not fast.
We need to talk face to face.
Tom is not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a cottage near Boston.
I hope you'll like the new boss.
Did he mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was hungry.
She's studying English.
With such a big dream, he'll either become a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We're here to apologize.
We're going to visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom blew the chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to acquire bad habits!
She's starting to behave strangely.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she developed an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think knows the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're as strong as you.
The president looked strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad to see you.
I'm gonna be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played better chess than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary is Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a small town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stuck.
Grab the day.
What's the bell, Tom?
He's very handsome.
- Let the buyer be careful.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now is the time for reparation.
Most virgins have a hymn.
You can go out at the end.
Why did you just spray two sausages?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll be all right.
Does she have that dog?
I'm tired of it.
Mary was wearing fake scarves.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the speech.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calms the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's American.
Just relax a little bit.
Is Tom amused?
Tom and Mary don't know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help finding her.
The bread is ground, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom finished the job in a furry way.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed nervous.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I make the decision, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works.
Tom got badly ill.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
We'll never know now.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy your day.
Tom just went crazy.
I prefer goat cheese to cow's cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Are they all having fun?
I was up all night.
I have an unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was a tongue.
The ceilings are cutting down trees.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Winter is over.
Same-sex couples should not be allowed to marry.
The cow forgot that she was once a calf.
Give them the picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is hand-made.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister squeeze the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you turn off the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would you trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's still no sign of Tom or a voice.
I was home then.
Don't push me. I'm not going to.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk about this.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other lies.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is said to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I have to feed them.
She's always soulless.
They're all over the place.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He lifted me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
After lunch, we plan on taking a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light went on.
John's at the airport.
Tom should have been ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.

I'm sure you'll be all right.
Are you eating at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you kidding me?

I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give Tom a piece of shit.

You'd be a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?

I'm in there.
Do you need a rental?

Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to re-infect.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not sure Tom is guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom is good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom will wait.
I'm hungry for you to come.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your mistake.
The balloon was slowly descending.
Who wants insects?
It's a shit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.

My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You didn't mean it, did you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't mean anything to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten?

We're going to beat him.
- It's all right.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.

Tom must have done that.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost there.
He married me.
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York City from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my feet.
How can you say that?
Tom caught a fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The person who pays the bills has a right to be master.
You are very lucky.
Yeah, get me some cough.
When are you coming to visit us?
Tragedy happens every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening to you.
Give me those leaves.
You can have mine.
Tom won't like that.
All the comments are unnecessary.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?
Tom broke his mouth.
It smells like cheese.
Tom is not deluded.
The patient is suffering from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
A virtue without gold is better than gold without honor.

Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I slept there for hours.
Tom was holding a drink in his hand.
What a pair!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints have disturbed me.
I'm naked now.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.

It's noisy out here.
What can be done?
I guess you found it.
Don't take that literally.
Tom is quite eloquent.
I'll help you find her.
Tom hasn't called Mary.
I think Tom is crazy.

Whose house is this?
Tom would have fallen without Mary's help.
Tom is cooperating.
The snow is one foot deep.

How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's footing the stake.
I'm going to go find Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will work for now.
They need to talk.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not that you're wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There's no life without pain.
You've got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me an asshole.
I'm very attracted to you.
What's for dinner?
Open the ninth page.
Tom dug up his jacket.
Tom was overwhelmed.
The Iranians are a peace-loving people.
What can we do about her?
I really like wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Does Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't shit or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
I don't want to be here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the bridge.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
You seem right.
He escaped to avoid capture.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom is not back yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom is parked. He'll be right back.
Love me a little, love me a long time.
Tom is in the living room watching cartoons with the children.
There's no answer to everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his family what had happened.
He was in mud to his knees.
You told Tom about it, right?
Tom called Mary.
Tom is not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Aren't you freaking out?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom is sensitive.
He's a real man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We're going back.
Is there anyone else?
That's good news, though, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't that exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
I'm easy to talk to.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of interpunct marks is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why are you hesitating?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want to take you home?
That house is built of bricks.
We haven't come to any conclusions.
Tom came in around 2:30.
It doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I'm scared of cats.
The crowd clapped.
I'm leaving the little ones growing on the edges.
I think Tom is mean.
The door was locked.
I'll get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
What are you looking at now?
They're all gone.
I was too tired to go on.
Everything has its sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call last night from a guy named Tom Jackson.
Can you use this page like Twitter?
It shouldn't be too hard to finish the report by 2:30.
Tom has been doing that for a while.
Heteronormativity is closely related to sexism.
She has a footprint.
Are those your haircuts?
What's your reason for learning English?
Has Tom already left?
Tom must have been making a big deal.
Tom is still home.
A movie is worth watching.
My breasts are growing.
I'll talk to you by tomorrow if I get to explain everything.
Dan is back in London.
My dad bought me a digital watch for my birthday.
You know me better than that.
Tom is a human trafficker.
Don't you feel lonely?
- Have you made coffee?
Don't get too excited about it.
Get up when you call me.
He's always been cheerful.
The forest was very peaceful.
I have to get back to them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom is insistent.
Most of the clothes worn by Europeans are produced outside Europe.
Tom is still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look on the Internet.
When I was younger, I always used to drive a bus.
I couldn't figure out what exactly was the problem.
Maybe Tom will complain.
It's so obvious we don't need any proof.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet is in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here?
When I pee, something like rust comes out.
He beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I play the backhand often.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
That'll teach them the rules.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom is a nut.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks the book is so good.
Tom was hired.
Time has passed very quickly.
There's no way out.
The heavy rain at night made it difficult to rescue the survivors of the wreck.
My wife's hiding something from me.
What can we offer our guests?
Tom was angry.
Look at the count.
There must be a key.
Half the apple.
All the balls are yellow.
I have a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Lie down on the couch.
Did they hit someone?
The factory makes toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can see for myself.
The room has a view of the ocean.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like a commodity.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of humanity.
It's still on sale.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
Every now and then, I would be passed by by wagons.
Tom put down the gun.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job in a day.
He was almost terrified.
I suddenly felt old.
They're making me nervous.
It was getting dark.
I'm ready to go.
You killed him to avenge your late father.
Tom took a cookie.
I've been teaching French since I was 13.
Men aren't really that different from women.
Eugenia shared her favorite facial and skin care oils with us.
It's French all over my head.
I don't care if there are 20 women.
The bull is hurting.
Tom is walking.
Are you guys open tonight?
They don't understand.
He was born in the '60s.
- Can I have one?
Grandmothers are usually mild in taste.
I'm needed.
It might rain today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You are beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
- Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I'm not gonna screw you.
Stay here and watch her.
Wouldn't you start getting hair out of that?
How are you gonna get away?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg is broken.
How are you going to accomplish that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We are Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these menjis from my grandmother.
I have no problem with drinking.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I wondered who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's not right.
It's in excellent condition.
I grabbed Tom for milk.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I've never heard of them.
I have to help them.
- Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.
You look good.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's happening.
The cow will wake the baby.
I was sleeping late.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting in the living room with Mary watching television.
Nothing's bothering us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom is wearing a stethoscope.
It's nice to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I'm not usually at work on Mondays.
I was a fool to believe them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to church every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a crowd at the bar.
They've been rejecting the idea.
Tom wondered more and more.
Who gave them that much money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did the dishwasher work?
Tom is a married man.
Like Tom said, the soup is too salty.
Did I miss much?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come out?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's a huge one.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this all about?
You're gonna have to study on an occasional basis next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
- Oh, my God!
I should have asked them first.
Tom may be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just let him go.
Where was he born?
Tom took two seats.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Pick the one you like the most.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Don't get discouraged now.
It's like her style.
I've had enough of fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a reporter.
Sarah has 31 pencils.
This is very confusing.
I have terrible news.
If possible, I would like to experience once again that bitter-sweet love as I had always done.
I saw Tom around.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom got the movie.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom suggest this?
Did Tom ask who helped him with his homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We all want to see the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We broke up the conversation.
I'm training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't concentrate on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became addicted.
I just want money.
I don't say dirty things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I'm completely healed.
I was the only one who knew where Tom was going.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't read.
Is there any sugar?
Dan and Linda eventually moved to London.
She suddenly passed out.
It looked funny.
Tom plays in a band.
We live together now.
You were busy.
Excuse me, is that a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship has changed course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
What's that crazy about?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-Li-Li!
Tom said that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you'll have to work your ass off.
- What? - Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-wing.
Shall I paint with or without a flash?
He and his sisters were eating ice cream while the radio was off.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom is in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem myself.
They're too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom is now an adult.
We don't sell alcohol or cigarettes to minors.
I took the bus back.
This is how we do it.
Tom doesn't behave like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The battle doesn't seem to be coming to an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom is a rat.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom didn't play.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and done.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mom put your collage in the top drawer.
You've had a car accident, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't waste our party.
I can do that.
I'm not discriminating.
I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a month.
It is advisable to check whether there may be any side effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you have been prescribed.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I got on board.
I like to swim.
It was her.
We can talk to Tom.
I assumed it was free.
You're gonna need some help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started climbing.
Tom really likes you.
Tom leaned on Mary.
This is the first time I've ever put a beaver on an egg.
I'll get it right.
The cure worked.
Tom can play guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I'm sick of Tom.
I really like you.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't think I bought this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier on the left.
Get up once more, you lazy one!
How long ago was that?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I'm not gonna wait to find out.
Let's continue the conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he is so tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that he had no internal injuries.
I feel like I cheated on you.
You're always tired.
Who's going to hurt you?
I'm stuck with you.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love the golf.
No one really likes us.
It's very rare.
I'm not good for this.
Tom clawed at the candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
It's all set.
She's not in the mood.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
- You know what?
- Is that all?
Tom is listening.
Can anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I'm in love with you.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It was hard.
- Shake your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be chained.
I'd rather go alone.
He was one of them.
I want to go to bed and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital recovering from an overdose.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were planning on shooting Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him, she hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom get me.
Tom is already here.
They seem busy today.
I'm sure Tom has never been to Boston.
I think I should look at Tom.
Just give it your best shot.
Tom is a face.
When you go out on a date, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is distrustful.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid of the bowl up.
That's good training.
This chair is a signature.
I should have said no.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactic.
I've lived here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my lib.
I know you've done your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the bookcase cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I should feel sorry for them.
I'm not complaining.
- Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I'm not commenting on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is just a ball.
I want to live in Brazil.
- You know what?
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take Tom in.
It's just words.
There was a moment of silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met in Boston last year.
Tom is over-pushing.
No one walks in L.A.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't care.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was insupportable.
I agree with the plan.
Justice is expressed by works.
I don't know if you know or not, but here in America, you're supposed to leave a tip to the waiter.
That was childish of him.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Go while you still can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable around Mary.
I don't need them.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the wagons.
I was kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
The tea is very tasty.
We're on the same page.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom is very strict with himself.
She's a bug.
The lemonade is cold.
The lamp was sliding back and forth.
Tom seems insecure.
I have nothing else to ask for.
Tom is a materialist.
- We can't do that.
Why should I care about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my box.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
See her banded up in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
She fell from the tree.
Tom told Mary that he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you catch a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see it.
I'm on my way.
I was in a half-sleep.
Do not expect everyone to share the same view.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will get lost.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something hurt.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I've been staring at the man.
Watch out for Tom.
They look familiar.
We got work to do.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in the fish.
I want you to be with me.
I like to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get some sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snow Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom is new to town and needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a locked room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
You're going on foot?
You should try it.
You're pretty busy with worries.
I don't think Tom will help us much.
Tom seems worried.
I'm taking care of him.
Tom is amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom is approaching.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is compassionate.
Let it be short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could have made it.
This is no one's fault.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran all the way.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped with a pool, a rink, a soccer court and a pool table.
Tom claims that he wants to learn French.
We are all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking questions about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was annoying his sister.
We should have quit earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom is polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
Why are you doing this? I can do it.
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom is letting go of the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that bad.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and confident and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going to kneel down.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not going to get lost.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher's.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you believe them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two genus in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who are you living with?
So what do I tell him?
Where's your baby?
Tom's in bed talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating some pasta.
Can you translate it?
We are lucky.
You probably think I'm a crook.
Where did Tom work?
I need a lift to carry them.
The noise has been all over the city.
A person who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This is not bullshit.
They came close.
You're mean.
Did you hand Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who can speak English?
Tom was beating.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears a suit.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem. This is my problem.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom may be wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have any water.
Tom is acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you wasted everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
Why did you want to see me?
I think I figured out what time we should be leaving.
They're very good.
You like movies?
Time is forever.
First, you have no right to draw conclusions, and second, your argument was based on a false assumption.
Who would blame him?
I think the audience is bored.
I'm a farmer.
She borrowed the line.
I'll see you around.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to borrow her keys.
Tom has a beard.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom participate?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Choose one.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and rejected.
I wish I could have helped you more.
Tom doesn't look anymore.
I think we're ready.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They were completely renovating the building's facade, and when I drove past it, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all he has?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's right.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in circles on the floor.
Tom forgot.
- Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
I gave him a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing can happen to us.
There I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting divorced.
That dinner.
My weight is leaking.
You'll get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser was pouring a pinch of hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not proposing to give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom continued to pack.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here on my own.
It's to protect you.
I always had someone to help me.
They don't like it.
Tom takes over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said that if he won the lottery, he would buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You'll have to ask your mother's permission first.
I'm taking Tom's place.
What was your plan to come to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're looking for chickens a lot.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I was having lunch.
Tom remembered a variety of things that no one else remembered.
You can tell them easily.
I'm going to go find her.
Of all the languages I've learned, French was the easiest.
Tom wrote homework.
I counted to 200.
- Keep this.
- Shall I go?
Boy looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have a roast goose with a pickle.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did he borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is wonderful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I pretend to be?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm going to lose everything.
I need some food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have a homework assignment.
He was breathing deeply.
That's ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
- Is it a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do what I want.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'm going to be all right.
I've been doing something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a lovely alka.

You're the prisoner.
Tom was teasing Mary.
Were you home alone?
He blackmailed a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me solve this?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'll find another one.
I'm too hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make a spider.

You want me to keep it?
You're a real human being.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's in charge?
I'm a little pissed off.
I think we'd better not drink this water.
No one is talking.
What made you contact them?

- Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.

There's one thing I don't understand.
He's having fun listening to music.
Try on the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom did not accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party would start?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was doing a very good job.
My legs still hurt.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I lost my mind.
It's hard to judge his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting over there.

Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me that he would like me to come to his guests tomorrow afternoon.

It was pretty disgusting.

I'll check on you later.
- Is there food?
I'll cooperate.

This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She broke her leg when she fell off her bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Come on over here!
You could have said no.
Why wouldn't you let me help?
It's going to happen soon.
Hey, it's crowded in here, get me out of here before I drown.
It's going to happen what's going to happen.

It was hot yesterday, but it's more resilient today.
I'm all right.
He was ahead of me.
Give me that back.
Are you breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This is not fair to me.
Someone might have followed them.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a safe.
I almost met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.

You want me to come to your place?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He just left.
The children were so excited about the party that they couldn't sleep.

It wasn't very good.

Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm a cloistered person.
Tom didn't tell me he didn't know how to swim.
Tom quickly lost his way in the crowd.
As far as you know, I'm not interested in it at all.
No, I'm still poor.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That's what surprised me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you leave when we kiss?
Somebody's going to see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I totally misjudged her.
It'll be over in a little while.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.

We'll have to wait here.
Are you all right?
Does that sound familiar?
How much do you want?
Tom is bleeding.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came after them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Is Mike out of liquor?
You and I are gonna be on the same plane.
Tom is not coming back.
Tom promises me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom is not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does class start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You guys were amazing.
I'm not giving up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the branch with its bow and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man he was three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom is pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll have Tom make time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of it.
What am I gonna do?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
This is not the time.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom is not an old man.
The question is how did Tom do that?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a swimsuit?
His nose is the best feature.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
He's a tough guy.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a question of where.
The lightning's on.
Tom was affected.
I'm in a bad mood.
How did you know Tom was going to lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom got drunk with tequila.
My grandmother is a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're doing a lot of digging.
We need more money.
It's not lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom is getting something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I pay my respects.
Have mercy.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those clubs are mine.
- Was the trip good?
You guys have to work together.
Show me your hand.
Those are hunting dogs.
You should make it a habit to brush your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom has gathered his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom is an excellent doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary isn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to light your car.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
You were lying to me.
I'm going to find her.
I wanted to leave.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
They'd just interrupt Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom is going south.
Love is like oxygen.
- That's for you.
That's a very subtle explanation.
The morning walks are refreshing.
Because the notebook was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They're planning a murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom had worn the shirt backwards.
When was the last time you cleaned the room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Tonight was a hell of a night!
You control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, division is not.
I bet you.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom is going to go.
Whose manuscript is this?
See what the papers say today?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six cups of coffee a day.
Tom groaned loudly.
It was Better.
Tom started yelling.
I'm gonna ask you to stay a little longer.
We're keeping two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everybody pointed at her.
Tom might die by the pool.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was crazy.
The drawer is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom lowered his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My pair of glasses are soaked.
So it wasn't a no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the alo flag?
Get settled down!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You're going to try, aren't you?
Tom has been without food for a whole week.
I don't understand you at all.
Though I am a pious man, I am still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get mad at me.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
Can I talk to you?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to investigate something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm all right!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary kept it down.
We met in the meana.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I've been around the city looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom is not a member.
Looks like our job is to keep that from happening.
Why is the universe black?
I got guilty.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was haunted.
I baked you a piece of bread.
The marzipan pigs are not eating us.
Tom has regained consciousness.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is good at it.
Tom may come today.
Tom can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
- Will you help me?
Don't let me down.
Tom wasn't home when I returned.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's go one more time.
Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We left at 11:00.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
- I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is of another dimension.
I'm bored of them.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure yet.
Every member must attend.
She didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and deprived.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
You know what it's called?
It doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me get a message to Tom.
Where's my golf kit bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The beef is made of wheat.
Don't touch me, please.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on that subject.
You're right, you're right.
I'll be right there.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's get back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'm going to eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You look beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You cut your keystone while you were playing.
I think Tom is funny.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pencil.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was upset.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please report them.
I have to call her.
He asked if I could make something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop by the way.
I heard Tom scream.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my time on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Let me go.
The rock was pushed down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom is crazy.
- Come on, again!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
There's no need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom is not so young.
At the time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin is very cute.
You're such a tough guy.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was fine here.
They look like they're screwed.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I would never leave home on a poppy.
I think Tom is a squirrel.
She got a terrible infection and the ovary blew out.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't cost us.
It's not coming up.
Tom went to the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's acting weird sometimes.
We'd have hanged them.
Now is probably not the time for this.
I'll be back in a second.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How did it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapable.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of crackers.
You're very influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake out of the closet?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Each language views the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
- This time.
This is holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom would want to come and drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We have it all.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was on top of the bucket.
I'm ready for that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for a Monday?
I think Tom is dying.
I'm just wet.
Are you getting a kick out of it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling you.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I made a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are he gathering in this room?
I've thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've been through a lot.
Are you still there?
You're a predictor.
I was a little bit of a jerk.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
No one wants to buy these things.
Neither here nor there.
The phone numbers are fascinating.
You don't have to be defensive.
This is the best pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
