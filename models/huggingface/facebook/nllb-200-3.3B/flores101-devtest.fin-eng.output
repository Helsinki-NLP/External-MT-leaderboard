This confirms the already widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored on the bottom, according to the researchers.
The discovery also helps us understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed cartilage called cartilage, but do have other features of feathers - such as gills and feathery rays - the researchers concluded that cartilage likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for thermoregulation or for soothing, and although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggested that the specimen was from the plumage of an adult rather than the gills of a young one.
Although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers presented the specimen as being from the plumage of an adult rather than the plumage of a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the Gaziantep police headquarters in Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than 20 others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is associated with the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less polar reversals a star will experience.

The work was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team hoped to detect the tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon's gravitational pull affects the earth, causing tides, so too does the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affect the dwarf galaxy of Sagittarius.
The researchers were able to deduce that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the galaxy's dark matter is surrounded by a kind of radiant cloud, made up of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll found a highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant is very worrying and alarming because of the extremely high mortality rate.

Voting in France has traditionally not been high-tech: voters lock themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope, marked with their choice of candidate.
After the identity of the voter has been confirmed by the authorities, the voter drops the envelope on the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law has determined the course of events with comparative precision.
In 1988, the ballot boxes were made transparent to allow voters and observers to prove that the envelope was not in the box when voting began and that no envelopes were being added to the box other than the officially counted and authorized votes.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the series of events, and in the evening, volunteers will count the votes under close supervision and following prescribed procedures.

The accused have been identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
But the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
He's being held in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may have been tampered with, as his photograph has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts have considered that the publication of images could prejudice the fairness of the trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University observes that "journalists do seem to be balancing dangerously when they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Office, the Scottish public prosecutor with general responsibility for the prosecution, has made it clear to journalists that it will not comment further on the matter, at least not until the prosecution is brought.
The document, according to Vuoto, refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to be the way they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other subjects discussed were the future status of holy Jerusalem for both nations and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority accepts such a presence for only five years.
The rangers were to monitor closely the hunters participating in the supplementary control experiment, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Eligible volunteers were recruited as part of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW Federation of Australian Sporting Riflemen's Association's joint project and as part of the Federation's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and cultural heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shots received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly (GUE/NGL). - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr De Gucht, for his report.
It's the fifth interim election for Martelly in four years.
The presidentially-appointed delegation recommended last month the dismissal of the previous interim election council as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The council was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which have at times turned violent, were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
Over 60 incidents of overheating of iPods that were not working properly were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, the department announced that Apple had told it of 34 other cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the investigation "really unfortunate".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. Greenwich time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken hostage a group of Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at a group of tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the toilet, and Mendoza was killed in the shooting.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births.
His studies showed that giving the hormone accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team had found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and she passed away two months ago, which is a pretty unique case, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted ahead of the 2010 federal election, and the number of opponents of Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Premier Julia Gillard of the Department of Transport and Infrastructure argued that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared her view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
On the extreme end of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed thought that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent thought that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three medley events at the Commonwealth Games, but her condition has been uncertain due to pain.
He has not been able to take the necessary pain-relieving drugs, since their use is forbidden in sports.
On January 25, computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri found the largest prime number ever known.
By early February, many people confirmed the finding with various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the earth was born, since comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year, and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "politically charged and ridiculous".
He's expected to run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that allows planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground-based radar, allowing air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no additional transportation and no overground trains stop at Wembley, and there are no parking and access parking services available at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without any team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species had already developed in two generations, although it was thought that the sequence of events would last much longer, due to cross-breeding between the native Darwin's pear (Geospiza fortes) and the newly introduced cactus (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted picture books called "letterbooks".
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make the measurement yourself using the juice of the redfish.
The colour of the lime juice varies according to the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The number of hydrogen ions (pHnH) in the test chemical indicates the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then crush them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet, connected to a complex sewer system.
The remains of sewerage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Greece, Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had baths, and in Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men bathed simultaneously in the same spaces.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up the call and then reflects it back to you almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket, over 100 feet long.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and moving much easier and faster is the greatest thing that the bicycle has done for us.
It has given us the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them, medium-sized cats eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and parrots.
Then there are many small felines (including free- ranging pet cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, in much larger numbers.
The secret of their success is an ecological locker, a concept that says that each cat has a special job to do, and that's why it doesn't compete with the others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, and they live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and, at times, up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
These animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other large felines), and they too are very dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family of big cats (Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and only these four animals can roar.
The tiger's roar is not a lion's roar of a lion, but more like a phrase made up of hoarse, shouted words.
The Oselot prefers to eat small animals, preying on apes, snakes, rodents, and birds if they catch them, and almost all the animals the Oselot preys on are much smaller than it is.
Researchers believe that the oselots track and locate food, or prey, by the smell of the land they have traveled in.
The Oselots have very good vision in the dark, thanks to their night vision, and they move very inconspicuously, hunting by blending into their environment and then pounding their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it is native (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from what it was before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it gradually begins to look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations become so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is just the creation of a new species, and speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they use carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food by connecting to the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the greatest beast of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were topped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an extra row of teeth in the jaw that prevented any escape.
We're not sure, but it could have had a branching language, a diet of turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't have withstood it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own peculiar or unusual feasts, such as the wild boar, the peacock, the snail, and the rodent called the peanut.
Second, the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, but the rich preferred to have communal meals, where they would sit on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman dining could not serve the kind of food that only came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then the inner sanctuary, or most holy, into which only the priests were allowed to go.
Sometimes temples were built with pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked food in the courtyard, and the stores were nothing more than open-air stalls right on the streets, with stone as the building material.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas, it was said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that as he traveled westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his findings, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The inscription is inverted at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that a large parchment document (measuring 29 3⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches) was originally wrapped on a scroll for safekeeping.
So it is likely that the inscription was simply added as a nameplate.
D-Day, or the landings and subsequent battles, had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was in the hands of the so-called Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders, not fighting them.
The Allied invasion of southern France on August 15, 1944, codenamed Operation Dragoon, was a massive offensive by the Allies against the French.
In just two weeks, American and Free French troops liberated the south of France and turned their attention to Germany.
Civilization is the culture that is shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilian or citizen, and is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also, in a way, defines the size of a society.
The urban states are the predecessors of the nation states. Civilized culture refers to the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a long cultural footprint and a large-scale diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any necessary historical evidence, and so they are not generally considered to be true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only part of it - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judiciary, it had to resort to the often uncooperative state agencies for the enforcement of all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to change tax laws or interstate customs duties.
Amending the articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, and the states were so overwhelmingly opposed to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national team, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller-skating, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in them even in international matches and the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the islands of Japan, Japan is often spoken of as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan was first known in the 15th century when European seafarers sailing past it mentioned the island, calling it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan in 1624, initiating a change in the native peoples' grain-producing methods and hiring Chinese laborers for their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and proclaimed Taiwan a Qing Dynasty province in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common size used in the world for stills is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the era of analog film.
It is still produced, but above all the image sensor formats of the digital camera have inherited its aspect ratio.
A bit confusingly, the size of the 35mm is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Hence, the ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest size ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The oft-abused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple rule of thumb that creates dynamic in the picture while still maintaining some order.
It says that the most effective location for the main subject is where the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the image into thirds cross (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected all, kings as well as common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for just such a use.
The centrality of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question the fulfillment of the doctrine.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, even though the siege violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international treaties over the previous two hundred years.
Britain was laying mines in international waters to block ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the tactic only elicited limited reactions, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine fleet.
In the 1920's, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
The nations ended the horrors and atrocities of World War I in order to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods: Each stage of China, or each ruling family, had its own dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought valiantly for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to gain a seat on the highest seat in the mighty palace of Xi'an.
The social and political consequences were many, including the introduction of the metric system, the transition from an autocracy to a republic, the rise of nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the offices were also opened to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same was true of the military, because military rank was now based on ability rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in the things outside of everyday life, and he often went to meditate in the cave that became known as Hira, located on the mountain of light, called Nur.
The cave itself, left untouched by the ravages of time, gives a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on a mountain ridge north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find even if you know it's there, because once you're inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
With only a clear, beautiful sky above and many mountains surrounding the cave, you see or hear very little of the world below.
The Giza Plain, or Necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small burial chambers, several temples, and the Sphinx of Giza.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid-shaped structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The rising arrow looks like a V, and the descending arrow looks like a square or a square with no bottom line.
The upward bow means that you should start from the bowline and push the bow, and the downward bow means that you should start from the fross (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A rising bow usually produces a softer sound, while a falling bow is stronger and more harsh.
Feel free to add your own notes with a pencil, but remember that the printed punctuation marks are for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of working women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris.
They came back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob, shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At some point, someone in the crowd shook the head of a bodyguard killed in Versailles in front of a shocked queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to pay the war costs of the American imperialism for the occupation of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover a significant portion of the cost and to take care of the interest on the bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of U.S. imperialism, of course, was the enormous profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the background against which the organization was born.
The Middle Ages are the period of European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Medieval Period, and then by the Late Medieval Period, generally considered to have ended about the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term which covers a wide range of ideas, from the driving force of technology, i.e. the necessity of technology, to the absolute view that human destiny is governed by scientific laws and the logic of their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic assumptions: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology in turn has innate rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
For example, one might argue that the invention of the automobile inevitably led to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars leads to more road accidents, which leads to the invention of new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major ingredient in Romanticism, and was borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichten and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography was seen as shaping individuals, and over time, the habits and culture of that geographic location developed, and because they were in harmony with society, they worked better than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100.
Its position was weakened in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the supply of the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak between the end of the 10th and the beginning of the 11th century and the end of the 14th century.
At first, the clothes were strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication routes, Western European styles could be 25-30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the era was the use of buttons to fasten clothing to people, along with the Crusades.
A subsistence farm is a farm that produces enough food to feed only the farmer and his family.
A homestead is a simple, often natural system of farming using seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with rotational farming or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel rejected by the norms of society, and thus are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or the sex of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as its own and distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality related, geographical or a combination of several factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership by way of a style of distinctive and symbolic behaviour, including fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use the example of the few unfortunate children who grew up without adult socialization as a result of neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents), and in some cases, the abandonment has been due to the parents' having abandoned a child with a serious mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are said to be farmed, some said to have lived in their natural habitat.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than man, he will behave (within his physical limitations) in almost the same way as his foster animal, for example, by showing similar fear or indifference toward humans.
The aim of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting, but the idea of 'scaffolding' goes one step further.
The ladder is not a learning method but an aid to support individuals in a new learning experience, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The sticks can be both virtual and real, so the teacher is a kind of a sticker, but so is the little paper clip of Microsoft Office.
Virtual ladders are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, give suggestions and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to do without any help.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but some do.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, consistent education, and reliable health care.
The purpose of placement of children is to address all of the basic conditions they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and human communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add additional dimensions to the purpose theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are suggested as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" as new influential perspectives when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, or facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that by interpreting microfaces it is possible to identify correctly whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two stocks of genetic modification: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, selection removes it from the pool of variations that have emerged.
With each generation, separation and recombination transfer the fluctuation back and forth between these two stocks.
A handful of animals with digestive systems similar to those of humans have difficulty getting enough amino acids from the plants available in the savannah.
And the consequences of not having them are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and legumes, but it's difficult for our kind of mammals to digest them without ripening.
Animal food, on the other hand, (ant, termites, eggs) is easily digested and provides abundant protein containing all the essential amino acids.
So it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate awakening during a normal sleep cycle and re-falling asleep a little later (after 10 to 60 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not awaken completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your dreams, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or a tea known as a diuretic) before going to bed, which forces you to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force, the more complete peace and contentment is possible for all.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but with the addition of the concept of the mahajana, or great path, and many of the techniques of Indian yoga.
In essence, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, including Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga, where the visualization of the deities cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and that's why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated, and after the war, the collision of systems, procedures and cultures led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and war was really fought, for proxy armies fought on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
The Polish defense had already been broken by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered the country and opened the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine by attacking eastern Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that its own country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods while disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was mostly using submarines to try to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and calves.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds, which roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often tended by goatherds, often children or young, such as the better-known sheep herders, a method of herding still in use today.
Chariots were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon roads consisted only of parallel timbers, they enabled the horses to pull the wagons faster and with greater loads than those on the more uneven roads of the day.
Rail poles were used early on to hold tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron rail over them.
The practice became common, but iron consumed more of the carriage's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first full-sized rails were put into use.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the evolution of Homo erectus.
The Australopithecus that preceded it did not walk upright one continuous time.
Bipedal specialization is found in 4.2-3.9-million-year-old fossils of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that is to come.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want to be just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have increased because of overcrowding and mankind's wasteful way of life.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, the handwritten copy, signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were printed, which are now known as the Dunlap Open Arks.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 open-casts of Dunlap known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document; the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like nightmares.
They have legs with fins and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
In practice, all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits  or bits in the computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most definite sign of indoor poisoning is a visible, opened medicine can or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the label for the first-aid instructions for the venom in question.
The term "mites" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term comes from the fact that in ancient times, lice were very common, and lice are insects that are very well adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both the beetle and the caterpillar are nest-dwellers, adapted to living in their host's nest or enclosure.
There are about 400,000 known cases of MS in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the interests of their child.
These couples can, if they wish, make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights to parental care, allowing the other couple to act as the child's parent.
The main purpose of science is to use scientific methods to explain how the world works, and the scientific method guides most of scientific research.
However, it's not just about doing experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greek declined in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The rhythms observed in many bodily structures and behaviors often depend very much on the existence of innate cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, not simply reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to circulate freely for a certain period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The study by Hershey and Chase was one of the most important indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, either with radioactive phosphorus in the DNA in the phage or with radioactive sulphur in the protein in the phage.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Mutations that occur only in the germ cells can be passed on to children, and mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the landscape  including wild flora and fauna.
Examples of activities in the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours and exploring ecosystems.
One example is the visit, study, and photography of the Bornean orangutans.
Each morning, residents of small rural towns drive to work, and others arrive with jobs where they left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supportive of the private car transport system.
Science now suggests that a vast carbon economy has squeezed the biosphere out of the stable state that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society, everyone uses transportation systems, almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail daily, are the transportation planners just incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively uniform way, so traffic flows tend to have a moderately good consistency and can be represented in a rough mathematical way.
To better describe the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in the mapping, design and maintenance of the road.
Insects were the first animals to take flight, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards against their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The sun beetles and sunflowers are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, with over eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at a maximum width of six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water on our planet that flows into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The actual Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids continued to be built from stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest in population.
The Italian language is used by the Vatican in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the people who work in the State also speak Italian in their vernacular, but Latin is often used in religious services.
All inhabitants of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they all occur naturally and because they are also relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter - in the same order, solid, liquid, gas and plasma - but he also theorized that they change into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are metals like gold and silver.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that they would fit into the end of this sentence by the trillions.
And so the pencil was a good friend to many when it first came on the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing styles have developed, the value and uses of the pencil have been neglected.
Now, when you're writing a message, you're writing it on a computer screen, and you never have to sharpen the sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The principle of the fission atom is that it requires energy to form a nucleus, which is made up of many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart upwards, and then splitting the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which makes them prone to break apart with little or no pressure.
The moon's surface is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called its crust.
The moon's crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the side visible from the earth and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
The dark areas of the sea may be more on the visible side because the shell is thinner, and the lava was easier to surface.
Content theories are primarily concerned with what is behind people's behavior or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When managers start to lead their former peers, two different behavioural patterns can generally emerge: at the other end of the scale, the attempt to remain 'one of the guys' (or 'the guys').
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the person is transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything that the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behaviour often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same quality level as traditional teams but with subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team act as the direct contact for their physical team.
They often have more decision-making power than the regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones and their local management may not always understand this.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which all members report, and the invisible team determines the level of demand each member has.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in all departments operating in an organisation, creativity and inventiveness can be generated.
As a result, a process where the organization works together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and therefore narrows the field of study and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting the scientists' research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies is opening up the possibility of seeing and studying brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This will give us a lot of data and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of information technology that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is the attempt to make machines perform automatically tasks that require intelligent action.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and hand, voice and face recognition.
These have become distinct schools of thought, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and defense, just as it is embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Class trips are an important part of teaching, and oftentimes, a teacher would like to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution: virtual class trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting at a desk.
Sharing a class trip virtually is a great way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills.In the early stages of a student's blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often sloppy, but the presence of an audience usually changes the situation.
Since students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to work hard to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better understand the world around them". The need to feed the interest of the readership inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical, and by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and bring forward their own perspective on the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital, with a wealth of art galleries and museums presenting Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, among other places, is the pristine, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other factors make Ontario seem like a place that outsiders consider to be Canada's heritage.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabitable wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than in all of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest of these and is as much a part of nature as its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France, and they are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, and it gained a lot of traction in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women  All female travellers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual civil status.
Wearing a ring will also help (as long as it does not look too valuable).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment, and it is not unusual for someone to follow you, to take your arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to take sides (cultural differences do not justify sexual intimacy!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber traders, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established a trading post there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
In the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, clayware, leather goods, water pipes and broad-brimmed rugs, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but any excursions outside the city require preliminary investigations into the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu region to determine the current state of affairs.
The city is also the starting point for the climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano, and is home to some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-bodaa (motorcycle taxi).
Combined with its comparatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city in decline, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 because of the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Louis Henry Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arabs than Africans.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature reserves, each of which supports a variety of fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's premier attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a daily conservation and admission fee, as do all South African national parks.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the region of Hong Kong and is a major destination for many tourists.
The contours of the buildings that form the silhouette of Hong Kong are compared to the shimmering pattern of pillars that is best reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are from the island and across the harbor area of Kowloon.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on the north shore in a landfill built on the landfill.
This is the exact spot that the British colonial masters took over, and if you're looking for clues to the area's colonial history, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching for 50 miles [80 km] from the coast of Bangladesh to the backwaters of India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Indian part of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangroves. They are some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about a third of which is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and some 30,000 axis-tailed deer.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta and Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the local buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the county is served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are nice and supportive.
Kimppataksis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paroon (150 Nultrumi) and Punakhaan (200 Nultrumi).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m], it is 1,900 feet [378 m] long, and it has two 12-foot [3.5 m] wide strips.
The bridge has a main span of 15 metres and was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian border stations are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important of the indigenous groups inhabiting the area of present-day eastern Paraguay, living partly as nomadic hunters but also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes, such as the guaycurú and the payaguá, who made their living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Kingdom of the Indians", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples of the country in the 16th century.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted 300 years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best pool teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Ground.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
The Argentine Polo Association provides news of tournaments and tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is the main currency of the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often used in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the Outer Islands, although British and U.S. currencies may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands themselves, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere, while it is winter in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone, and temperatures of over 90 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common during the summer months.
Winter can be tricky: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no special rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain falls is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife.
Buffalo, deer, bear, and almost any large animal can attack, even though they may look very tame.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
Also, consider that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing strong- smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships - German, American, and British - refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
A peaceful gathering in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement led to the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of sandy beaches because Auckland is situated between two ports, and the most popular ones are in three different areas.
The North Shore (North Harbor) beaches are on the Pacific coast, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and the pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the harbour of Waitemata at Mission Bay and St Heliers in the affluent suburb of Central Auckland.
They are sometimes busy family residences, and the shoreline is lined with a good selection of shops.
The most important local beer is "Number One", which is not a multi-dimensional beer, but a pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are several French wines worth tasting, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved on the way.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but the cautious will easily find bottled water.
The idea of a flat white type of milk coffee is foreign to Australians. The small black coffee is known as espresso, and the cappuccino is served with a large amount of cream-based milk instead of the foamed milk. The tea is served without milk.
The cacao is of Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
The reef is a year-round destination for many trips, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
So heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cube-shaped medusa is found north of 1770 in the vicinity of beaches and river banks from October to April, and occasionally at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most are afraid of humans and will probably swim away.
The great white crocodile does not actually live in the sea, but its primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, a traveler has the peace of mind that, when he reaches his destination, he will have some place to sleep.
Travel agencies often offer accommodation in certain hotels, but it may be possible to make reservations for other types of accommodation, such as camping, through the travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation in force if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your purpose.
However, all changes and requests should be first directed through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees choose to camp in the area, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be there in time to get the music close to the campsite.
Remember, even after the main stage music shows have ended, there may be places at festivals where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea during the winter, check the location of the cabin, because the worst parts of the ice make a very terrible noise.
The cruise in St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city, and cruise passengers are exempted from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in good spirits  and on the casino premises.
Some places offer alcohol on a house-to-house basis, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain slopes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or very cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on tarmac.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that the car gets stuck.
Snow or snow blown by the wind, and moisture or ice on the windows of the vehicle, can also reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is generally operated without interruption throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps Africa's biggest draw and, for many, the highlight of a visit.
In common parlance, the word safari refers to a journey by land to observe Africa's magnificent wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come near cars, and ordinary equipment is well suited to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, trekking safari, and hiking) is a trekking trip that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation practices vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellation practices will not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost ¥2,500 to ¥1,300,000, with tickets normally costing ¥7,000.
Rubbing wet clothes can help them dry, and many hotels offer the possibility of borrowing an iron and a board, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you are not particularly fond of having your socks ironed, you may try a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, fraying).
There are different ways of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their home region.
The pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread toxins, and spread disease.
Serious infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can violently harm or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means the possibility of buying products in certain places which are exempt from excise and sales taxes.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, as it repeatedly passes through remote forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are many steep climbs and descents, narrow lanes and steep turns.
The speed limits imposed are considerably lower than those on earlier and later routes  generally 3540 miles per hour (5664 kilometres per hour)  and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Strangely, mobile phone connectivity is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are very good and in Bavaria they are very tasty and versatile, reminiscent of the pastries of Austria, the country to the south.
Fruit pies are common, apple pies are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German leivonnettes also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you crave small but firm pastries, try one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, either with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland areas of north-east India and Pakistan commonly use yogurt in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a superlative that covers a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But when used without further specifications, it usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, and includes a wide range of simply flavored dishes. Javanese favorites include peanuts, chiles, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The legs are the rider's legs, which are suspended on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they may be associated with safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse's back and his foot gets caught in the railing, the escaping horse may try to pull him back.
First, most riders wear a curled riding boot with a smooth and fairly narrow bottom.
Some, especially English, have a saddle that allows the harness to be pulled backward by a falling rider.
The valley of Cochamón is the number one climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, and is characterized by a variety of large granite walls and rock formations.
The views from the summits are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world continue to forge new routes to its endless walls.
The skiing and snowboarding sports are popular sports in which snowboards are lowered from the ground by means of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many skiers, sometimes called ski-pugs, plan entire vacations at a particular destination around skiing.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers have been made as far back as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking: this activity is also called pack skiing, skiing or skiing excursion.
It is related to ski-style trekking or mountain-climbing, but does not usually include such activities, since the latter are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and poles.
Think of the ski trail as a kind of hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can go somewhat faster than on foot, but you rarely reach the speed you would on a skiing platform without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries.In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean filling in visa applications and passing passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area acts in this respect somewhat like a single state.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without re-passport control.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what factory-made goods are antiques, but some tax authorities define all goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies according to geographical location, for example in North America, antiques are considered to be more recent than in Europe. 
Handicrafts may be classified as antiques even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
The Saami people make a living from the pork industry, and the culture associated with it is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but have lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, and have mainly relied on reindeer as a source of income.
Today, many Sami people work in modern occupations, and tourism is an important source of income in Saami.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive, because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country of visit is included in the travel information, this may affect your travel medical insurance and your travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps it is worth seeking advice from other states besides your own, even though their advice is for their own citizens.
For example, Americans may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The bulletins are just brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, generalized, and oversimplified in comparison with more detailed information available elsewhere.
Hazardous weather is a generic term for all hazardous weather events that may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Hazardous weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of hazardous weather, depending on geography, landforms and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, heavy rain, heavy rainfall and wildfires are forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather events include blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of hazardous weather affecting destinations, as it may affect travel plans.
All those wishing to visit a country that could be interpreted as a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely yield the address of a local business.
The course usually covers all the subjects covered in much more detail and is usually combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning to have a sex reassignment operation abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of the authorities to issue passports without an X or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who haven't had surgery shouldn't assume they'll survive security scans while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Back currents are the return of waves that break on the shore, often found at reefs or similar places.
Because of the underwater surface features, the backflow concentrates to a few deeper parts, where a fast flow into deep water can be formed.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the water, swimming back in isn't any harder than it used to be.
Try to head for somewhere where you won't be swept away again, or depending on your skills and whether you're spotted, it might be wise to wait for rescuers.
Returning shock strikes earlier than culture shock (the induction phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For tourists who have had no difficulty adjusting to a new culture, adjusting to their home culture can be especially difficult.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your home culture customs.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
What people may not realize is that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children to see in the area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show begins, they can be seen in complete silence.
Usually, you hear the voices of travelers and merchants, and the story of light and sound is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is the background of a long story and the narrator.
The scenes are set against the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Many nations have claimed the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases.
The largest is King George Island, which is home to the centre of the Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where a crater of a still-active volcano filled with water serves as a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea on the southern end of the peninsula.
There the mountains of the plain merge and then rise again to form the 200-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Mountains, which are split by the glacier of Minnesota.
In the north, the Sentinel Mountains are home to the highest mountains in the Antarctic, the Vinson Range, with its highest peak, Mount Vinson, at 14,925 feet [4,892 m].
In remote areas where cell phone coverage is limited, satellite telephony may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, since to make a call you must be outside and maintain unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is used frequently by maritime, leisure and excursion groups requiring remote data and voice connections. 
Your local telephone service provider will probably be able to provide you with more information on connecting to that service.
Travel and learning is becoming a popular option for those planning a gap year.
It is especially popular among high school graduates because they can take a year off before college without having their education suffer.
In many cases, attending a year-long course abroad can even improve the chances of continuing higher education in your home country.
Typically, participation in these teaching programmes is subject to a fee.
Finland is a great destination for boating, and in the land of thousands of lakes there are also thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal islands.
On islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a boat the size of a cat.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where boats are found in every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. in the Netherlands it is one in 40).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return to the ship for the night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you are visiting the country only on excursions organised by a ship (as of 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany, and as you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or had any traumatic experience.
It is not to be ashamed of; it is no different from the fears and dislike of many other people for some other things.
For some, some understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during flight may help to overcome the fear of ignorance or a feeling of helplessness.
Transport companies are well paid for fast delivery, and oftentimes speed is very important for companies' documents, merchandise or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
The larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they were shipping goods by air, unloading and clearing could take days on some routes.
The only way to get the goods through faster was to send it as checked baggage, which is against airline regulations, which means you're needed at this point.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large chunk of money for this privilege (or perhaps you'd rather let your firm do it for you).
But it's not cheap: the hard-fought rule of thumb is that you can expect to pay up to four times the price of business class compared to economy class and eleven times the price of first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it is generally not worth even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of airline passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the declaration of independence in 1994 of the Transnistrian Republic, located in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
The economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port in the country after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, prosperous, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by mountains and spread out around a huge bay.
The city is a melting pot of leafy boulevards, glass-topped buildings and modern shopping centres, with traditional red-brick roofs, an 18th-century marketplace and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.
Haldarsvík has an unusual octagonal church, and the village offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy.
The church has interesting carvings of doves on some of the tombstones.
You should spend half an hour exploring this fascinating village.
From there, to the north and within easy reach, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which foreigners will learn to know from Lord Byron's eulogy in which he described its splendor.
Bus 403 runs regularly from ScottUrb to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can also visit the large shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, world-famous for her apparitions.
Remember that you are practically visiting a mass grave and a site that has an almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the people of the earth.
Many men and women who survived there are still alive, and many others whose loved ones were murdered there or were forced to hang themselves there, Jews and Gentiles alike.
And remember, treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and don't make fun of the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't ruin the place by drawing or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, but about half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most understand it, and virtually all speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only marked in Catalan, since it is the first official language by law.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
The Metro's regular alarms are only in Catalan, but the automatic system notifies of unexpected disturbances in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although often a mere misplaced stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is to be as decent as possible and to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred), which makes getting around much easier.
The rude exterior of Parisians quickly fades if you give them a simple compliment.
Plitvice National Park is heavily forested, mainly with pine, beech and pine trees, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide range of plant communities due to the variety of microclimates, varying soil and altitude.
The area also boasts an extraordinary variety of animal and bird species.
Along with more common species, you can see rare fauna, such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, hippopotamuses, wild cats, and meadows
Women visiting monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees, and shoulders must also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially one of bright colors, you may get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to wear trousers that reach below the knee.
You can borrow these from the entryway wardrobe, but they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Like similar cuisines in the Mediterranean, the Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, roasts and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb was: bread with olive oil and tomatoes and any available additive, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and especially the word "you", always begin with an uppercase, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although writing is complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantiated form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G are the ones to be paid the most attention to, since their pronunciation depends on the next vowel.
And also, remember, the r and the r are pronounced differently.
Persian grammar is fairly easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you learn many things about Persian grammar and improve your comprehension of sentences.
Needless to say, if you know some Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier.
Yet, those who have little knowledge of Spanish may suddenly imagine that Portuguese is so close that it need not be studied separately.
Today, old-fashioned observatories are generally not used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations, and they are located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese apricot.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom parties exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy who worked in the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" sample.
If you go into a formal and well-maintained garden, you will fly out of the "sample" collection without any trouble.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it is very easy to find your way there.
But in the heart of the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both heat (always) and intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
In addition, a bus or two will take you north to Hebron, where tradition has it that the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives are buried.
Make sure that the bus you are about to board also goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to the charming towns along the Danube or sailing on the Eire Canal.
They also govern the routes of popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated on the birthday of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with the celebration have been adopted by non-Christians and non-Christians throughout the world.
Traditionally, Easter is celebrated by staying awake in some open space to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often celebrate the Mass of the Paschal Night on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, and the congregation often bursts into celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island came by swimming, flying or hovering.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, the mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the principal herbivore of the Galapagos Islands.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the "Camos", when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It provides a good opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky is dark almost round the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may have been accustomed to.
Clothes are commonplace, and colleagues call each other by surname or title.
The emphasis on teamwork rather than individual achievements is crucial.
Often, employees must have the approval of their supervisor for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the supervisor's instructions without fail.
