The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative fall.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from its losses.
The transactions in CEZ shares accounted for almost half of the current daily trading volume.
Since early Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the day before's collapse where it was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the stock market crash on Wall Street.
So, too, we have a market reaction to the result of the vote in the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
The collapse of Asian stocks
Asian stock markets fell sharply on Tuesday, though indexes later in the day wiped some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cleared almost 4%, but later also some of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% as markets in Shanghai closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange was losing more than 5%, but in the end the losses settled at 4.3%.
Thay-Wan's stock market, according to the local index, has fallen 3.6%.
"The planning of the bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world", noted Hong Kong's chief currency officer Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it is independent of the central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
US lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the financial support proposal.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer.
Slaughter of American Actions
The US Congress on Monday rejected a financial system bailout plan that was to provide $700 billion.
The lawmakers thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a slaughter Monday, and major stock indexes posted their biggest crash in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7%, and a similar fall was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the US government can give 700 billion dollars to the banks.
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an economic support agreement for the US financial system.
The vote on this will be early next week.
US lawmakers broke the ice in the talks on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid to the US financial system totalling $700 million.
But it's not yet known.
Representatives of the Congress must therefore define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported by the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, on Sunday.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
Economists believe that the announcement of the financial plan should be the first and most important psychological factor to awaken financial markets.
But then we will have to go back to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, market support is achieved.
The plan must be effective.
"We've made a big step forward".
"We have clarified our differences of opinion on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package", Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers' delegates met Saturday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government's financials.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses for financial companies and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
"We have reached final agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market".
"We still need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we are there", said Paulson.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is having a severe impact on the stock markets, which are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the Asian financial markets trade, which are, in chronological order, the first to affect the market on Monday following the Congress' decision.
But it's not clear when the two houses of Congress will vote on the bill, or if negotiations will be held up at the last minute.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount of support for the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the remainder of the money if it feels the program is not doing its job, by blocking the next $100 billion and then the final $350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
While the President can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program has remained, namely to get the financing to buy passive mortgage securities, whose price has plummeted because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", as the Republican senator mentioned.
The progress in the negotiations is also welcomed by US President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's positive development and appreciated "both parties' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead spokesman, said lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial plan, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget on cuts, splitting the financial plan.
The new law also aims to limit so-called golden parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee to oversee the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a big step forward towards an agreement that will work and will be beneficial for the market and also for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan is to help homeowners who have trouble paying their bills.
The government should negotiate new mortgage installments that it will buy with the goal of lowering the monthly installment fees for borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses are shared between the financial sector and the government", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not so crucial, according to Marek.
"Most importantly, congressional representatives should reach agreement this week on support for this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important now", Marek stressed.
Duel to the death: MP3 players versus cell phones
We'll advise you on how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
This clearly shows that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons for getting a self-help reader.
The choice depends entirely on the use and needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Firstly, these music products are not released as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if you have hard rock, jazz, blues vinyls on your shelves, you probably dream of a record player like that.
It also works with portable music, which is music that is compressed or simply in MP3 format.
Here too, there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to digest the 20 crown headphones on the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
There's a lot to choose from.
It's the battery life that counts.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply read music, but that is not something that cell phones do even by accident.
There is no other device today as universal as the mobile phone.
Besides the primary functions of calling and texting, it can read music and video, record both, and it has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse, and maybe it can even surf.
And if you take smartphones and handhelds into account, you'll also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the sooner the indicator on the screen will ask for the charger.
And reading music takes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap cell phones, do not count on them lasting more than a few hours.
If you still occasionally make a few calls, get another charger at work for safety, even for the most expensive appliances.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least nine hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto the memory card, but few memory readers can do without a mini-card adapter that is not used in cell phones.
Readers, with a few exceptions (iPods) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create a multimedia library of their own, sorted by artist name, album name, genre, or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you should be especially concerned with battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output, and clearly ease of use.
If you need music mainly as background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you need just any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Now, that's obviously on any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what formats your cell phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support all of them, so the global majority of music that comes to you will be in this very format.
In addition to this format, which is among the most common, the vast majority of devices support music in WMA format.
The AAC format used by Apple and its iPods is less common.
The better cell phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile internet network and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile phone reader.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is meagre and usually limited to the hits of the radio moment.
The prices aren't really that low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones with them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something, they can go through their pockets while their MP3 player is left at home.
But it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your wireless earpiece.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small fraction of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of mobile phone readers is, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you can buy a very decent walkman.
Usually, though, you'll be limited by the absence of an entry for common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones, even with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The advantage of the readers is, among other things, their easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) and can be handled by anyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally triggering the start-up of the mobile internet network and consequently a huge data bill.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
The purchase of the respective card is also included in the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the more expensive ones can even handle 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, you can get Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are a demanding listener, you may want to pick up a specialized mobile phone - a walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service so it comes close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more progress, as the mobile phones in the Walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above brands provide the same service and price category up to 4 000 SEK, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, in principle up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe I did .
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all the services of their Western European partners.
However, something is missing here  a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be gone long.
We have already written many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
In the end, ČTÚ confirmed this, noting that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges may create a paradoxical situation - for some Czech mobile phone customers, SMS will be cheaper abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to start the fight.
This may sound absurd, but here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has often stressed this, having said in the past that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably no longer has many possibilities.
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the market led to a significant price decrease, which would have had to be met by traditional operators.
At the same time, even before the arrival of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in Britain.
But it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be really successful.
In the end, we don't have to go very far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, to which U:fon belongs in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In other words, it needs far fewer customers than a traditional operator to operate effectively.
They do not entail relatively high costs for setting up, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
So in the world of virtual operators they usually come in low cost, offer low cost calls and SMS, which is often balanced with the more restricted service offerings.
So for example Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that costs at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even betting on a target group can be a pretty good move.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operators they like and trust", says David Seibertz CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be applied here as in Poland.
The Commission notes that the Czech Republic has not yet adopted a decision on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
In addition, from the point of view of services, it is relatively saturated".
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there ever is an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk of expanding this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very hopeful.
The start-up of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our region", Jana Studničková, the press spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone conversation with Mobile.cz.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favourable to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, it has been keen to launch a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them", says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
So maybe better times are coming.
We're getting unofficial reports that the first virtual operator should be here by the end of the year.
But for now, an impenetrable wall of silence stands around his creation.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no one with a complex and serious project has approached us", said Vlastimil Sršeň of Telefónica O2's press office in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificities of the Czech market are also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far we have not noticed any vital and mutually beneficial commercial project on which it is possible to continue to build".
He adds: "It is unlikely that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network before the end of the year.
We should have had a concrete agreement on the table by now, so that it could be considered on the horizon.'
Vodafone is focusing its attention rather on meeting its 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for high-speed mobile internet.'
Competent authorities - with accomplices
The attitude of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The troubles surrounding the creation of U:fon testify that when operators care about something they know how to row in the same direction.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressing on ČTÚ in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from ČTÚ's web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been further enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on it and especially on its services.'
The attitude of mobile operators is, however, quite surprising given the complete disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not just the attitude of the CTU that is at issue, unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - it has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That is the exclusive responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position on the whole issue.
'The virtual operator would be able to enter the mobile telephony market after the necessary infrastructure lease agreement between the mobile operator and the virtual operator had been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer from potential buyers was probably not attractive enough for traditional operators,' said Kristián Chalupa, from the ÚOHS External Relations Section, in response to our question.
This statement by the operators' representatives is perhaps not surprising.
But the fact that the Office must defend the interests of consumers and also ensure that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators are commonly operating, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services".
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices are not in ÚOHS' interests.
What is really shocking about the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence, it arises by itself.
The same price for petrol for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competition.
'The Chamber has found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position and therefore no correspondingly greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The telecommunications regulator may also lack the necessary tools to open up the mobile network market to virtual operators", Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of the many controversial issues .
There is of course the relevant market analysis by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different approach - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has - logically - a monopoly on its network.
So for a certain portion, it has to be dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least alarming to ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the above-mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all operators.
To shift responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly common trick with which ÚOHS keeps itself out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not until the recently adopted update of the Telecommunications Act that the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was promoted, despite the fact that many experts expected this to improve the situation.
The representatives of ÚOHS must know this well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
You can do it when no one's looking.
We are not aware of the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist on Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephony services, but these are only partially public.
Usually these are companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the people who are pre-selected.
The magic is that the company is seen by the operator as a typical business customer, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, you then receive special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
'If the cases you are talking about, which we will be looking into, did occur, it could be a breach of contract and could lead to the termination of cooperation with this company,' Martina Kemrová answered the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of the operators responsible for mobile telephony.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time against such an attitude.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations to the Council on the application of the principle of subsidiarity.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully use it as regular customers of mobile operators.
But that should be the least of the oddities at the CTU.
In addition, another question is raised for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators are blind to this attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It must be added that ÚOHS has a strong enough right to expose similar activities and if it does not want to, it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not expensive anymore
As has been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small a market, too saturated at the border, problems with quality of service, etc.
But in developed countries, it is precisely in these cases that regulators have stepped in to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and others joined him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case at each other like a boiling potato.
In our experience we cannot escape the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes them more than comfortable.
But we're not giving up.
If the information from the backstage is correct and the virtual operator will appear very soon, the Czech mobile phone market will get back on track.
If one operator had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, ÚOHS could hardly remain unmoved by the refusal (discrimination) of the other operators concerned.
And maybe we'll stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On the occasion of the Czech Statehood Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on Sunday solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available  solo with male or female voice, choral step and instrumental edition.
The singing is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the website iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told the radio station "Český rozhlas" earlier that he specifically chose to sing the solo variants, singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to make sure that both of them and the choir had clear diction, that the text was understandable, that they were in harmony", he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously embraced it.
The first stanza of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
MHD Prague Wednesday will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, tram and buses, who will have an electronic card in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
Right now , about 100,000 people can get it with their own Opencard .
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual (valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their card reloaded at the Infopoints and the offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stops.
The vouchers can be purchased online from yesterday at the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers had taken advantage of the service by the afternoon.
Those who start using the service via the internet can completely forget about the desks at the metro stops where they had to wait in long lines for paper tickets.
The voucher is purchased online and is recharged on the Opencard at one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these places, passengers have a trained desk that will help them with their online purchases and will also record the credit they have acquired on their card", said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic vouchers to Opencards at ATMs and self-service machines that are installed at the entrances to the metro.
What are these ATMs like?
They are red, resemble ticket wipers, and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be 80", concluded Opatrný.
The receipt will be checked by the ATM instead of the driver.
The ATM service that will be operational from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after you pay the coupon, it will load on top.
The electronic cards will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the urban lines of trains and buses numbered 300 to 499, which residents of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"On trains added to Prague's integrated transport, there are controllers with card readers to check the time and zone validity", explained Filip, a ticket controller from the organisation Ropid, which sets the timetables for Prague's public transport.
City buses have card readers built into the driver's trunk.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to rest the Opencard on the point determined next to the cash register.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information", Drápal added.
Passengers who take city buses and will not remember when the voucher expires can go back to the self-service ATMs, where the vouchers are loaded onto paper.
Here information on the validity of their documents will be displayed on the device's screen.
Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is stated in the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
It is with this desire, it is said, that groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is shown above all by the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Sumava district"  occupied by Hitler under the Munich Agreement  to Czechoslovakia again.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter signed with the words "The people who care about the fate of Šumava with all their heart" reads.
Since, they say, annexation by Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - gives the Sudeten Germans only hope of brutality, lack of consideration, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the letter's authors beg the American president to take over the protectorate over Šumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the Allied victory", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president were to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Šumava, all he would need to do is hold a referendum in the district on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the US or live under US rule.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive given our knowledge of postwar history, according to some witnesses it aptly describes the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the German Czechs should have had a slight sense that this would be their move from the republic, few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German from Budějovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in the prison camp at Holštýn, dozens of other German Czechs came to visit him to learn Czech.
"They thought that once they got home, the Czech language would be useful", Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him counted on the fact that on the basis of Beneš' decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This is also how one might describe the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček, hopes this will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The 150 million campaign will be shown on television, radio, cinema, the internet and on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol.
And remind him to fasten his seat belt before he leaves.
It is aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and professional drivers.
What's going to be in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect your emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the slogan "bloody" throughout the campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is in capital letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you will pay".
This should symbolize that a person can pay with his life in a moment of distraction.
The commercials will scare viewers into 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images of dramatic scenes of accident victims are common.
This promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to the drivers
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is, for example, when they run red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risk", says Martin Kořán, a psychologist at the Ministry of Transport and Hospital Na Homolce.
And so we need press campaigns and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
He feels that the warning signs are already less effective.
"If the fixed danger sign is installed, it will probably soon blend in with the environment and drivers will not pay attention to it", warns Kořán.
Olmert would return most of the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The Prime Minister of the Israeli Provisional Government, Ehud Olmert, has expressed his support for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue published on Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we must leave the Palestinians the same percentage (of Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would include East Jerusalem .
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want to be hit by the raptors or the lawnmowers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the premier, it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical sites", which are inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he added.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered to be the essential condition for concluding this peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing a peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They must abandon their current relationship with Iran; they must abandon their relationship with Hezbollah; they must abandon the permanent support they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, Al-Qaeda and Jihad in Iraq", the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: are stewards on buses illegal?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus of the company Student Agency, the question arose whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the law strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the traffic law", says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week's accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant was caused by a truck cutting into the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the least secure seat on the bus at the time, even though there were still two other seats available.
But the bus can crash or brake abruptly even when it is handing out coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus has standing facilities according to the traffic register.
If not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The buses of the Student Agency have no stopping places, the company's director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálnĕ.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry and at first they did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
It was later repealed and we concluded that passengers can use the toilet during the flight if they have their seat allocated", he said.
The law doesn't recognize stewards.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role  no law deals with regularization of this role".
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The traffic law only recognizes the term vehicle companion, its rights and duties are not defined", adds spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
The Director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law takes care of this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing seats.
That's it", he says.
It categorises buses into urban where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, long distance buses with standing places with the highest maximum speed and long distance buses without standing places with the maximum speed allowed and seats fitted with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are few dangers during a quiet run, the situation can be compared to airline service.
It's not safe there either when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head".
"If the bus brakes abruptly, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like on the city bus or the tram.
The carrier must solve the steward's safety with an internal regulation", he says, and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transportation company that offers steward services.
This one employs about two hundred.
The manager still thinks their job is dangerous.
"As soon as I feel I must consider the steward profession a dangerous occupation, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
They would also reduce costs", he says.
Asiana's manager Alexei Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, justified the absence of stewards on his vehicles as a concern for safety.
"We have no hostess, we have been opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There's been a terrible tragedy.
In the accident on the Naples line, a young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably went out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid him with a sudden maneuver, but he hit him with his right front.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest were occupied.
"You can't reserve these seats on long-distance buses, they're unusable".
The company is planning to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court's ruling to pay damages to the girl's family, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The law review?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, which has been the subject of a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport for more than a year, could lead to a more precise definition of the movement of stewards on board buses.
"They have not achieved any concrete results though.
They don't think so much about buses, they think more about the scoring system, maximum speed on the motorway and mobile phone use while driving", says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the steward's activity to be a major threat to passenger safety", concludes spokesman Havelka, who says police and safety offices are responsible for bus safety.
Düsseldorf's hopes are on Frankfurt
There are words in the letter from the director of WestLB to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday, it was suggested that the "capital market centre of the financial group of savings banks" could be formed through the unit meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a 'competent block' with lasting profits in such a venture.
The whole of this union could also be a decisive impetus for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
That is how it is read when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate its capacity for action.
Because the distressed WestLB is still under great pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, which has long ago pointed out to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out to find a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the customers of the savings banks themselves already know because of their investment funds, and WestLB have certainly been discussed for some time, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, when presenting the turnover for the first half of the year, Deka-Bank's head Franz Waas said that a merger of the Main Street house with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB made no sense.
However, the Deka board of directors, half of whom are regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated to the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
This could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the talks have, as they say in the business world, just begun.
Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important businesses in Frankfurt, and this is not the first time it has been mentioned when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it appeared for a short period that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This three-way association was not done.
As soon as the plans were published, the regional bank of Hesse opposed Helaba's participation.
The other two institutions have also proved unable to reach agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about merging Deka-Bank with regional banks.
However, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba's board of directors, eventually spoke out against designing games to reunite with his house.
Apart from that, it seems to create awareness that it is necessary for the different houses of the public sector to come together.
As the Bavarian parliamentary election has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank may take place first.
That's not exactly good news for Helaba.
If the pressure builds for more mergers, we'll run out of partners.
In the South, there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has weathered the financial crisis much better than houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of the Hesse-Thuringia savings banks, which owns 85% of Helaba, has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic rationale is just one account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual households are combined.
In June Merl pointed out that the decisive question of what business model would ensure the future of regional banks had not yet been answered by the association of German savings banks.
The division of WestLB could also come out eventually, which is of course not desirable on the part of WestLB.
The letter from the Board of Directors thus expresses the desire to seek a 'general solution' in any case.
We shall see how the reunification of the individual parts with Deka-Bank works.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or fourth.
This time Elena is at the party as a companion, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser 5-litre barrel, stands a massive bearded man, showing the 200 or so travelers the deep tones he can produce from his throat.
Elena gives Luca a pat first and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus station next to Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart tonight at 11:45pm for Munich, Festa della Birra", arrival scheduled for 6:30.
Three couriers are mostly Italian, while another is Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated through the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, it's not Italian.
Marco wearing a long coat with a false fur coat and a pair of glasses with silver wide bars belong to him buses.
They've been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year.
I go out at night, I go to the party during the day, I come back at 10:30.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the journey, the welcome toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian authenticity standards, the sickness fund and the German guide.
And so at night the buses leave for Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly, the bus is quiet, the passengers are asleep.
Better so, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian-plate buses on the A9 motorway before Munich make a short stop.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6.30 a.m. as planned, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
One, put on the yellow hat.
On the left side of the card is the word "Oktoberfest" next to the website of Marco's travel agency: "Kennerssiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent, it means running!", quotes Marco in the early morning.
"Run!" Run and take your seats at the back of the tent.
"Not in front, or we'll block, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, split in adjacent space!"
The bottle costs 8.25 euros, shouts Marco.
And don't forget to tip him.
"To show the security service that we're behaving well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third, "Tonight at 10.30 sharp, we meet again here!
We're already leaving for the party.
On the street, you follow the yellow hats to the trees, the road signs and even a billboard of a major Bavarian people's party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the festival, known as "Italian weekend".
The exact figures are not available, but we are talking about 50,000 who set off to cross the Alps and invade the tents, and it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police in Munich are reinforced with 7 officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which does a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians are in first place with 200 medical care ahead of the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially beloved by Italians is the Hofbräuhaus tent.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word 'relative' and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared critical developments.
Because the crisis started this weekend.
DAX-listed mortgage lender Hypo Real Estate is taking out a multi-billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turmoil.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the support credits would amount to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the claimed portion.
THE money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the state lender has refinanced itself in a very short time  which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had fallen by 95% to EUR 2,37 million, and its equity ratio also decreased from 1,6 to 1,45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions were down to zero compared with last year, and earnings from increases in both claims and certain shares and the settlement of provisions on loans fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from the reimbursement of subordinated compensation costs, which came from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest under the single text of the tax laws and from the management of business by business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate at around 16%.
The former public lender, after being privatised in 1990, had become lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were incorporated into the Aareal Bank.
As the income from traditional state funding was too low, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private and state-invested projects (PPPs) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write down the value of the subsidiary, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been wiped out.
In 2007, they had already been reduced by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is a major state and infrastructure financer after the absorption of Depfa.
It is more dependent on market-based interbank refinancing than other institutions, because it has no customer deposits.
The collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago has largely dried up lending between banks, as banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs to borrow some EUR 50 billion annually in the short term for a part of Depfa's loan portfolio.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs were covered by the loan for a certain period and the company was protected from the influence of the mostly non-functioning international money markets.
Other sources say that the money is ensuring the refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE's chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group would not need money markets anytime soon.
The Bundesbank and the BaFin rely on the fact that the HRE Group's marketable position is still assured.
This is hoped for the bank's shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the unbalanced nature of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The financing may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also possible.
After Sunday night the bank was told it was about to fail, the temporary bailout failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price plunged 75% to 3.30 euros.
They're holding up the mortgage rates pretty well.
While the debt of the first degree is almost unmovable, the deferred credit rates are being disbursed.
The loans of the affiliate Württemberg-Hypo are mainly affected, including, of course, those due after 2009.
The HRE loans were formerly seen as a speculative alternative investment, but now, after the crisis in the banks and the institution itself, which the DePfa has said has caused the crisis, has intensified, their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the least affected central banks, governments and banks are still ready, the annuities can be depreciated on time.
Or it starts working, which nobody dares hope will be done in the next 15 months.
But as for the information that has been turned upside down by partial nationalizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will create, above all, for long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the carry-over of losses for future capital gains tax payments.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is supposed to report to Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from the manga in the new exchange log of Japan's story.
First day of school in Japan
I was so excited.
I didn't even care about school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo on the way to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to reach Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, and luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first lesson does not seem to have been set as well as we do in Lower Saxony.
Students arrive gradually from 8 a.m. onward, until at 8:40 a.m. a brief interview with the teacher begins, the so-called "home room".
But before class started, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have my school uniform, I put on an old host mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat down in front of the chair and tried to pronounce it correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and I'm celebrating my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and waved, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I've seen this one in my manga.
It's part of the Japanese girls' vocabulary for survival and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my seat.
The girl next to me chuckled, she was honored to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class went on quietly, but when the gong rang, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking in a messy way and giggling and bothering me with questions  and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother even made me a lunch basket-- it's different from boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meatballs with tofu.
I don't even know what I eat in Japan, to be honest.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Except maybe the salted plums, brrr!
Bento is not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a homemade Bento, quite artistically prepared, in the hope of meeting the boy during recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm just curious if I can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I've been reading the manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, I eventually started to learn a little Japanese.
I was totally convinced I was gonna come once.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care about us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - on the other hand, Japan is strict, disciplined and traditional.
Because everything is well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life".
1. Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach runs away when they feel danger.
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
4. But how might it be if, when they behave in the same way as we do, they have the same feelings as we do?
The Internet newspaper "Edge" has been publishing articles by well-known scientists for some years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you believe to be true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, we have to at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter unworkable territory, because the reference frame doesn't match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do, which is it pretends to be dead, runs away, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I can't believe this.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked to human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is because of its direct participation in short-term memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and seems to be completely lacking among other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the basis for the assumption that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature should be the way man speaks: since a large part of life is connected with language, it is often said to be connected with consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness is not dependent on language, it would influence it so that the animal's consciousness, as it is made, would certainly differ greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That's why it's hard to see how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If you can't measure it as something internal and subjective, analyze it through your own experience because of the special hardware, their research will give us big problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to have access.
You could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their content, and that's exactly what happens in studies of primate short-term memory, particularly the visualization example.
So this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, moves to neural correlates of consciousness rather than to causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for visualization implementation.
What, then, is the outline of feelings?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of your conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) occupies working memory.
So, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
With the speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activity of the sensory cortex and paleocephalus regions of the body, similar to Jack Pankseep, who has, however, focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network hasn't changed much over the course of human evolution, this could definitely be part of the extended-species feelings.
I cannot contradict this on a purely theoretical level, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear is probably felt with the senses in both cases: but how could this be, if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroach run away from danger as if it too is afraid?
In my view, the mere similarity of behaviour cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
And so neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalopathies, cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the paleoencephalon responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuitry and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
However, there is neural progress here, provided that we do not use the same procedure on rats and humans.
Just like I don't do research on language and consciousness in rats, I don't do research on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually banging against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist, to be exact.
UEFA President Platini: postponed to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise Europeans with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"This is not, however, an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both host countries are limping on the roadmap for building or rebuilding stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of European stadiums will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed", said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will be watching us constantly".
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini, we assured him that preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer".
Numerous players in the first division were convicted of manipulation last season alone, and the start of the league was even postponed until the last minute.
Dennis Quaid responds with indignation
She was promoting a new movie, she talked about her private life in an interview, and now she's having problems with her ex-husband. Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her ex-husband, Dennis Quaid, an adulterer.
He foams at the mouth and fights back.
War of the Roses in delayed outbreak for ex-spouses Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation the two Hollywood actors now fight each other in a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, first spoke about the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful".
The extent of the betrayals she would only have learned after the separation.
The opportunity for the "strip of soul" was Ryan's press job for her new film "The Women"  tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his publicly stated adulterous husband was a stark contrast: it would be "unheard of", the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg is repeating and reworking the story of our relationship for the one and only time".
It would also be "deplorable" if Jack, their 16-year-old son, were again "to be publicly reminded of the pain and subversion that separation means for every child".
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and soon to be a father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family where everything is going well".
Airline and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and hotel stays have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, saw a marked decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, overnight stays have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still rise by an average of around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express attributes this to the weak dollar, which would have led to a "diminishing desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be hit by the recession in hotel prices more than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices are even the highest in Europe, rising by 26.3%.
The trend in the first quarter was also upward in terms of flight prices:
Because of the price of kerosene, passengers in Economy Class had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul fuel-intensive flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, airline ticket prices in Economy Class fell on average by 12.5% compared with the previous quarter, although price changes in First and Business Class were much weaker.
In Germany prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose by 11.9% and fell by 23.6% in the second quarter.
The study also showed that prices for domestic German flights have even halved.
The reason for the fall in prices is, on the one hand, the downward trend in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, would increase competition pressure.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the airlines are able to operate on the market in the Union.
HSV beat Gladbach by 1-0.
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein makes the lucky landing worse for national player Marko Marin .
Gladbach's player first came in late and missed a shot on the crossbar.
His message was articulated with precision, it was passed over his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal", exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the lobby of the Hamburg arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for almost three decades, enjoying even greater esteem from certain former players.
And so his warning was heard even in the high places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Not everything here was nice to see today", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also reportedly "wanted to be more relaxed".
For the 1-0 Hamburg have to thank the head kick from Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the very weak players from Gladbach could not hurt the weak players from Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win", Martin Jol summed up.
The SV Hamburg will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated earlier, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing leaderboard on the video screen, which legitimized their sports society as first in class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"we can fix everything", said Marcell Jansen.
He has a feeling that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the league than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late  the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the goal Petric as well as Jansen blew to FC Bayern  slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more dribbling", Jol starts off.
After the vote was lost
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the bailout's failure temporarily brought the Dow Jones down 700 points.
This was the largest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later, Down recovered a little.

The Nasdaq technology stock market was flat with a deficit of over 7% at 1,548 points.
The biggest losers at that time were the Dow American Express, which returned just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it .
The shares of Goldman Sachs dropped by just 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had joined the venture.
The rescue plan was to provide financial resources for the seizure of the so-called mortgage documents
The sum must be paid, however, not in one fell swoop, but in stages.
The State had to keep the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with a suitable price trend, in order to reduce the charge on the State treasury.
The stock market in Europe and the USA in the downward spiral

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon - dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has flown through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the rapidly freezing fuel pipes, she now faces death by freezing.
Scientists have been puzzled for years by a mysterious phenomenon called the Swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver by space probes, whereby they gain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has puzzled scientists for years is that rockets do not behave quite as one would expect from the law of gravity.
In fact, it leads to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton firmly believes as before Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter that could be very close to Earth", he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
Evidently, an attractive force emanates from it, and its effect on the other heavenly bodies is seen.
It is itself completely invisible, that is, it neither emits nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt are reportedly free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout before the release, six kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already under way.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after a report on Italian television station Sky TG 24 said: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are examining their health status", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions are said to be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released is still unclear: hence, the kidnappers, following the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer, were said to be ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the official said.
It was "just about to take over the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the Sudan, Chad and Egypt border area shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany, which was to be paid by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom reported, citing a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuses by Stepfather "Lead to Suicide"
Years of abuse by a stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court has said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for six years after admitting to eight counts of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court heard that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
In a note of confession, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court heard that Miss Randle had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she was a child and living in Coventry, Trerise molested her and bandaged her before having sex while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had caused her.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends of Miss Randle, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "done with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She's believed to have killed herself by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession ending, "I bound and bandaged her".
"I did not molest her.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even more difficult is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up in court".
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother describe having on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she would have been a promising and happy young successful one".
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the least delicate of the charges under this law and there's nothing to suggest criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They would have thought this was being handled internally at the Mod and Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the act, the information protection clause.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the bill of B&B
British construction companies could face a bill of over £80,000 after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has given £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford and Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, the general manager of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was "irritating" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The £14bn loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will be due in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's irritating that those institutions that have been prudent are now being asked to pay part of the bill to those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits they had, and that the companies among themselves had to pay 18 percent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million pounds to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, managing director of the Building Companies Association, told the BBC he thought it was unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions that have been cautious in the recovering housing market are now being asked to pay part of the bill to those institutions that have been far less cautious".
According to the BSA, no company has failed since records began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant bill", Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest for a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5 pence a gallon.
People in Jersey are facing having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be a wholesale price increase in its milk by an extra five pence a liter from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and it comes after a research conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to blame the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges we have against you.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks but her Awami League party has demanded that the country's military-backed interim government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on parole, it is unclear under the terms of her release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he'll appeal the High Court's order.
"The high court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request on the grounds that she cannot get bail as she is already abroad on medical parole", says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal the High Court's order".
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior Awami League party leader said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against them.
Fear of the Afghan polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing out on the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-linked violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival television station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the Competition Court of Appeal to cut its share in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously said that BSkyB's participation was hindering competition and allowing it to exert an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV's stake cast doubt on ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's chief executive, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation came about when a report on the case by the Justice Department's inspector general criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was sparked by fears that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or established", said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the fired lawyers had not been rated worse than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the firing was politically motivated.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in prosecuting high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegation of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. attorneys investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the firing storm, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The inspector general's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying he had primary responsibility for the firings, had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including former senior Bush aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loafs' epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect his special gold award at a ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to earn the recognition.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of them".
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocals that were provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album stayed on the charts for almost nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that she had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, others merely used.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street  without making Second Street  between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than a busy street.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see on a normal atlas.
The street must, however, have admirers.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the real estate company for the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
They want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that are supposed to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were struck by the shortcut simply because it was one of the last remnants of the once-proud neighborhood.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Development, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the county's city land use board, representatives from the city and Avalon Bay agency outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, district manager of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left on city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place", he said.
"There may be proposals to set it up and run it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access".
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it would reopen the small street and install seating, including some for a café that the real estate company hopes to rent the space to.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity", he said, adding that the city had suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was in fact the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe it was named in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The terrain was beautiful", said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, bits of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes".
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about the "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity  a piece of city that has changed almost nothing and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Slightly Nostalgic Look at the City on the Brink of Extinction"), published part of a Discourse on the History of the City that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even in the daytime, with rusty iron warehouse doors and window sills, with weeks-old newspapers flying down the slums".
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat was agilely running across the back of the street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lying next to a bunch of freshly abandoned newspapers.
A few passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested it would need a little embellishment.
Mr Fields, for his part, said he thought some people underestimated the attractiveness of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life", she said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places".
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School".
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's education projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students, "which is true.
To address these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's education plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in classrooms in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, a surprising 100 percent of students passed the top-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
Equally astonishingly, 93 percent of fourth graders passed the English Language Arts Proficiency Test.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from the one Mr. Obama preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant evaluation of skills and a no-excuse attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the manager of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion".
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico, and if you walked into the classroom 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to tell which one it was".
"It works", he observed, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate in other schools with a majority of Hispanic and English students?
The school's achievements make the answer to that question very easy, but the education policy in his own party (the National Education Associations is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and his own continued support for bilingual education prevent Mr. Obama's answer from being predictable.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently trivialized the topic when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you must make sure your children are able to speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should be looking at the educational models that work rather than dismissing or trivializing them.
Oil plunges and economic fears renew
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the US bailout plan for financial markets may fail to revive the economy.
Oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety hit investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest installment of the gradual merger, Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the weekend's frantic trading led to a bailout deal "seemed to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to ease.
"The outlook for global equities, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a raw material perspective our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption drops due to slowing economic growth, cutting oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter is a team record.
After spending more time in the Jets uniform than anyone else in the last eight seasons, quarterback Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a comeback.
"Never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equalized the grey of the threatening clouds overhead with a sluggish game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their rising tune took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left in the first half.
"I didn't go out of my way", Favre said of all the passes that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people may think".
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense was hitting Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a pass and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith saw another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens is forced to fumble for Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, might have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had recovered the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal, to a 34-0 lead.
That's more than the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When asked both - the Jets gave up 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third".
There were a lot of points in a short space of time".
Gebrselassie rested beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has once again shown why many consider him the greatest marathon runner of all time, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the favourably flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous mark of 2:03:26 from last year's Berlin race by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record in a career so stunning that it has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympics marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo of the Brazilian Coast won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in his calves and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest has left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy", Gebrselassie told reporters in the newsroom.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well".
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying on the open runway as if it were a half-finish race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace of four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, kept Gebrselassie in the race after the runway was cleared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final climb to separate himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is being described as a bad accident, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race with good math, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a big gap, picking it up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and trials of a black life
Tucked away in the sprawling theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, just a few miles from the glamour, the noise, the enormity, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come into being.
Eatonville, the first all-black incorporated city in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison".
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city he described - and which makes tourists stop by including it in the Depression-era Florida tour guide produced by the Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart.
It's as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little about us, doesn't know what he's missing".
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called to give an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told", said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It's both a historic pattern of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It's a literary center but also an example in the shade of oak trees of the rural black culture of the South -- sometimes despised, sometimes awarded -- born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through heartfelt, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guidebook transformed the town, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida into a backdrop of black history and human drama.
Low as a houseboat in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted them to more private areas.
"Outside the street on the left", he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white trim, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could barely read and write".
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the hallways".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
Clearly, this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora told it like it was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalizes, quoting men who sing crude songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it".
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family's move to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts decent clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others grinned.
"People were always very glad to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
But, he added, rocking in her chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial services, and no great conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A change occurred in the 1980's.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane freeway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the community's relative idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white kids came and threw oranges and stuff at people sitting on one side", says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who got killed by that once.
They threw a watermelon out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston petitioned the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that desegregation of schools, while positive in some respects, dilutes the cohesion of Eatonville and jeopardizes the confidence of its youth.
"Black kids used to be hugged - I remember this - you hug your teacher in the morning, you hug your teacher in the evening", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural divide there", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and made room for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - a black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as she did, with cheerful self-assurance and lines like, "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookstore shelves, reintroducing her into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter was back in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway, have brought what you would call high speed, a real pride for the city", Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project helped change the city's image of itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story bookstore (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a back street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for the history of Eatonville, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A prior permission is required for most interviews, some things - like the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a chubby schoolteacher with a soft spot for bright red, still fear their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet as the Hurston Festival expanded, so did a high level of civic pride.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his whole race: beautiful, troubled and all, neither better nor worse and proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, who he said might need help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just walked in here, will think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon after the mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the history, it's a really pretty town".
Here in New York we all speak fluently of finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice they were in the eye of the storm.
They would never guess that the glass offices, beehives over their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are having their worst "bad day at the office" every day since the 1929 crash.
Couriers shake metal tea carts across sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet through apartment buildings carrying, like human mules, 50 broken stretched shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees still wait in line for their morning bagels at the food trucks on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to catch a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a workday.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the event to coincide with my late afternoon break at my JPMorgan Chase branch, a line of about 20 was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions to Macy's department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of the people in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "trusted banker", were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they've already taken savings from smaller banks from places they commute from, like those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrift (a bit like a building society), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches only operate within a state, and they say they treat customers like family.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was placed into receivership, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to bail it out.
The employees and salespeople who were standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that was perceived as a safe haven, the bank that was asking for more collateral from Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers in the last few weeks have become financially competent.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld as if they were familiar, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed doorwoman, almost 50, from my apartment building, changed the subject from our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like those road signs representing mosques with a red line running through the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained a big lead in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were badly damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in the hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols like the Star of David on some of the graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear if the incident is connected to the election in any way.
A spokesman for the local Muslim community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, has embarked on a journey of spiritual searching following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with strongly anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party that won more than 18 percent of the vote, has campaigned against veils and burqas and has also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the election, which established the far right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicate that change was being driven predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter's travel ban has expired.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities who were monitoring him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent police last Thursday after they provided evidence to magistrates of Glitter's previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Courthouse in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Courthouse, Kent Police filed a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days' notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authority can result in a prison sentence of up to five years.
Kent police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible movements around the country.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children at home and abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county to minimise any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, she flew to Bangkok where she was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities wouldn't let him pass passport control and he eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge courthouse, west of London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him on the sex offender registry.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no flyers, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the performance, to look at the appearance of relaxed man or woman.
On one side, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two faces inseparable, except in private, in those moments away from the audience, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they don't have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots with singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different viewing angles.
The exhibition, included in the program of the month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, which is growing every day", explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be about ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists who can convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personalities of these great men, you don't have to portray them on stage.
Because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with my camera the personalities of the great flamenco players".
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day".
Not the dancing, singing or playing itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to capture the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" (SportARTproject).
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits, "I love to portray people, get to know them and be able to penetrate for a moment into their lives, whether it's a long moment or a short one.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you sometimes don't even know or who only give you a few minutes to take a picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled "Flamenco-people", is on display at the El Fotómata gallery, at 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "joke"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and crossed the Amazon.
The writer, who has always been favored for the Nobel Prize for Literature, admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is working on today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it".
"If I had good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible", he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of Aqueducts.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as expected, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for being the most voted writer by the participants  an old edition of Dickens' book "Our mutual friend", filled the seats at the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a crowd whose time flew by when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and great dose of humor, recalled how his literary vocation was born, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "living beyond what I lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" to make up for the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous re-making; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how "memory images" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, who acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a fleeting experience", Vargas Llosa pointed out, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that it "makes people more anticonformist".
The weather is hampering the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights.
The bullfighting celebration that was supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the ground conditions on the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather has taken its toll on this festival, preventing two days of celebration out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
The list included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were due to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion, Daniel Luque triumphed, cutting off three ears and being taken out in triumph, after bullfighting with taste and aesthetics.
On the same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights by receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the audience than by the merit of the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a terrible crutch, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A truck with 2,000 kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint in Alava
Five to ten in the morning.
Officers alert the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping flee.
Officers alerted two occupants of a van who fled instead of stopping.
Their cargo, over two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After chasing them, the officers managed to arrest one of the occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The individual arrested is charged with drug trafficking and falsifying public documents.
The accident occurred when some traffic officials in Alava were carrying out a traffic check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal constituency of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, in defiance of orders, abruptly accelerated and passed the checkpoint.
Officers pursued the vehicle for a few miles until it stopped on the side of the road and the two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The agents of the State Administration were able to arrest one of the fugitives and confiscate the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting.
The hash panels, which were found in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently taken into police custody for further investigation and weight testing.
Furthermore, since officials determined that the license plate had been "duplicated" because it did not match the one on the van's documentation, the arrested man was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Detainee A.A.J., 28, has been taken to the police station for due process and will be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence.
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the hit show Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to drive her car out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol telling People magazine.
The witness specified that at about 4:30 p.m. Locklear "was squeezing the gas, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt back and forth maneuvers.
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear pull over to a nearby road and get out of the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was concerned for Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked confused", and that's why the officers took her to a drug and alcohol treatment center to get tested.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was dismissed from the beginning, although "based on what officers observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked into the local jail around 7 p.m., only to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released rehabilitated from a specialty clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the United Left party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former youth and sports councillor of the Seville municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following accusations of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organisation that will have to take its responsibilities", said Llamazares regarding the resolution the party will have to adopt against the man who has been an alderman in the Seville council until now.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva allegedly committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be as transparent as possible".
He also stressed that training is governed by "very strict ethical codes for all public posts".
"Sangre de mayo", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci reprises the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de mayo, the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
With this film, the director has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, which runs for more than two and a half hours, opens in cinemas on Friday, and will be a four-hour miniseries on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and he believes he has to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of 2 May in Madrid.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to recreate the appropriate settings and customs to portray a "stunned Spain that made the wrong choice of leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge development delay under Ferdinand VII's reign", Garci noted.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to that of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the scenography that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has affected what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often rehearses before shooting with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating", considering that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works".
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, rehearse in front of his machine, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should be known instead".
Garci doesn't expect any prizes from this film.
"At first you think you are working for posterity, then you realize you are working only for prosperity, and at some point you are content to just make one more film", explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sicilian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer pays tribute to another dancer from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a freestyle dancer and an oriental dancing specialist.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's emancipation, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and she advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two world wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have loved to have worked with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character.
She says: "We don't pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing was also part of this aesthetic", she explains.
The staging features two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been his pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he has agreed to work on my work and I feel very honored".
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists like Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi by Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola by Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been gods all around, and who have always had many hobbies".
The work also presents in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, particularly for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, because, as usual, she resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers her and even less considers her work as something of value", says Bayon.
The show will begin today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also marks the end of the Triennium.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Cultural Advisory Board of the Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the re-issue of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chico de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having reached the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York at the same time as the International Congress.
In addition, the Culture Department of the Andalusian Government has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Poet Re-Encased", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
I like America a little less without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The line is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia de malicia", and it gives an idea of the powerlessness of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
And yet it took a lot to get him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond words, and I have now lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of his existence".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and of the country died at a particularly dark time, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperately searching for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so hard, men so devoid of virtue and still good people to admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, from the anti-drug foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of an overdose to the creation of the organic home-food brand.
All gifts to a country that has had a hard time moving beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not one man died, an era ended.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He set a very high standard for all of us", observes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few today who tries to live as Paul Newman did - keeping a high regard for the need for integrity and for a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try, and Paul Newman is a good example of this.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful though certainly not lacking opportunities to be otherwise.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today when I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was more proud of him than that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and passionate philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect run of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics will eventually be held in Madrid, and after the failed attempt in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were taken into account later in the evaluation and I had to examine it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the back-up, which meant you had to go first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they make you go, make sure you take everything back (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you didn't.
You had to go just to get the back (first nonsense, go just for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they only had 'S' size T-shirts (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
What kind of world are we living in?
Is it the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, things like that are nothing compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to get there very early to get the chip, the queue was 15 minutes long, and, moreover, you had to deposit your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected to draw more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race began before we had even put our backpacks down, although once we succeeded in the undertaking, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
At least 500 people tomorrow will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, won't even be listed in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, didn't properly register the arrival.
In the future, if people ask me about the perfect race, this is not going to be on my mind.
So I think we're gonna keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist.
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft first presented a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) by assisting the telephone user.
Using a camera and a face recognition system, this receptionist can know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and listen and understand key words in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he is not from the group with which he is talking and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if she is visiting someone and says that she will be available shortly.
All without the blue screen.
That's really impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will have fewer associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had the essential functions and were less loaded with commercial junk, they would go five times faster -- hey! Steve, it's for the less.
A big discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version, has continually added to Windows features and "extras".
The change in direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing its importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the web, I was one of those who argued for the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
It serves the same function as your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but perhaps we need to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You just take your computer and you launch Explorer or Firefox or Chrome, and you spend more time every day browsing the web than you do in a remote Windows environment.
What's half the applications in the operating system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to be a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'll give you a little example.
I took the photo in this post in one of the Microsoft employee recreation centers in Redmond earlier this month.
A sign on the soda machine urges them to use their own research tool - "Your Research. Our Future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, it was confirmed that the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not be on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably by the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more like a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the French Riviera, Leonardo Di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and was part of the typical gay parish uniform.
And if we try to enumerate the star appearances, we can conjure up the image of the pointy-moustached outlaw lifting weights in the traveling circus.
It is basically a typical men's shirt, with a cotton inside, sleeveless and buttoned up.
It's the tank, as the English speakers call it, although, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
'Marcel' stands out amongst others for the high quality of its cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive emblem and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most iconic models of the shirt wear as a detail on their necks.
'Marcel' stands out amongst others for the high quality of its cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive emblem and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most iconic models of the shirt wear as a neck detail.
And be careful, because the Belgian company's production is not only about the famous tanks.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, navy shirts, baby dolls, mini-shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't bother me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of life.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they're more than pretty girls and celebrities who lend their names.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango brand has made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Hot and shy, she gets you fast.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for the fall-winter Mango season, as well as to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
Let's just say, a very busy day, but at the same time, exciting.
What elements are the basis of your new Mango collection in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both like movies from the '50s and '60s, and we get a lot of inspiration from that.
And then I love getting lost in the city and watching how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even though in the end, it all comes together and there are many elements in common.
I loved clothes from a young age, and I longed to go to my grandmother's house to look through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, as a dancer, I always paid close attention to my clothes.
We know that dancers like to have their own style to go to classes and to rehearsals, to look at themselves in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you're handed the wardrobe, that's when you actually meet the character.
So, it all goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you had a breakdown?
But no, you didn't.
I've never felt better. I like the idea of 30.
I find that women at that age are mature and have a good experience of enjoying life while making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl, and that has brought me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body is asking me to be, and I also want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not too worried.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for the release of several films shot last year.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything immediately and clearly, but it can't always be like this.
I want to see "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" come out.
Let's see if you like them.
A few days ago, you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
It's just that Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity run for her organization Women for a Better World, and the clothes we exhibited - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - were auctioned off to raise money for this NGO of Naomi's.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
There are so many things said about her, that I, who have known her for a long time, can tell you that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part you're involved in.
He asked me to march for a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help women in the Third World, you can't back out.
Repeat drinkers will have to install the alcohol lock
The Home Office requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol levels to install a system in their car that prevents them from driving while intoxicated or if they don't blow into the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Prosecutor General, which says it will be a one-year pilot project.
The aim of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
The initiative will be supported by the Directorate-General for Road Safety (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers who are reported for drunk driving more than once then drive again.
The alcohol lock would prevent this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher than permissible concentration of alcohol is detected.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the person sanctioned.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices reduce infringements by up to 65% in the first year of their introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
The Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and no peep-toes.
At 5:40 p.m. on the second day of the flight, the Spanish plane carrying the princes of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced me to use my hand as a visor to watch the royal couple get off the plane.
At the bottom of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the road, if he knew that Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very well.
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the Asturian princes are and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar, crushed on the red carpet and the military cordon of 27 marines offering the salute.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, stares into the wind, very sober, not using her usual peep-toes, perhaps she has been told that bad weather threatens Mexico City.
They give the photographers a smile and a short pause before moving on to the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of their hotel, one of the four largest in the city, they are met by a witty Mexican television reporter.
The Best Award in Fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no designer more exquisite and good-natured than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote international promotion of new talent in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her drawings in the window of Mango at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried from emotion.
It is also the company's second largest store in Europe and has just opened with a floor area of 1,335 square metres.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With Chagal's finest paintings nearby, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, heartbroken and making virtue of necessity, because of the recent death of his brother, he wore a House dress and some compliments of ELAH to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and as a knight he ended up, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had sold them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the store in pants and a shirt  designed by her hand  transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and was thrilled during the night walk with Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk around the palace premises, but she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone before.
The next day we were delighted to have Olivier Martinez - another young man who rides his motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets and towels, and had made sure in advance that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, there, that's the way.
1001, the stress number.
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that wasn't enough, they're all in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the hectic pace of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to break away from the world of work.
No, this number is nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has a menu of options tailored to your tastes and time.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calmness will reach bookstores thanks to publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is impossible to achieve calmness in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "handbook" refutes that belief.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your adrenaline is not already flowing through your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, shut your mind off and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night.
I'm not talking about those who wake up very excited to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but those babies who talk while they're asleep.
The first time it happens, you're just gonna get scared, but it doesn't really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somnolence.
It occurs with some frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure most of you have been told that you have talked in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with a high fever episode) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes these episodes are linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting, or sleepwalking, but not necessarily.
As mentioned earlier, it may be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
In any case, it is still a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may be that the person speaks with a very calm tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (yells, shouts, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it may be wise to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there is something that is causing the abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We have said that it is a benign disorder so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stressful situations).
What can be done, however, is to consider a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the baby too much before bedtime.
Offer quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that inspire fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children who find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleepwalkers show up, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's going on, and you'd interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember, if he appears very anxious and the episodes are frequent, it is best to see a doctor or to see where such great anxiety is coming from in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You're not getting anything, because he's asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you can hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming to say, so you must be very careful about interpreting the information and the conclusions it might lead to.
Never tell a child that you might ask him questions at night to learn his secrets.
Not even for fun.
Something like this causes a tremendous amount of distress.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illushaeern... finally
Illhaeusern have finally found their way back to victory at home after a long period of fruitlessness.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-blacks created the most number of net chances turning one into the game winner.
The pace was not very sustained during this match in which the attackers were barely expressed.
After a first attempt by the guest team captain Kauffmann who touched the seventh with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern started to have the better and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn high, Romain point and again Diebold.
Dannemarie responded with a block in midfield, leaving only the unruly Riahi in the attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two opening chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais net for Illhaeusern, well placed, he recovered a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the gunner of the Ilhaeusern will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be ejected a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of this and will not pose any major problems to the Illhaeusern Eleven, who retreated just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the very last minutes of the game when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stopover in Britain.
In view of the demonstration by fishermen who on Monday brutally blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère department, on Tuesday morning to charm the representatives.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
A presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the 'crisis committee', set up by Breton fishermen to take measures to cope with the soaring price of diesel, which has reached an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the Elysée's spokesman, David Martinon, the president will "discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure working conditions and salary for seafarers".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on their feet.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "slime operations" in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-île were not cut.
A roadblock has been put in place on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as they took to the streets of Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to ports on the Atlantic and English Channel coasts, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where fishing boats have remained at the docks, or Le Havre, where some 20 boats have prevented commercial ships from moving.
Fishermen from La Turballe et du Croisic, near the Loire, broke the blockade of the famous Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer, they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the Ministry to decide on any action.
The 'crisis committee' in Guilvinec will decide on Tuesday on the future actions of the movement and on its possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, which did not support the motion.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not give in' and 'they have no intention of moving to Paris', for example, said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents a litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is only reached with diesel below 0.30 euros a litre.
Paul Newman the great
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have all paid tribute to the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its forecast for 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threat of recession weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its chairman Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half, he delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, rebuilt by the US monetary authorities, is to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay an $85 billion loan, according to the Financial Times Sunday edition.
AIG is ready to consider selling most of its business, as well as divesting its life insurance business to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than reliable sources.
The French authorities have not provided any information on the sale of the assets.
No confirmation from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to sell include the aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
France Télécom continues that no final decision has been taken on these divestments.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan it received from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities take over 80% of its capital.
Paris: morning meeting news
The New York Stock Exchange plunged historically on Monday after the House of Representatives voted against Paulson's plan to bail out financial institutions. The Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, a record drop, to close to 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is down to 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day the stock markets reopened following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the main technology stock index, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the enlarged Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1,106.55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralised at the start of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the delegates rejected the funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a negative signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan", said FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza.
"All this shows how much the market was counting on the project", he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project is really dying ... then the check will be quickly passed to the Fed  Federal Reserve and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
The European Parliament has also been asked to vote on the draft resolution on the European Parliament's budget for the financial year 2000.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities have arranged for Wachovia's banking assets to be purchased by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting urgent action on behalf of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are facing not just a US crisis, but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell to 3,632%, down from 3,827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year yield was 4,161%, down from 4,357% the day before.
Obama ahead in first televised duel
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates for the White House, here's a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their respective victories in the televised duel, followed by a third of American households.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow the decline in opinion polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has had the upper hand.
A snap poll conducted by CBS News of a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them believe Obama to be the winner, while 25% believe McCain.
A strong performance by his running mate Joe Biden, expected in his first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good intuition", Bill Clinton warned this weekend, however.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undeniable foreign policy experience, pointing out the "naivety" of his opponent regarding the topics discussed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he has often said on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to be president", he said.
Which has been a constant target for the Republican TV campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without going into great lengths, he was concise and precise.
He promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama", he said this weekend, rebuffing a Democratic spot, rebuking the Republican for not taking the necessary steps to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina in a downpour for a rally.
The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, who is seen by Americans as the best person to save the economy from the brink of collapse.
"Next week could be a watershed moment", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policies adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's upheavals, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a fleet of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
The two candidates have cautiously dodged questions about the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night that is extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "didn't you notice there was an election?"
Young people and opposition demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to protest the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening just after polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the elections.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit that they didn't even vote :"Why? They'll do whatever they want with my vote", says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has been a good image to foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to make a democratic breakthrough.
Sanctions, including a visa ban on 40 Belarusian officials and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections are deemed legitimate by election observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the election commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the vote count", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of 12 parties.
"It is a change of face", says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and leader of the pro-European movement, "because it is who counts the ballots that counts, and in this case it is the executive.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve a television space, regional meetings and bills".
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, goes into crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election process, will recognise the validity of the vote.
He stressed that turnout seemed too high and that the widespread use of early voting (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) had led to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient to the government".
The night silence falls on the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are cheering their success.
The Encounter - Blood is Safe Again
Hema-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Decary, had every reason to rejoice, for Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, he has regained the public's trust, which was seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood banks run by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980's.
In response to this tragedy and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent a similar disaster from occurring again.
While Judge Krever was slow to issue a report, some provinces set up a committee with the goal of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and the two territories.
When Héma-Québec began operations in 1998, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the Quebec donation system, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the years, we have regained public trust", she says, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population in Quebec now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary believes that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the woman who has been its president since 1998.
"And we had absolutely no idea that the disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when there is doubt and a serious illness could result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which manifests itself as a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, blood was refused to those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Now, in recent years, it has been shown that this disease is transmitted without question by infected blood.
This incident thus showed us that the precautionary principle made sense".
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NATs), which allow the presence of the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors rather than antibodies against it, on which previous tests were based.
TANs have shortened the window from when a person has contracted the disease to when the first viruses can be detected in the bloodstream with our techniques, she explains.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and thus not being able to detect them has been greatly reduced.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before anyone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will be more than 24 years before a transfusion-transmitted HIV case is detected.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain one's health, says the head of the Héma-Québec board.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen will pop up in the system.
Not more than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant", Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also ensure that they are sufficient.
"Needs increase as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average make up only 3% of Quebecers who are eligible to donate".
However, all healthy persons over 18 years of age who meet the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where it is prevalent, they will be rejected for a period of up to a year.
"With this 3% we can maintain an inventory that can meet the needs of hospitals.
The scarcity cases are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor group as they get older and can no longer donate.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you can barely find an hour to donate blood", says Francine Décary, saddened.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which operates the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, is now rich in stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and plan to collect more than a thousand each year.
They should be proposed for transplantation early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood collection as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Football - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact have qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A playoffs, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday in a decisive second game of the quarterfinals at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless first half on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Remember, in the first game of the home-and-home series on Friday, the Impact were defeated 2-1 at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a 3-1 opening in the home game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still be in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later in the day.
In short, Kovalev's decisive net
The Canadien and their aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn have livened up the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first game, scored a goal, made two assists, and collected a pass for a win in the Habs' quarterfinal game.
The only network signed Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable".
"He tried to overdo it in the first period", Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a big cheer".
Charest heads north.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
After the Liberal Party's general council, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec yesterday where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
'To expand the boundaries of our last great northern frontier': this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, through powerful visual tools, at the general council of the Quebec Liberal Party.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mill with pictures".
On three large screens, they were confused by spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Big means like in the middle of an election campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The 'Northern Plan' is the fourth item in a 'project' which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a 'new economic area', which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what precise priorities will be given for future projects.
He only mentioned what he considered deserved priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has seen several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "territory twice the size of France" is here, Quebec.
It is not only here, but it is in us", he insisted, as if to invoke a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future", he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, which makes up 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the premier said at a press conference.
"It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been reached for a long time and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government", he said.
He also said that "given climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North", referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would be in their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ d'Ungava MP), have already started the consultation of some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important post, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would also be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be 'coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment', he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we are distinguished for turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois power station Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, the creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, the creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he made another reference, this time conservative, to the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stated that it was expected to be commissioned in 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will make it", he confessed to his activists, drawing a standing ovation.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of an election in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stressed that he was certainly very busy, particularly on a Federal Council mission to China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The general council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular on "constitutional aspirations" which passed like a whistle: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of "Quebec's specificity" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the draft Northern Plan was met with scepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
She said the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If she had done so, 'we would have made progress today' said Marois, standing next to the Jean-Talon candidate (voting today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has declared its support for the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"We hope that this will not be seen as a spectacle", said leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont on his return from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Justice Minister in the Harper cabinet, who dared to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration in this way says a lot about the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government which is the only one of the Western countries involved which has not repatriated a citizen of its own held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that has no regard for the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager when the alleged crimes took place.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, reneges on its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to establish the defendant's guilt.
For your information, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are calling for Omar Khadra to be returned to Canada to face a fair trial.
It is precisely this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps for ever, after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of 'democracy', a word that Harper keeps flaunting and that sounds so nonsensical on his lips.
We have now reached the point where there is no morality: a Canadian citizen can be mistreated, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned at the discretion of a minority government leader (let's see what happens after October 14th).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order is salvation. They do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
That's where the shame lies, Mr. Toews, in giving up all that, and nowhere else.
Free speech - The Orwellian discourse of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published by Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy managing director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold mining company has filed a six million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, squandered publishing house with the intention of initiating a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation suit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring ruin to anyone who dares to take a position contrary to theirs.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a considerable sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly odd weapons, against an army of lawyers funded from the mining company's practically bottomless pockets.
In these unequal arms wars, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensus settlement that will silence the opposition and scare anyone who dares to speak out again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it would have to present its view of the facts to the public.
Unlike in many countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are normally held by exchanging opinions and not by battering.
It would have been enough for the society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have much confidence in public opinion and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that very public is obvious?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the high-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the denigrators have a say.
What Barrack Gold does not understand  or does not want to understand  is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the light of what many perceive as a kind of muzzling (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum instructing them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the lawsuit brought by Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, which are indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are uncomfortable for the world's richest companies, or to file multiple lawsuits, who will?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, they could do it by following scientific norms like the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debate and disagreement and resolve conflict.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it is not seeking a transparent debate.
This is at the expense of the academic world, as well as the public debate itself in Canada, and it is time for governments to take steps to limit abuse lawsuits.
The operation - bailout for Wall Street  Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the top congressional leaders, representatives of both the Republican and Democratic parties, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a brake on the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It includes checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to limit the number of houses foreclosed for non-payment, and a right to inspect the salaries paid to managers of protected enterprises.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative Judd Gregg at the negotiating table announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Every decision was made in a way that safeguards the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"It's the crux of the matter: if we hadn't acted this way, inestimable distress and disruption would have poured into the daily lives of Americans", said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The deadline agreed was for the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidency, who joined the negotiations later, were quite supportive of the agreement, but did not hesitate to express their dissatisfaction at the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding provisions to the agreement, in particular the one allowing homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of state-owned enterprises.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary", he commented on the American TV screen.
When asked by another channel if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I'd like to look into the details, but I hope so".
"From what I've read, it's something we all have to digest and it'll allow us to move on".
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable", he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan aims to buy back with taxpayer money the dubious loans, risky assets and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then extended to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and led to liquidity freezes and the dissolution of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans that blew the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems that we have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone's expectations, a provision was added to the Congress that if the government were to face losses over the next five years as a result of this program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for an initial payment of 250 billion, to which 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further vote in Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will pay dividends if they make a profit and can sell them when the tide has turned.
Under the plan, the Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure proceedings on mortgage loans and to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the directors of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives, and a vote in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the bill, both on the Republican and Democratic sides.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you", Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not taking advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small congressional group dubbed the "skeptic caucus", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to jump to conclusions and to carefully consider the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would not buy its bankrupt competitor after losing EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) to the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurers.
"It is not money lost", declared Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, you get influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It's certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the English Channel, the British government appears to be nationalising another bank on the brink of financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently outstanding at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be buying the branches and client accounts of the British bank.
Since the start of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time her ace in the hole, for others her weakness.
Had he gotten rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the enchanting smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him from that circle of powerful, consecrated, veritable sacred monsters.
What a consistency!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer, remains one of the last American film icons of the roaring twenties.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but he too a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed marriages often produce magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will spring one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate quality mark.
Because he was a country full of safe-made men, a Pacific war veteran, proud of his combat, he studied drama at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before making his mark on theater, television and film.
The same civil rights activist was also the motor racing driver who finished second at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as a sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
He's gone with the shadows of a reserved, discreet, busy star, allergic to show-business scandals, whose mystery will never be fully unveiled.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend's death of Paul Newman was a heartbreaking blow to film buffs, as his great characters fill the black screen of memory.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is being re-proposed through his interpretations.
They confuse Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (Buttch Cassidy, 1969) and that boy unable to desire the fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not live up to its promise.
There are many other Paul Newman's in history.
Rocky Graziano, the boxer, the delinquent, the tormented, the violent, the unforgettable in Robert Wise's Someone Loves Me, a role originally intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Spy, magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which won him in 1987 the only Oscar out of 9 nominations.
That face over the years, it was his.
He's at it again.
The ages follow one another through its path.
Young people know him best for the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in which he played Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a final role as the Irish mob's godfather in It Was My Father in 2003.
Unlike most of the film legends who soon left the business, Newman would remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its pomp, partying and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a touch of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging his performance exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic, dead or desperate characters, of whom he expressed disdain and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer's 1968 debut (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, traced a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes poured on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had acted together in The Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness, "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love of life, two great traits of the late actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great civil rights activist, environmentalist, independent filmmaker, a contender against the Hollywood drift, is thus extinguished.
We'll have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging it a tasteless choice, though born as a gag.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, intended for his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, instead of settling for his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said, "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it was just as privileged for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, then, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Associates invoice factory?
The hearing in the criminal case against János Zuschlag and Associates will be held shortly, on 8 October.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed as part of a criminal association that caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor, the money obtained from the tendering process was used for private purposes and they often certified the activities by means of false invoices.
The State and municipal money, totalling 65 million guilders, has partly ended up in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the methodology disclosed by the investigating authorities, they withdrew the money obtained from the invitations to tender on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the blocks of invoices were purchased at the market in Józsefváros, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip through the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession, he had to choose between boarding houses and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for consumption, and the invoices were then prepared to be sent to the invitations to tender, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Many of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri, who, according to our information, mainly drafted the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But so many people, the restaurant owner says, would not all enter the place at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, is full of errors of form and content.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however, the bill listed 130 guests.
But the imaginative invoicers went too far in pointing out that Pigal Kft., also a catering company, did not even have the documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá in its accounts, according to information given to the judicial authorities.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT number of our company were in the wrong place".
He added: 'In addition to the formal reasons, the fact that the bill says 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have 11 rooms and there are not so many beds, was not relevant either.'
Plus, the bill was for catering and their restaurant hasn't been open in a while.
The diligent invoicers did not bother to find out that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only arranges trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice that they would pay for travel in cash to Hungary, which was not in line with the company's invoicing practice.
Moreover, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the VAT on the services offered by the company was 15% and not 25% as indicated on the invoices, and the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the manufactured invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the 'issuers' have ruined other invoices, in the case of one company they have indicated as their activity the transport of goods by road, as is clear from the proceedings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, an activity which was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Furthermore, because of formal defects - the case was in the form of a non-compliant invoice, a false stamp - the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were found to be false.
The same was true in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sporting Ground, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters also failed to notice that HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület had lunch there in 2001, which is why the liquidation officer of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They've been issuing invoices knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers is those who were aware that they were issuing dummy invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fake invoices.
Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation, also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners and in 2003 provided invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület, which did not involve any real economic activity.
Nor was there any movement of money because the bills prepared were then returned, but the associations forgot to mention this in their documents.
The following group of invoice companies includes those who are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized by the Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, purchased these invoices.
The CEO of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov allegedly forwarded the documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation to having issued invoices in the company's name to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervailing amount was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the firms were actually operating, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
The companies did however benefit from the fact that, at the request of the co-accused lawyer, Mr Zsolt Szente, draftsman of the company's articles of association, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag, namely Atlas and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various institutions for a total value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution believes Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices, plus VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue dummy invoices, fabricated for Biztos Pont's tender.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a bid for the public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the invitation.
To prevent this from being revealed, they submitted to the TMA five bogus invoices received by Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will probably report on the production of invoices, as they have already done in the prosecution.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything at length, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in return for compensation of 50 million guilders, a large part of the damage - would be willing to make the sacrifice.
Mr Zuschlag could have been offended for the moment, since his requests for easing of his prison conditions, i.e. granting him house arrest, have so far not been granted.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
The psychology of overbidden: Why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neuroscientists and economists at New York University have managed to uncover the neuroeconomic underpinnings of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to be left behind in a competition like the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay even a higher price.
Research has sought to trace the neural pattern of this "game" at the level of the nervous system by experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brains of the people in the experiment.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the essential element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex becomes intensively active when you lose the game.
This area of the brain, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-gratification" mechanism.
So the researchers say the price increase is explained by the scanning of the veer reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists in the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this survey, three groups bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told what the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
Another group, besides this one, was promised that if they won, they would receive another prize of $15.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the group members would lose the money if they lost at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that one group was emphasized as winning, while the other group was emphasized as losing.
Testing the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "losing" group were willing to bet higher than the control or "winning" group.
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These have so far explained the phenomena found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients is 100,000, of whom only 7,000 are being treated, because many patients are unaware that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name for infectious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and hysteria, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. infected water and food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
It is useful for travellers to get vaccinated against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine for C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After yellow spots form on the skin and whites of the eyes, the stool becomes clear and the urine dark, healing occurs within two to three weeks.
A million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason is that only one in ten people is estimated to receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences. If left untreated, it can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know they have the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years.
So prevention and regular medical checks are very important.
This disease is much more common than average in three groups: those who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus today is 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worthwhile to consult your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
If the disease is recognized early, it can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, and the infectious power can be stopped and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
World Hepatitis Day is observed on 30 September, first organized in 2004 by the World Hepatitis Association.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, its causes and early detection.
Do people who believe in God feel less pain?
A recent survey found that religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment examining the effect of faith in God on the feeling of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were electrocuted while all were looking at a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Through the human brain exploration technique, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first in a series of studies involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from the university.
The test went exactly as follows: An instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassopheratus and the Lady with the Hermitage by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time frame received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while looking at either the religious painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "secure", as if "someone was taking care" of them and "they were reassured and filled with peace".
When they looked at the religious-themed image, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they had the Leonardo painting in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the test, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image that has a strong effect even on atheists, but the right image must be found.
"We have to look for an image that they have very positive feelings about, like a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it does change our personality", Wright added.
After the excellent results, the only question remains: If a painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect might it have on pain control?
Would a vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say you are
On their 10th birthday, Google can claim to be in people's pockets as much as it is in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what clinics they go to and what they are interested in.
But that, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the firm's directors, is not enough.
As for the skeptics who compare it to the Orwellian nightmare, they don't see the essence of Web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to adhere to the original goal of the founders of Google which was: "let's put all the information in the world in one system!".
According to the Google executive interviewed, the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, is still in the beginning of being able to manage all information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What am I doing tomorrow?" or "What would be the right job for me?" but software cannot answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their Internet searches, exactly what words they are searching for are recorded, from which IP address they are searching for and on which page they stop after searching.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their browsing history, can look at what they have searched and clicked, these will then in the long run generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our preferences declared and registered previously.
What if my data is used against me, if they look at what I'm doing? - users worried about Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the reaction of netizens is caused by fear of the potential power of the company, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against the power.
One fact is confirmed, however, namely that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
But concerned Internet users for their personal rights were relieved in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even after that, Google cannot be forced under any provision of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully cracked almost 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords from two months ago.)
Google's assessment is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data to Google because they believe that this will affect their private sphere and privacy by starting to use its services and rise with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users in many countries see them as the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft, which is being dismissed as a conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both are fighting for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which implies one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the essence is the same: showing ourselves.
A young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can be inserted into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which his latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous examples of how the girl, seeing the series of pictures taken in the morning by her friends, can easily find out who her mean boyfriend spent the night with or how a company can fire an employee for writing a sincere opinion about the company's top management. One thing is certain, the concept of privacy has now been completely reconsidered.
The online life is about showing yourself and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google's search engine but at the same time not leaving any traces).
There are a lot of people who don't register on community pages on purpose to avoid being found, and Google's online applications, from word processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and that don't make up our best profile yet.
The public is not secretly waiting for the moment when Google will pull its claws out.
Currently the company with its 156 billion dollars worth is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, services introduced in record time cause instead big problems not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critics find some alarming points alongside this: the company's top management, for example, completely rejected the employees' protest after doubling the company's daycare fee, deemed it too expensive to repeatedly cater to the employees' daily pleasure, all of which is dwarfed by the fact that in 2006 Google bowed its head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter all results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is usable, but one thing is for sure, that the predictable problems of the next months and years will move the world to a point: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will take on such proportions that the company will soon be in front of the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the famous short story Scroogled by Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, where a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped Ózd's double murderer cover his tracks.
Police have questioned two minors in connection with the double murder of Ózd, who are suspected of helping to cover up the crime, the spokesman for the Borsod Police Prefecture said on Tuesday.
The youths have confessed to the crime they are accused of, and are currently being charged with aiding and abetting.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI, are defending themselves at large.
Favouring is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the Ózd double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
You're a suspect in a multiple murder for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, so last Wednesday he deceived his creditor into a construction site in Ózd where he killed himself and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
Police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million, or about CZK 5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the shares listed on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
The 99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 says that the Polish bid represents the highest figure ever submitted for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner of all the parties involved and he did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
The shareholders' agreement was that almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Česká Spořitelna Bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis as seen by European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday commentaries on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster was caused by the US president, La Repubblica accuses, who was unable to rally his party behind a hastily passed law designed to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire superfinance mogul Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even a section of the Madrid press sees Washington as a scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has pushed the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat is no longer something to be ignored - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout doughnut to faltering financial institutions and with taxpayers' money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse like a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions raised more than 100 billion euros, according to Der Standard, a Vienna newspaper, which said that the fears that European taxpayers, like those in the US, will have to put their hands in their pockets to help the crisis seemed more and more real.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has swept across the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to wave the €100 billion away immediately, but it would be better if they could decide when to use taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the hornet's flight
What better way to develop collision avoidance technologies than by mimicking obstacle sensors found in nature?
Like the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, hornets gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic idea for how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic mini-car with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
"The bees flying form their own oval personal space that really looks like our protective shield", explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development at the exhibition.
The bee's eyesight is important, with a 300-degree view in every direction.
Engineers have tapped into the laser telemetry idea to mimic the bee's visual function.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor which immediately turns it into a collision avoidance command.
In a fraction of a second, the robot senses the obstacle and then, imitating the bee's movements, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the crash.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, is entirely instinctive.
"If it weren't for this, the robot car wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology is the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collisions are currently considered inevitable.

So instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.

The written version of the $700 billion bailout bill was drafted to purchase disproportionate credit, to be applied in multiple parts.
In the first step, half the sum is spent.
In new deals that lasted until midnight Saturday, congressional leaders agreed on a $700 billion bailout plan after days of debate, Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, who said the only thing left to do is put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, speaking about the compromise result, said the program will work and be effective, but there is still much work to be done.
The written version of the plan was released before the Asian markets opened at 8 a.m. (Washington time) but did not bring much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the 2008 Economic Stabilization Act, which covers the program, before the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
We welcome the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy, said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which envisaged that the $700 billion would be spent entirely on the purchase of bonds with disproportionate credit behind them.
Now, as a first step, we can spend up to half of the $700 billion, $250 billion immediately after the vote in Congress on Monday, with which the Treasury will buy bonds with disproportionate credit behind them, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special board will oversee the program, which includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion is dependent on a new congressional order.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy loans, mortgages and bonds with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can be done through auctions and directly - the ministry officials announced.
The legal provision makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance scheme whereby the Treasury guarantees the means of concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damages.
Henry Paulson said: the law provides the means necessary for $700 billion to come in for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it's buying the wrong financial assets, or insuring them, or avoiding the risk of a major financial institution collapsing.
We will take all necessary steps to be ready to introduce the newly signed law", he added.
Bank managers in crisis and waiting for state bailout instead think the government will limit their exit, which overseas slang simply calls golden parachutes.
The limitations on payments will only be in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury will provide the aid.
The limitation basically means that if the ministry buys it at auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute unless they retire the fallen bank manager.
When direct purchases of disproportionate loans are made, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not overstated.
In addition, the existing Golden Parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only for new ones to incentivise participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on CEO pay has been put in place, said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
The State also has the right to take a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk to taxpayers, since they can also ultimately benefit from it if the economy, and with it the bailed-out bank, recovers.
The bill calls for the president to submit to Congress a proposal within five years on how to reimburse taxpayers for projected financial loss.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed doubts about the project.
This is not what the American people have asked us to do, not to defend taxpayer dollars", said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes the measures were taken by the same people responsible for the Wall Street crash.

Industrial domestic sales prices in the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also rose slightly, by 0.1% compared with July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in the leather and footwear processing sector (2,8%), mainly handbags and belts with 4,6% and footwear production with 2,5% monthly increase.
The high price level of raw materials in plastics and chemicals led to a significant monthly increase of 1.6% in the products and chemicals sector.

The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased by between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in industrial domestic sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in gas prices by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared with 12 months, when considering domestic sales in manufacturing sectors, the largest increases were in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metal products prices rose by 13.2%, with 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which accounted for a significant proportion.

Next year in the U.S. without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility of the US-Hungary visa waiver agreement coming into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister discussed this in Chicago with Hungarian representatives there.
In his view, 'it is now up to the transatlantic electronic entry and control system to be built in time'.
He also stressed that the new system would not allow for entry permits, but that tourists would have to register before departure.
The Hungarian foreign minister will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, whom he will present with the Order of the Star of the Hungarian Republic and hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also come out in support of the bailout of the banks.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major party presidential candidates, pledged their support on Sunday for the government's $700 billion bailout of banks, but some politicians are calling for the Treasury secretary to resign.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after days of marathon negotiations announced Sunday night that they had reached an agreement in principle on a bank bailout.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to unlock the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove they're better than their rivals at getting the country out of the recession.
According to the latest polls, with the economic issues in the foreground, Obama has regained some of his lead, while McCain's lead, gained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president, has dissipated.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps to protect consumers which he himself had supported.
"Now we must act responsibly . . . , the danger threatens your jobs, your savings, all industries, the entire economic stability", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain said in an interview with ABC that "we're all going to have a hard time bringing this down . . . but doing nothing is not a viable path".
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a committee to oversee the finance minister and limiting the exit of top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the deal, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi reported Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press release from the German-speaking world
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-conscious - Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian Socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was achievable exactly ten years ago ended: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, the first time it had fallen below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 during the period of the aforementioned Stoiber.
This is because of the consistent modernization of the region, which is devouring the parents.
The socialists predicted this 40 years ago, but they were very wrong about the time, but the secularization, the educational results, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not be left without consequences for the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classical bourgeois groups themselves have moved away from the CSU: the free professionals, the artisans, the graduates and the graduates.
Here, support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused domestic political situation in Austria created as a result of the elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate broadcast on public television the party leaders have just shown their cards.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ president, has confirmed his willingness to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to work together between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As you have stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any event.
The repetition of this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer has been cautious about the red bids.
As you said, the cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open question in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ repeated that he is open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing", Haider said.
Járóka: Breaking the cycle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris the European Summit on Equal Opportunities began, organised this year by France, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, MEP for Fidesz of the European People's Party, in her message to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress drew attention to segregation in schools as the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was attended by governments, European social partners and representatives of the main European civil society and equal opportunities organisations.
Járka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, recalled that apart from discrimination in recruitment, Roma are being excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low education.
"Most young Roma do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor quality primary education, only a small number of them can obtain a higher education qualification".
Járóka also stressed the key role of education in the promotion of human rights as a fundamental human right.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The earlier a Roma starts school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid on income and consumption they contribute to the national budget.
'The right of Roma to European citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-quality and segregated schools,' stressed Lívia Járóka.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
'The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe,' she said.
In the context of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, is to provide a single forum for promoting the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at national and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the election defeat, the Bavarian CSU leadership has postponed the discussion of personal issues.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in office, the question is how long the mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss, will be decided at the party's special congress on the last weekend of October.
The two politicians who have been heavily criticised have made it clear that they are not being attacked with all their might.
They tried to soften the anger of the members of the parliamentary group and the grassroots that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" they demanded personal consequences for losing the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union won 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU has been the absolute monarch of Bavaria for 46 years, which accounts for 18% of Germany's GDP.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
As the first sign of reorganization within the party, the vice-president and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible successor to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors, who are advocates of right-wing values for an eventual government coalition in Munich.
For a strange twist of fate, the list of Free Electors includes Gabriele Pauli, whose attitude against Stoiber was used as an opportunity for a coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple to then treat the woman with big ambitions with disdain.
CSU leadership is now focusing all their efforts on somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
The former regional governor and former CSU president called 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some unpopular statements towards the CSU, saying they deserved more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to hold the office of chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is rebuilt with common forces.
According to Merkel, who is not hiding her disappointment at the fiasco, the loss of CSU ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
The problem is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats is still going on.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria at 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110 to 0
Not a single opposition representative has entered the Belarusian parliament since Sunday's election.
Russian observers say it is a sign of the prosperity and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, while the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) says it is due to fraudulent vote counting.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition grouping under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) had serious hopes that Lukashenko, with a presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment in the disputed 2006 elections, would "grant" some seats in parliament to opposition representatives.
The SDG has thus abandoned a boycott which had been previously considered.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which demanded a loan to reduce its increasingly expensive Russian natural gas imports and agreed to give the Russians Beltransgaz's pipelines that run through the country, intended to improve relations with the EU where Lukashenko and other senior politicians cannot enter due to the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
He referred to a relaxation in which the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed the emphasis on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the ban on one third of the opposition candidates running.
But Monday's OSCE report also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually unable to appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, the opposition says there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is even willing to engage in a small confrontation with Moscow by continuing to deny Georgia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two countries independent for a month already.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "the government was afraid to let even one opponent into a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results but rather tries to get the message to voters that economic reforms are needed.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the most officially supported section, the pensioners, do not consider the Lukashenko regime adequate which considers its main achievement the creation of social security.
Due to the country's debt and the growing economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security system "reminiscent of the grave silence" breaks down, Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have judged the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
"From now on, breakfast before work".
Never before in the history of Chigi Palace have there been revolving doors for employees to enter and exit.
But starting today, he's starting this new policy against the clever, against the punching and then going to the bar for coffee during work hours.
The new anti-cannibalism measure was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors", says Brunetta, "are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services", the minister says.
"Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening.
This is reformism", Brunetta emphasises.
The installation of the Chigi Palace in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was cooperation from all".
I mean, no more breakfast during work hours, no more coffee and cornet.
In the words of Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In the case of Rome, the minister then reports that 'in three months, sickness absences by public employees have fallen by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people at work in a year'.
He adds that it is necessary to make the public administration more efficient
The Minister explained that the Italian economy was "developing at a pace where the wage dynamics have been twice as high as in the private sector over the last 8-10 years and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by joining the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Works is now flagging down figures on fewer sick days", says the consumer association, "the population of 'working drunks' is growing.
In fact, thousands of honest and productive public servants in Italy have united to declare war on the illegitimate regulations contained in the decree".
In particular, the TAR will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatment for sickness dependent on service; the extension of the availability periods for sick workers, within which follow-up visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the Minister.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the safety of workers is not compromised.
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, killing 3 people and leaving 27 permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirms that white deaths were about 1,200.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains a leading cause of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicide.
In order to draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the ANMIL is celebrating in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, instituted on the second Sunday of October.
'The worrying data published by the ANMIL and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,' says President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a message to the president of the ANMIL, National Association of Workers with Disabilities, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "deep appreciation for the association's continuing commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness".
"There has been an outcry, of course, and a sincere 'enough' in the face of tragedies that, because of their scale, have attracted the attention of the media and public opinion, but the daily reality is that we are faced with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics".
Mr Napolitano said: 'There is also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school field to raise awareness more directly among young people entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is necessary to keep the phenomenon alive, not to be alarmed by its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
The Commission is also proposing that the Commission should be given a mandate to carry out a study on the effects of the new measures on the environment.
"The figures on accidents at work seem to show a slight upturn, but that does not change the fact that the number of white deaths is still impressive", said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'downward trend' to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that overall too little is still being done to combat the phenomenon of accidents and that action can be taken through a number of means.
We believe that more controls and inspections are needed, but also more training for workers, starting with schools.
'More work needs to be done to inform and raise public awareness,' he added.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
Mr Mercandelli also denounced the "progressive deterioration in the levels of compensation protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistance drift towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker", he added, "so that the fate of the injured person does not depend on spontaneities or the occasional donation provided by the legislator".
MP3 players are under indictment, endangering hearing
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a statement released in Brussels quotes the opinion of the EU's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSERH), published today.
"This scientific opinion shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day with the device held at a high volume are at risk of permanent hearing loss", says the report.
"I worry that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high noise levels may unknowingly damage their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
'The scientific evidence shows a clear risk and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology.'
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the high use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
'Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine with Member States and stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and related equipment.'
There is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
This damage can be greatly reduced by solutions such as reducing noise exposure levels and duration.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment who listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the currently applicable limits for maximum noise permitted in the workplace.
People who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods of time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after a period of five years.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of such equipment and their number can be quantified as between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno starts the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which has taken up its seat this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bulletin" of the Capitol and its mayor, Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented", Alemanno stresses.
There is no overlap of roles, only the desire to have a place to work out a big project for Rome.
It will finish its work in March and then dissolve, because this experiment must have a definite time limit.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as it is in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure it is in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
Too often politics is crushed by the daily management and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further away, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future".
The mayor of Rome also emphasises that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro and it will serve to reason and involve the best minds that the capital expresses".
Germanos view is that "we need a strategic reference plan, not closed or immobile, to enable our city to make a real leap forward, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
A future which, the mayor of Rome said, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital but "also in terms of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician who likes to pass us off as independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy with his decisions and had relations (as he still does today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam".
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election day approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big, tough face: he thinks he's going to win the highest office in a nation that has had a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president?
Again, some speak with their heart but not their brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: Once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
It brings out a side of the American mentality that's been kept covered up to the last detail.
"Say what you want, and we'll figure out where to put the crossword, whether it's Obama or McCain".
Some people swear, if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things never said before, which seems almost certain to be the black candidate's success.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure, and 89 percent said Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet Iraq for most was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge job to do.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also being felt by journalists, who are cutting back on newspapers, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control as far as the future is concerned.
Well, most journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly declare that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a broken business model.
And the cuts in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the papers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the general public is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives believe that national journalism is going down the wrong path.
In the local area the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are opening up a gateway to the Internet, seen by many as the "killer" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between the people who run the newsrooms -- that is, the editors -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationally are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
This is why some have to do with "job security".
Executives who think they'll lose their jobs in three years are at 47 percent nationwide.
For staff reporters, it's going to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge country like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
Editors are almost always paid a large salary, while the editor may earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
The reasoning for the holidays is complicated: all days after the first year, all days after the third year, to 15 days in total after a number of years.
But American journalists, they admit, often get "sick" during the year.
It's all about the weather.
The Commission has not yet decided on the application of the new rules.
The president of the second criminal division of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be allowed to move from his home town, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl back-up investigation.
During the trial, last week, he obtained his release from house arrest and was made a resident of Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
The court, however, said that these moves (which the PM has ruled against) would allow him to influence his company and gain access to the evidence against him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon was already evident a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday confirmed that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old, moderate East Coast soul, which is pro-federal institutions and pro-business, and its new, conservative soul, which is hostile to those in Washington and the financial world, strong especially in the Midwest and South.
The soul, in fact, which has been made all the more alive by the vow I mentioned at the beginning.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
In both the United States and Europe the crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of long-incubated phenomena which in the new climate are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualisation, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of State-sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have, yes, close links with the outside world, but which are primarily concerned to a very large extent with the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one State.
Which immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: namely how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, by the way, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the picture or to have little say: the European Union, divided as usual between different interests and different national strategies, is a clear example of this.
And so it is from the governments of each individual country that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you come to a crisis only the countries have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources to try to put things right.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization will ever have to an equal extent.
This new emphasis on the national-statutory element is also in perfect harmony with the growing importance which recent economic developments tend to attach to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the net, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will have to deal increasingly with those very little intangible things which are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look at it, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are still absolutely bound to a limited space, to a territory.
So the one who happens to be the ruler of it certainly has a lot more cards than the one who is not, the one who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news, which, however, presages a break.
When you say Territory, State, Government, you inevitably say Politics, and therefore Leadership.
The economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena in this respect.
On the one hand, the recognition of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the need for someone who can take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discrediting of existing leadership, economic leadership, which has proved so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together with something even deeper and somewhat disturbing: a discredit, an impatience, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
It is a question of the fact that the European Parliament has not yet been able to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the European Parliament is able to take part in the negotiations.
The demand for leadership, in short, underground feeds a broad but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "electoral revolts" or sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the rise of conservatism in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, some would say, are making it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not today taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, potentially agitating to an excess.
In the face of all this, it would be frankly an exaggeration to call a 'mass revolt' on the agenda.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The Superglue to Walk on Walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It's the focus of several American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
Using a sticker that is only one inch [2.5 cm] square, researchers have been able to glue a 100-pound [100 kg] body to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY  The American journal Science published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the team of scientists invented is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
The principle of glue can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have taken inspiration from the geckos' paws, which are covered with microscopic hairs that ensure a perfect grip on the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, Teflon, and foil, showed that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "easily detaches from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as a connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
 The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, researchers in California presented a hair-like microfiber adhesive that self-cleans itself of dust as it moves on a surface to maintain a perfect grip at all times.
Medicines: never with fruit juices
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, alter the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, increasing or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the case, with serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has issued a new warning at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, stressing the risks of packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with certain medicines.
Grapefruit juice had already come under fire for allegedly increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine, and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
DANGEROUS MEDICINES - The Italian Drug Agency itself reported on this in a newsletter two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to be careful what they drink if they are taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
PURPLE - Not ONLY - Experts say that orange juice and apple juice also contain drugs-inhibiting substances.
Long list of inhibited active ingredients in grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something you are not clear about, do not impress yourself but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification, the expert at the Ansa agency stressed.
The Nobel Prize in economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade patterns and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron was failing, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked much controversy and for years was repeated to the economist, but now has proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "highly valued economist" but also a publicist with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism".
Open Office, here is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
It's the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, with SUN Microsystem as its backbone, the new Open Office is presented to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the revised and less spartan interface, as well as more substantial features such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention is also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some specific features of some modules are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by e-mail, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine typical Adobe graphics with elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene in multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the text editor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functionality to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace on request.
And if the theme of free of charge can be a trigger for the spread in homes, it is precisely in the business field that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
There is also a shortage of companies offering training, consultancy and assistance services which are ideal for small and mediumsized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emulating presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now at almost 3.6 million, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also tested positive for doping.
Another positive case at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third placed and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported by the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is part of a series of tests carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the test results confirm Cera's positive, the Austrian will lose his third place at the Tour and face two years of canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl's positive test for third-generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber jersey.
Immigrants: New York Times asks, is Italy racist?
Italy "has only recently changed from a country of emigrants to a preferred destination for immigrants" who are reluctantly welcomed.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? is the question raised in a long article in the New York Times which devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what Nyt calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both where "more integration and more jobs" are recorded but also where "the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League are recorded".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation that the League wants to tighten the brakes on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Students victimized by high-rent prices up to 900 euros per room
The university rental market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, a student can rent a single room for up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now become so serious that whole groups of young people are excluded from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families of origin should bear", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia studies office.
In most cases, the lease offers contain a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no limit on the fee, linked sub-leases.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, about 450 euros are needed; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, a double bed costs 250/280 euros, while a single bed costs 370-500 euros.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are charged for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower prices (550 euro for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only savings are made by moving to the outskirts: 300 euros for one bed and 450 euros for a single bed in the Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room costs 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, a bed costs 250-350 euros, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater impact on the city economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% in the fee charged to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, the cities are erasing historic halls
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the emergence of large multi-screen cinemas in the outskirts and the consequent death of single-screen cinemas in the central areas of cities, is one of those events which seem inevitable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
"It's like losing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a road and many emotions", says the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Jury 20 years ago, and which told the story of the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for a way of living cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by ANAC, the main association of the exhibitors, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the main losers are the cinemas in the main cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is the region most affected by the closures, with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the main cause of their disappearance is the advent of multiplexes, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
The Italian exercise has developed irrationally observes Paolo Protti, president of ANAC, "it is useful to build new facilities but the survival of existing ones should be ensured, because when a town hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the multiplexes.
The Commission has also taken a number of measures to ensure that the market is not affected by the new rules.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the existing laws.
Between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year would be needed to support the sector.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to take refuge in the closures by signing a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-screen cinemas in the historic centre and in the outskirts.
The rules include tax incentives for operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking and parking fees.
It is an initiative I like observes Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by putting in place other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the overwhelming power of multiplexes traditional theatres must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
Defending traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, to avoid seeing the black signs of dust I turn the other way.
Political ties and arrests of the mayor of Tauro Joy
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the choices of the City Council with the interests of the Piromalli area".
The charges brought by the Magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria against the Mayor and Vice-Mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, the lawyer, the boss' namesake, who was already convicted of association for mafia-type delinquency, were also in handcuffs.
"In defiance of any legal or moral norms, as well as common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay Piromalli for legal advice.
"It would have allowed the coffin", the judges wrote, "to enter officially into the municipalities, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional council, Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that "collusions between local authorities and organized crime are common" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean".
This morning's arrests follow those of last July when police announced they had beheaded the Piromalli bodyguard.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and again because of alleged complications between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called in then-Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli squad had even come to ask for the change of the A3 project.
The environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, showed "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group known to be close to the Piromalli, aligning the choices of the public administration with the interests of the region".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones come in.
It's an endless field, covering over 70% of the planet's surface and now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources they've set their sights on, and now they're trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of deriving energy from the movement of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in the 1980's, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now environmental concerns and the new rise in oil are giving the industry a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by offshore wind farms.
This would be twice as much as is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossal in the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy and among these companies have always been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for a company affiliated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering working with us".
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit from the US Energy Commission for a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is a good sign, especially when you consider that the United States is still drilling for oil in Alaska and that President Bush recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are taking the sea energy route and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be perfected.
Experts say it is a technology in its infancy, partly because marine energy is not without its environmental impact.
For now, plants like the one in Portugal or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to be causing major problems for the ecosystem.
But large-scale energy production requires technologies with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The wave force that moves the buoys up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through undersea cables.
There are four such plants currently in the planning stages, pending federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the turbine blades to spin, creating a rotational motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to use the power.
After the waves, the tides.
The potential of tides is of particular interest, say the Electric Power Research Institute.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that face the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are planning to invest up to $35 million in 2009.
