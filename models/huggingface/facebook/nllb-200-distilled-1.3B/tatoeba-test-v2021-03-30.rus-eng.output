Let's get out of the cab.
He was a sed.
Tom never skipped school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom is drinking apple juice.
Are you going to take the train?
We think so, too.
How could something like this happen?
You're actresses.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and feet are always cold.
How do you translate words that don't exist in any language but mine?
Could you tape this up?
I'm going to go home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in traffic.
Tom is very angry with me.
I used to wash my hair only once a week.
Eleven is a prime number.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Coffee's on me.
We're husband and wife.
The Jacksons have invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
In October, the leaves begin to fall.

What's upsetting you?
I'm too busy to talk to you right now.

Where are you handing out the screwdriver?

Praise be to Allah!
Do you think Tom knows?
I'm gonna pay for this one.
Tom acted like a child.
Stop singing.
There were only six people at the party.
What's your decision?
I didn't know you were a romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do it now.
The robber entered the house through this door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have a confession to make.

I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran. I'm not going anywhere.
"Do you speak Greek?" "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy something for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We have to respect their wishes.
How did you talk her into it?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best to make sure that we're okay.
Would you buy one of these?
Tom will be late for his plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the back of the audience.
You'll live.
What did she buy at that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He came hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did that.
I would buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is near our school.
These are cookies I baked for you.
England is similar to Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
That dog's bark wouldn't scare a child.
Don't try to resist.
Tom has the keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the mountains to cheer me up.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do everything he wants to do.
Tom doesn't often tell us jokes.
Onions can be used in many dishes.
There's hardly any snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
The tree was struck by lightning.
Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened the latch.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Will Tom go with you?
Where's the remote?
I can't find her either.
You speak Swedish.
Did you see anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't answer the phone.
Tell Tom to stay out of sight.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I'm exhausted. I work from morning to night.
What time do we leave?
It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going to happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch cold.
He aimed at the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, my God!
I have to move on.
She pressed her nose against the glass.
In English, there is no difference between ser and estar.
I know exactly what I have to do.
He's very secretive.
Your English is excellent.
Do you have any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Texting while driving is very dangerous.
Tom said that Mary agreed.
Tom said that Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The fork was broken.
Why don't you go kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Tom to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to explain himself to me.
I was very calm.
Everybody has something to hide.
We're having some guests tonight.
Her voice still rings in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals all things.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the chance.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told Tom that you came to Australia.
You were looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where do I expect you?
I was really worried about you.
What'd you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught in a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What have we got to lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop being a fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm up the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that's not how Mary does it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather like?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not going to introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was willing to do it.
She cried.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the manager of Tom.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which is better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the animals from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You're just like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette, please.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this film.
There's a phone call.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't get enough of your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much taller than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on the birth of his son.
Mary says she needs more time.
Tom stepped away from the door.
My dad is an English teacher.
Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle for Christmas.
Hold on to the railing.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
How many glasses are on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she's innocent.
I suppose so.
I don't like Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom recently got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
I did!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom has already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can you use the vicious circle in a proof and get a high rating for it.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they just stared at me.
Should I go?
I was stupid enough to believe that.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll get it for you.
It's ten o'clock, my mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
Owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom is still out of work.
We're perfect for each other.
French is difficult, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger is over.
We need more firewood.
Tom said that Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris is far?
What time is it in Tokyo?
He said he was looking forward to seeing you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming today.
You'll understand when you're a father.
I saw you and Tom last Monday.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it'll snow this year at Christmas?
How was Tom's party?
I need to use the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like to have a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't get a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
I have to pay all the bills.
She clapped.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom is dragging Mary by the hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom eats sushi regularly with his mother.
We forgot to sign in!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the laziest person I know.
Has Mary cleaned her room yet?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a sober man.
Alvaro is from Venezuela.
Here's the check.
He insulted me in public.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why can't I stay with you?
In induction cookers, magnets are used to heat pots and pans directly.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombone.
Get out of here now.
Can I see your license?
I'll charge you 1,000 pesetas to replace the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
What a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom baked pancakes.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much is this?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to tend the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about 180 grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You are stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom at 2:30.
He likes it that way.
Tom knew that Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Has anyone else noticed that?
This sentence is not in English.
I think Tom is kind.
She played a sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
The infection's in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
You'll thank me one day.
Tom watches TV sometimes.
I'm ready to go?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still not thinking straight.
Run, you chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You're getting on my nerves!
I think we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until after 2:00 a.m.
Mary was not thirsty.
Tom wasn't as hard to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
She seems to be in good health.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Watch your little sister.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to go.
Have you had dinner?
I like bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympics.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom is winning.
I don't know what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're all dirty.
I didn't know it was impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Did it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?
Does Tom speak French?
He learned Russian when he was young.
Put that back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We haven't discussed this.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the newspaper on the table.
What'd you find out?
Weather permitting, we will climb to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complicated it seemed.
His gray eyes sparkled and sparkled, and his usually pale face came alive and blushed.
What kind of pizza do you like best?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Have some more.
I'm looking for my passport. Have you seen it?
His hands are blue from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Can anyone here speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Tom has the power.
I learned to practice and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to accuse you.
I'm not busy at all right now.
Children like to play more than they like to study.
He was mistaken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm speaking.
Tom thinks Mary is in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking politics.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid of a fight.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go, now!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom isn't used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Is a mustache suddenly in style?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You are sad.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom is wearing a pirate suit.
That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't you ask me?
Tom has to be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We're proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a mailman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald the Blue-Toth, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Tom never saw Mary after that.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
Tom likes to read Hermann Hesse.
To tell you the truth, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases come before a court, it is common for a jury to consist of twelve people.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized that something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
Another day has passed.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He was hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, hurry up! We're going to be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is world famous for its hamburgers.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock is broken.
A diamond is a precious stone.
Have some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's going to be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice encountered, waiting for an answer, was a sudden howl, a loud noise so sharp as to tear her eardrums and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He'll answer as he pleases.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me these beautiful flowers is your sister.
Well, isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the kids?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I'm learning is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president rules for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have on you?
Could you answer that question?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
The building is twenty stories.
If you're not going, I'm not going.
Do you happen to know when Tom is coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you hold on a second?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She's not gonna fire him.
I know you work with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as a mule.
I think I can count on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl answered the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom that you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom might be interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom has small whiskers.
Did you understand what she said?
You're a little distracted.
Don't get mad at her.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything is fine.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom has to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on other people's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're already done.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept to him; he always had enough to eat.
The auditorium needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know that existed.
He's left-handed.
I was poisoned.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
He looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
Can you spare a minute? I want to discuss something important to both of us.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do this again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom lit the flashlight and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Tom walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't stop thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I cried.
Don't you want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
Milk can be used to make butter, cheese, and many other things.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, remember who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
You behave yourself.
You like jazz, right?
You are drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked in response.
Tom said that Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Did you ever think about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in an avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll take care of this.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
That's one spit.
I really liked this book.
You are important.
When ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay overnight.
Tom didn't tell the policeman his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was in pain.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl was wearing a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was fooled.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who is Tom playing with?
I need a light coat.
I've completed my mission.
It's a cat.
Please tell me that's not true.
You're not coming in?
I fixed his radio.

She felt deep regret as she looked back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I nodded in agreement.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but easy to lose.
Stop acting like a child!
Let's get out of here.
They start believing their own lies.
Don't pick him up.
Tom wants to dye his hair.
I've never seen her here before.
Why should I work with Tom?
I think it was your fault.

Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom is still angry.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I know.

I respect his views, even though I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied his sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after 9:00?
You don't have to go.
Put him on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using it, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long do you plan on staying?
We ate quickly and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The cage was open.
I brought wine.
I'm not popular.
It's his first day at school.

I told him I was wrong.
I am a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It had to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you like to eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do that or not.
I'm going down.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
She learned to ride a bike last year.
Help us out here.
You don't have to thank me.
Because it was winter, he didn't go out.

This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing short of a miracle.
She's my age.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is free.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That's gonna have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a mild climate.
Check it again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced an injured player.

I don't think Tom is lost.
I was about to leave when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with this.
Always give way to obstacles on the right.
We're being asked to identify ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
You still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I really don't have a lot of time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to be sorry about.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melodious siren song to me.

Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you have to do this often?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For the love of God, stop!
Nothing like a nice beer after a long day at work.

You're just stating the obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the ones who caused this.
He's as accurate as a clock.

I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.

The best defense is an attack.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I'm not following you.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do for you?
You got that?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you gonna be ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the seizure of a computer file of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.

You're gonna pay for what you did.
I'm getting a little out of hand today.
I asked them to stay out of it.
Tom only learned to drive at the age of thirty.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my feather knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon be settled into the country life.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
You're not a kid anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
This is the deepest river.
I thank you with all my heart.
I've told you a hundred times.
I'm very cold.

He sells cars.
Are you still in contact with her?

There must be some mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.

How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's cut to the chase.
Tom was sitting on the steps.

Sometimes lightning strikes twice in the same place.
I'm not bragging.
Save it for later.

I'd like to return to Tokyo by way of Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't already know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom was the last to leave.
Tom signed the petition.
Have you tried talking to Tom about this?

How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
I see now.
Give me some time.
You want them to help?
Tom is nowhere to be seen.
I'm the one who told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We may meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me.
He's a coward.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me posted.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Mary told me she would buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps for forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bike for your birthday.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think Tom will like that.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said it was yours.
Tom is busy with his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced from my wife.
This is extremely interesting.
Don't stay up late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody having fun?
