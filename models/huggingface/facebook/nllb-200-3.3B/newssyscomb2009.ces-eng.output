The right-wing populists in Austria have won 29% of the vote.
A marked weakening of both sides of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have, according to the first preliminary results, brought the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of current chairman Wilhelm Molterer being seriously shaken.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Bund for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korut-based Heitman Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it is losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
The ÖVP, which is losing almost nine percent of the vote, has suffered an even worse loss with 25.6 percent.
It's the worst result of both these major parties in post-war Austrian history and especially for the Luddites who called the early election, a disastrous result.
In early July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the populists had a considerable lead in preferences over the SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was voiced about the possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party's leadership.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the still most likely outcome of the election result, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP grand coalition.
With the strengthening of the right wing of the two populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) gaining 18 percent and the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also expressed their fear of a repeat of 1999, when the populists and the populists (at that time the FPÖ were still united, but in 2005 they split from the BZÖ) agreed on a joint government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
This is clearly the case with Haider, who has already declared his readiness to cooperate with any party and envisages a return to Vienna to the national policy.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but lost easily and fell from third to fifth place among Austria's political parties.
None of the other parties clearly crossed the four percent threshold and entered Parliament.
Relations with India may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists accused of illegally collecting beetles in India had not been solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg said that the Czech-Indian relations would have cooled somewhat.
The minister said this in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it wasn't resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling off", he said after the meeting, which was held on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive branch can hardly interfere in judicial matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Peter Svácka, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjeeling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls within.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
Sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said the best thing for Emil Kucher would be to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and await sentencing in custody, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement at the hearing.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved in the matter is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian side is already providing such assistance.
"We have a vested interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the CTU said, he emphasised to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists", he said.
Asked whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister avoided answering.
"I've had enough promises", he said.
The Czech Republic is judging the sea bottom fight
He accesses a wall-mounted electronic map of Australia and its surrounding marine areas.
But he's not interested in a continent, he's interested in a tiny dot lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself", says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of a 30-member team working for the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
His boss, the division's director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally adds to it.
It's all about work and enthusiasm.
The seabed is a world of little known resources.
Oil, ore, and other minerals are found here, as are previously unknown living organisms that hold the key to developing a cure for cancer.
Bottom larger than the mainland
The coastal states now began to compete vigorously for new undersea territory.
They are exercising their rights under the United Nations Convention, which they signed in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
This is especially true of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends for hundreds of miles off the coast of a country.
It has an exclusive claim to all resources on the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its substrate that is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the 200 nautical mile limit of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by a country to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly surveys and measurements.
It's the result of years of preparation.
'One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical expertise.
The Commission has so far examined five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three of the latter countries have succeeded so far", adds Mikulka.
Worldwide attention has recently been drawn to the success of Australia, the first country to expand its submarine states substantially.
But he also got New Zealand - the area of the seabed the commission gave him last week is about a million square miles, about six times the size of the country itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The future benefits of exploiting the seabed, they promise, will be invaluable.
Other States will gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for up to ten years after they ratify the Montego Bay Treaty.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, a region declared by the convention to be "the common heritage of mankind".
No state is exclusive here anymore.
The right to extract in this area is granted by the international institutions established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a Klondike", enthusiastically says Director Mikulka, adding that its "individual areas are clearly defined by law and their regime is contractually enshrined".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other former Eastern Bloc countries in the joint organisation 'Interoceanmetal'.
In 1991, the latter, like investors from a few other countries, obtained the status of 'pioneer investor' under the Convention.
It has a permit to mine in the Clarion Clipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it's some kind of underwater replica of the Tater.
"It has a total surface area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian worker Rober Sandev brings one such specimen to the fore.
It resembles a small potato or, if you fancy it, a fabled schem that, according to legend, brought the Golem to life.
German special forces were involved in the rescue of the hostages
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in the hostage crisis - experts arrived.
When the situation escalated, special units were ready, but no deployment took place.
More details are gradually being released about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists who were kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces are also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, the liberation site was visited by both specialists from the Federal Army and members of the German GSG9 counter-terrorism police, the Federal Police squadron, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
According to a further statement by spokesmen for both ministries on Monday afternoon, however, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their captives go and escaped when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the German offer of aid as a back-up force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, it did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19, a group of travelers - five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman, and eight of their Egyptian companions - were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
After being abducted in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were moved to the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as did the details of their release or possible ransom payment.
At present, the rescued are safe in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the hostages are in the care of the German embassy.
He didn't comment on the details of the release.
There is no information yet in Berlin about when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists are expected to leave, with special forces, on one of the German Air Force's Airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the bailout package
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly voted to drop a $700 billion bailout of financial markets.
The Dow Jones has plummeted.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial-market bailout.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, a program to ease the chaos in financial markets has not been found by the majority.
In a dramatic move, the proponents desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, challenged the House to vote in favor of the bill before the vote, even though, as he put it, the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political approval for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones fell more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was investors' fears that the state rescue package might fail.
Shortly before the vote, the index rose, only to fall sharply again after the announcement of the shipwreck.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The program requires the approval of both the House and the Senate to become effective.
Travel agents record increasing numbers of reservations
It looks like winter is going to be good for German tourism business:
According to one study, bookings for the coming months increased dramatically compared with the previous year - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic growth, the German desire to travel remains intact.
For winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the market research institute GfK, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
According to the DRV, the turnover in October was thus about 11% higher than in 2007.
The figures are based on figures from GfK, which analyses the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them with the overall market.
This result included bookings for tours made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar, there is a demand for travel to the US, DRV said.
On these roads, the increase in reservations is about one-third.
Besides, the Germans are especially keen on Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
In particular, organised tours are in order, said the chairman of the DRV, Klaus Laepple.
With increasing energy and food costs, the costs are "easier to calculate for the client than for an individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by, among other things, using early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so that the turnover will be higher again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated drinking, beer from the tuppat and prominent in the outfits of famous designers.
First time on the beer garden.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have that much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV host and wears a tailored suit.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing we have in common: we've been in the beer garden for less than three minutes, and already we're being bombarded by photographers and flash cards are filling up fast - which is flattering, since this is my first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you can be friends.
Looks like my cheap cut served its purpose.
I'm a tourist here, and I live north of the equator, so my sense of comfort in the cut was rather limited.
But as soon as we arrive at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman's dress or leather pants; no one looks at each other in disgust or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The strange views at the chocolate banana stand are only harvested by my apron.
A Munich woman warns me that I've tied her wrong: "On the left you're free, in the middle a virgin, on the right a married woman, behind a widow".
I'm secretly shifting my left arm from the back.
"Okay", he says, and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques are not so busy, wearing simple felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and poking at passing naked butts.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an extended "ooh".
That's what he tells me after he's relieved from a freshly drunk slush.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the feared "Wildbiesler", as they call people who urinate freely in public in Bavaria.
Others don't have the good fortune to get rid of alcohol that way.
At about 8:00 p.m., the Oktoberfest grounds are swarming with paramedics who have to take care of the poor drunks.
The medics always appear in flocks - four-nosed carriers that move from tent to tent.
They're like most visitors to the beer garden: empty there, full back.
Who lies beneath the shroud of this coffin of the dead is not to be seen.
"Those who can't go on", one of the paramedics called in response to my question, and disappeared into the crowd.
Police have released the name of the victim of the accident
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex has been released.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon happened to Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A man in his 50s has been arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was already out on police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding
Long before Turkey began to seek membership in the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into Turkish territory.
On the eastern shore of the Bosporus, perhaps only twenty paces from Asia, stands one of the finest monuments to this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
Hydarpaşa railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Konu in a Neo-Renaissance style.
I mean, that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building sits perpendicular to the end of the platform with towers at each corner of the facade, overlooking the unrecognizable view from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you get inside the vaulted treasury, you can no longer doubt the size of the establishment whose westernmost gateway was the station.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, was intent on realizing its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and on to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And for Hydarpasa station, there was bad news too.
In 1917, an explosion on an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been gradually drilled and history has bypassed it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and beyond serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from surrounding territories created by the frozen borders of the Cold War is gone.
Now the new policy applies - Turkey is involved.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading experts on foreign policy, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a whirlwind ride on tracks that resembled the old-world rhythms of the famous documentary The Night's Mail, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, with its well-known Islamist roots, the AKP represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
She's aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shophouses and power-hauling shops, where middle managers in business suits - men and women - meet to do their early morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its perimeter.
Today, he must look east and west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It had to do both.
"But there will surely come a time", I asked, "when Turkey may have to make a decision?"
"Turkey", he said, "you didn't want to have to make that decision".
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost by heart: that Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are as much in Europe's and the United States' interests as Turkey's.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go east on these tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasa station, after another mostly sleepless night, I thought of the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who had watched this building being built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that European ambitions in the Middle East may now be, in substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And as I was waiting in the harbor for the ferry back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least back then there wasn't much doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating land.
Memorable lives of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's music director from 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
As part of the district's music program, he founded the Proteus Youth Choir that year.
It was supposed to be until the age of 21, but by the time Proteus sang his last song in 1979, there were a few of us in our 30s - we just refused to give up on the choir.
The name "Proteus" (a mythological shape-shifter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to engage in any music that was presented to it - be it madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility created by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, all thanks to the inspiration of that one man and his passion for music, which remained absolutely unchanged throughout.
How many times did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Then sing it!"
His drumming was perfectly clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the standard of music was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I have been inspired by many.
Todd Handley had such a wonderful combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "pull one or two dirty pegs around the world".
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary, William Woodruff (September 25th) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman... while studying for his BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's author notes in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a dissertation on the British Rubber Industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of The British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff abandoned this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamenco and Life", because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was captivated by the simplicity and the power of the shot with which they impressed the audience, and the consideration and respect for the people they photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino has a way of capturing magical moments".
Honda strikes again with its bestseller
In the month of November, Honda will start selling the second generation of the Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-deck vehicle already had a considerable amount of space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
Added to this are improved engines that enhance ride comfort and allow for greater fuel economy.
It was evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz's lines are very similar to the previous model, many changes have been made to this one-seater.
These include innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we even explore the new model, it's worth noting that the new Jazz is coming to market six years after the first generation was launched.
So the first thing that we notice is that Honda took a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and again during 2008.
In Japan alone, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since the car was launched.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, is aiming to increase sales in its new Jazz segment.
So, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83 000 units of the Honda Jazz, in 2009 it is estimated that 100 000 cars will be sold, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects sales of 2,000 units for the whole year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
The company's management expects to end the year with a total of 22 000 units sold, 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door compact-size hybrid with a length of 14 feet [4.37 m] that the Japanese company promises to sell worldwide at a rate of approximately 200,000 units a year.
As for the markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of InSight will be sold in the United States, with the remaining percentage split between the old continent and Japan.
The Honda Insight is expected to go on sale in the first months of next year, once it is unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has been enlarged in every dimension.
Its length has increased to 12 feet [3.9 m] (by two inches [5 cm]), its width to 5 feet [1.69 m] (by two inches [2 cm]) and its wheelbase to 8 feet [2.5 m], an increase of two inches [5 cm].
The height, however, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions has also led to an increase in interior space.
These advantages were achieved by using a new platform and by placing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the cargo compartment - which has a double-bottom system - has increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first-generation cargo compartment.
It is noted that these dimensions are found in the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage compartment volume of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements besides the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping a panoramic glass roof - are easier access to the rear seats.
The door to the second row of seats allows an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 in the first Jazz model.
The second generation Honda Jazz has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower fuel consumption, lower CO2 emissions and delivers excellent improvements to the drive system while maintaining high torque in the full engine speed range.
The first, a 1.2-litre engine, has 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of the Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The new engine will produce 100 horsepower, compared with 83 in the previous generation.
The 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined 5.4 litre fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The "bee car" prevents the collision
To advance the development of crash-prevention technologies, Nissan took inspiration from nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has developed a robot that mimics the flight pattern of bees to prevent collisions.
This is the Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in crash prevention technology.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Center for Advanced Technology have developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Research in Science and Technology at Japan's prestigious University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhiro Doie, general director of public relations for the brand's technology, research and development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of the Nissan safety shield.
The robot is designed to enhance the collision-prevention capability of the vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, very similar to a Nissan safety shield.
Most important, though, are the bee's compound eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its own personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called a laser rangefinder.
It records obstacles up to two metres in the 180 degree radius before the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately translates it into a collision warning.
"Once an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheel at a right or even a right angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all the evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobile Lab and the project's chief engineer.
Unlike bees, a robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to two dimensions and the direction that its wheels allow it to move, but not in the infinite number of directions and possibilities of a bee.
So, in addition to accelerating and decelerating, Nissan also used a rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs every few seconds to process the information and act on it.
It requires no memory or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which allows it to operate without interruption with only two dozen kilobytes of memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about gigabytes or mega-gigabytes in memory".
This is the first step in the development of a new technology called instant collision avoidance, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars within a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to incorporate a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles in the road.
Enjoy the fear before you take the mortgage
It must be admitted that the U.S. Treasury, besides having the capital to administer the injections, has no shortage of ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking out risky mortgages with banks of dubious solvency, it created a popular online educational game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "the hotel of bad credit"... or the hotel of confusion.
The hotel and especially its receptionist seem to be so gloomy that you have to think once, twice, and three times about whether it's the right time to ask for a loan.
And most of all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is, the game contains useful information, although not in great detail.
It's more a youth-friendly site than a public space.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, a dream room appears.
Well, at least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley is opening up its MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley announced that it was going to take over Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, by issuing $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, and the news was accompanied by a sharp drop in its stock market value.
A week after revealing their tentative agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was planning to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a flat price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in convertible securities, which will yield a 10% return at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would be executed at an average unit price of $29 a share, 28 percent below its current price.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, fell 6.79% to $23.07 by 5pm GMT.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status", explained John Mack, the US group's CEO.
The new charter was approved by Morgan Stanley last week, which is supposed to allow it to diversify its activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest aces to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms of the deal, which were revealed on Monday, show that the deal has been altered over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought just a week ago", explained TOHISHIDE MIZUNO, MUFG's managing director in Tokyo, "that our participation would consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
Given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than their book value for Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings per share of about 20%.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into ordinary shares within one year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period at a price 50% above the exchange rate, i.e. at approximately USD 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash position.
However, the spokesperson of the group refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he's been "substantially" reducing his balance sheet since late August.
The last few weeks have been difficult for the Group, as its stock exchange rate has fallen by half, while the cost of insurance against the risk of default associated with debt has risen sharply.
These costs reversed on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other survivor of the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa is in Quito on Monday.
To re-establish the Republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to a vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of a new Constitution.
And his mission is accomplished, because 64% of the voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of ballots were blank.
For the Constitution to be adopted, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two exit polls and a poll by a non-governmental organization predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, with a range of 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa last night, from Sunday to Monday, claimed victory for his draft constitution.
"The Constitution has won on all fronts", he said congratulating the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa has received congratulatory messages from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in a calm manner according to the OAS observation mission, was on the text of 444 points that build the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution confers economic power on the state by reserving to it the "planning of development" of a country that lives primarily on oil extraction by foreign companies and on the foreign currency sent by its emigrants.
The Correia-backed bill, which was passed in 2006, also expands the powers of the head of state, who will be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms and will have the ability to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution, among other things, enshrines the principle of free health care and education, which the president has begun to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also includes a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending an agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a base for U.S. counter-narcotics operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando has kidnapped 11 tourists and their eight-member entourage, who were taken hostage ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts, who had been held captive in the desert for ten days, were safely transported to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
They were freed by Egyptian commandos in Chad during the morning.
The hostages arrived at about 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, aboard a special plane to the al-Maza military base, which is adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken, without a chance to speak to the press, by helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, for medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom was paid to the hostages", said Tourism Minister Zoheir Garrana on the runway.
Since their capture on September 19 during a four-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous agency, the safari organiser.
A senior Egyptian security official indicated that 30 members of the special forces, who had approached the site in two helicopters, had taken off during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled", said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He noted that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the Lightning unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, speaking from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by Italian special forces and secret agents.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our people in the intelligence community, in the special forces", he said without elaborating.
He also denied that a ransom was paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a four-wheel drive vehicle carrying the hijackers during a patrol, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two others.
The military claimed they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Army-Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - Silent Majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on funding for culture is filling the front pages of the newspapers and is the subject of the ongoing election campaign.
That's more like it.
One area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will stand up to launder the meagre sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national monuments that are starving?
What politician would dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and its historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors, it's written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American people, and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives, and all regional organizations, in a cooperative manner.
In Quebec, the Federation of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers organized into 211 historical, monumental, archival, and genealogical societies, strive to uncover history, preserve the accumulation of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a small fee.
Often these companies are the very heritage watchdogs that the hopeless hunters protest when promoters and leaders launch their bulldozers at old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When are we going to see the grandstands for history and monuments?
Benelux governments to state the part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to fall into trouble as a result of the spillover effect of the US mortgage market, by partial nationalisation: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which also has a capital participation in Hungary, with EUR 11.2 billion.
This was agreed at the highest level this weekend by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioners.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to have entered into a major crisis in the international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this case could be considered in some respects as precedents.
Under the decision that was born on Sunday night, all three countries will buy back almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its equity holdings, in particular the mainly insurance business acquired last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis Bank's stock began to plunge sharply last week, and by the second half of the week, the institution was already showing serious signs of crisis.
But analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to fail.
The company's stock fell 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value.
At current share prices, the group's total market capitalisation is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company's executives this is unrealistic.
The management blamed the Fortis stock crash on the uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the US plan of a package worth $ 700 billion.
The stock was up a little bit on Monday.
On Friday, the bank was appointed a new CEO, Filip Dierckx.
The Mint has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors need not worry, they will not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
The Fox in the Henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's purchase history, often dismiss the possibility of taking out a policy with an applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a data protection programme that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of an independent person, or we're giving the chicken to the fox", the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, author of the program designed to monitor prescribing.
Insurance companies make premiums and claims for accidents dependent on the health status of the person concerned and will not insure him if the risk is judged to be too great.
In the past, they would send the person to a medical examination and only contract with them if they knew the results.
A decade ago, Dick devised a much cheaper method: Using a pharmacy ID, a customer can easily see what medication he has purchased in the past year and a half, and the program itself can infer what disease he is suffering from and what his medical condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this indicates that he has virtually uncontrollably high blood-fat levels, which immediately places him in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also determine the risk coefficient, so that there is almost no work left for the insurance company except for the paperwork, although minor problems arise.
The advantages of these drugs are that they can be used for many purposes, some compounds are useful for migraines and hot flashes, for example, but they are also effective against depression.
These constitute a significant risk-increasing factor from the point of view of commercial insurers, whereas the former do not.
Special companies have been set up to collect and process data, and they ask the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
They are now forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their past negligence.
Some companies have recently been incorporating lab tests into their data, which they link to drug data, providing an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
As more companies gain access to data, it will become increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effect is limited to health service providers and insurance companies.
A bill that would give the government the power to control companies that specialize in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick recognises that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme in such a way that the transfer of data is subject to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is, that permission can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies won't sign him.
So chickens are just a little bit too attached to the fox of good will.
The global Marseille menu
European Union and India double turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's foremost trade partners, this theme was also high on the agenda of the ninth summit, alongside other, predominantly global issues.
Today, there will also be a French-Indian summit, focusing on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises India as a developing democratic power that should be given a greater say in international affairs, but the member states have so far failed to find common ground on supporting New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
The question was not even discussed further at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and agreed to double their trade turnover to more than 100 billion euros within five years.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In a sign of this, twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally harmonized, so that aviation also became green in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the EU's trade with India, which is the EU's largest trading partner, with New Delhi ranking ninth among EU partners.
The Summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism in all its forms, were condemned by both parties and called for the urgent convening of a UN conference.
They also marked the end of the Doha round of trade negotiations, although both have contributed greatly to its failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate agenda, aiming to reduce its emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the climate conference next year, to reach a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides are also keen to avoid rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to address the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will arrive in the French capital today where he is set to conclude a deal on the peaceful uses of atomic energy in a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the contracts for the construction of the nuclear reactors in India worth 20 billion euros will be awarded to French companies.
According to the agency's reports, the deal would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
A big participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to view, with Turkey as the guest of honor.
Deputy Minister for Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia)  on 264 square metres of exhibition space.
A meeting with the press will follow in the Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
The data show that the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production is decreasing, especially with regard to literature for children and adults.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane have been found, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert.
The remains were found on a plateau at an altitude of 10,000 feet in the Mammoth Lakes region of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson, has resolved the remaining doubts: "The plane has been found, we have sent a team, and we now have the certainty that it is the exact same plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he told a press conference.
The Sheriff's Office has confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The US Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) announced that a few hours after the wreckage was identified, an investigation team was dispatched and eventually identified the aircraft: it was a Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their residence in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name on them, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was suspended a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire earned a place in history by collecting long-term firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in a hot air balloon: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a plane, without landing.
Among his many records is a flight of 50,000 feet [15,445 m] over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, the commercial you don't expect
One unusual SUV with an original design and precisely defined contour lines, wide surfaces with precise angles.
This is, in short, the latest born of the "compact" Jeep house stars, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring a whirlwind of innovations to this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional design, the communication that accompanies the launch of the Suv Glock will be unexpected and unconventional, and it will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign that accompanies the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial communication method, thanks to a futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is being used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main commercial square, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and, with the help of special glasses to be distributed near Corsa Como, the new SUV will be able to be seen in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
In fact, if you look at the picture, you'll get the impression that the car is coming off the poster.
Then, using the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new GLC will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to then reassemble into a single image.
Mercedes is no doubt trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical automotive realm with this ad.
Will he succeed in this way in attracting the interest of future customers?
Now we know who the Italian hooligans are.
From Trivenet, they risked Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of today, part of the Ultras Italia group that has been watching the Azzurri for years and that, to tell the truth, has never caused any problems?
Ani has never met an opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right-wing.
The founders came from Trivenet.
From Verona, from Padua, from Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (actually, a few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-color flags with the names of the cities of origin of the participants: they were removed on Saturday night so that they could not be recognized.
They're inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found a real Nazi fan, Levsky.
Figc has made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all in name, so easy to check.
And Viminale actually checked them all: there was no one with Dasel running around in Sofia, no one who was banned from visiting the stadiums.
Four blue fans with prior stadium violations were denied entry and banned from the game.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the news that comes from the Bulgarian police, then takes action: In this case, Daspo can be given for five years at least to the fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which prohibits not only Italian stadiums, but all of Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, never set foot in a stadium again.
To your happiness.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, that there are more than 150 to be added.
"We must put out this fire now and not excuse those who behave in this way", Vimala confirms.
So, "Eyes wide open, especially for the national game in Lecha on Wednesday".
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, who can count on a part of AIS, it's the secret service that deals with problems in the stadiums.
"Chorus Leader-Leader and arms outstretched during Mameli's anthem?
This is the thought of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really unlucky way), who has been director of the Viminale Observatory for a few weeks (he has found the place that was previously Francesco Tagliente's and then Felice Ferlizzi's).
Mazzilli was previously the Quaestor of Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters is located, founded in 2002.
It's true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it's not a crime to celebrate the leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
"I'm not a sociologist", adds Osservatorská jedna. "Crimes are attributed to the country in which they occur.
So far, this group has been very limited, so we're going to take a hard look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about whistling the Mameli anthem: it is not a crime either, but if you will allow, it is impolite... "
