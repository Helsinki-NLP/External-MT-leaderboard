Right-wing populists win in Austria, 29 percent in total
The sensitive weakness of the two major coalition parties to date and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have led to the first preliminary results of the previous parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously missed, suffered strong losses.
On the contrary, the President of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the province leader of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a winning return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), remains with 29.8 percent of the votes, but has lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
Even worse was the OVP, which lost almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and the result is literally catastrophic especially for the People's Party, which has led to anticipated elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage over the SPÖ, according to public opinion studies.
But the voters were clearly punished for leaving the government to fail.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader Wilhelm Molterer and the current deputy chancellor.
The observers believe that this will take place on Monday at the party’s extraordinary meeting.
This development is likely to facilitate the renewal of the increasingly likely outcome from the election result, i.e. the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In the light of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties — the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) previously obtained 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes — the Social Democrats, however, expressed fear of the repeat of the year 1999, when the People's Party agreed in a joint governance with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, withdrawn from the BZÖ in 2005), which even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume he can return to Vienna for national policy, obviously awaits this solution.
The Party of the Greens came to parliament, which, however, slightly lost its popularity and fell from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the four-percent limit and did not enter the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may be frozen
If it failed to solve the problem of the Czech scientists charged with illegal bulgar collection, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg said that a certain cooling in the Czech-India relations could occur.
The minister said this after he met today in New York with his Indian partner, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which was held by Czech motivation.
After the trial, Mukherzi said that the executive authorities could be difficult to interfere in court matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed and sentenced to a fine, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeeling, whose legislation is the case.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherzi, Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
He would then be able to seek freedom against a guardian and to wait for the judgment, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
“I recommended an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to release him,” the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way in which the Czech party can interfere in the whole case is to provide the convicted "competent legal assistance", the Indian minister said.
However, he said that the Indian party had already provided them with such assistance.
“Our primary interest is to maintain the best relationships with India with a long-year tradition.
This is recognized by the Indians as well,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech Republic, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attributes great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
“We think it’s a serious mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
Asked whether the Indian party was given a promise to deal with the matter, the minister avoided the answer.
“I have already received relatively many promises,” he noted.
Czechoslovak judges fight for the sea
Go to the wall electronic map on which you can see Australia and neighboring sea areas.
However, it is not interested in the continent, but a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with it the neighboring sea.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, a member of the UN Ocean and Maritime Affairs Division.
His head, Václav Mikulka, a Czech lawyer, the director of the division, follows the explanation, which he sometimes adds.
Employment and enthusiasm dominate here.
The sea floor is a world rich in natural resources that is unknown so far.
There are oil, beans and other minerals, but there are also unknown living organisms, which can be the key to the development of a drug for cancer, for example.
More sea than land
The coastal states are now intensely seeking new underwater areas.
The United Nations Convention was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the so-called continental landscape area, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coasts of the country.
Such a country has a exclusive right, under the Convention, to all sources of continental livestock.
“Simplified, we keep the part of the sea floor and the lower layer of the continental landscape, which is a natural continuation of the underwater continent.
On the coastal sea borders, often two hundred sea miles exceed the border of the exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by a country to the Committee on the external borders of the continental landscape should be supplemented with extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of expensive research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"Our task is to provide legal and professional technical assistance to the Committee.
The committee has discussed five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
In the world, the recent success of Australia has caused a backdrop, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the sea floor assigned by the Commission is approximately 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times greater than the country's territory.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seafood are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries are also continuously submitting their applications.
They can do so within ten years from the moment of the ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental eruption ends, the ocean underground begins, declared by the Convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
No country has an exclusive situation.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seafood, however, is not Klondike," says exceeding director Mikulka by saying that "some of its territories are legally clearly surrounded and their regime is fixed in a contract ".
The Czechs in the Pacific
This area is currently part of the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern Block is shared with other countries within the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
According to the Convention in 1991, this organization, like investors in some other countries, received the so-called "pioneer investor" status.
It has the right to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area reviewed by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is sealed there, it is a copy of the Tatra of a kind of underwater.
"This can be extracted in a total of 75,000 square kilometers of area.
The area is a wealth of polymetal curtains containing nickel, reset, kobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian member of the division, is presenting another concrete example.
With a potato, or a little fantasy, it reminds me of a pergamen with magic words that bring me to life.
German Special Forces At The Rescue
The Egyptian government asked for help from Germany to solve the assault crisis - and experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
The release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is increasing.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, indirectly German special forces were involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the German Federal Army experts, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Airport and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the German Technical Service’s logistics experts were also on the site of the release.
The ministry's spokeswoman said on Monday night the German forces did not need it, however, as the kidnappers allowed their prisoners to run and then escaped when they recognized signs of violent kidnapping.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a local support force.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” the spokesman of the Federal Interior Ministry said.
A group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian companions were kidnapped in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in the desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were thrown to the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The circumstances of the hostages remained unclear so far as the details of the release of the hostages or the possible payments of the rescue.
The rescuers arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the kidnappers were under the protection of the German Embassy.
There were no details about the release.
In Berlin, there is no information about when they are returning to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the aircraft of the German Air Force Airbus.
The House of Representatives of the United States rejects the rescue package.
The House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress with a small majority defeated the $700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets.
Dow Jones is down.
The House of Representatives of the United States, with 227 votes against, rejected the government’s rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite the calls from the U.S. President George W. Bush and the leaders of the two parties, the program did not receive a majority, with which they wanted to remove the chaos in the financial markets.
The supporters desperately tried to convince the critics about the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic party’s negotiating leaders, called on the representatives to support them, even though the plan is still unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that has not yet happened,” he acknowledged.
Dow Jones fell by more than 6% and 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the vote ended, and then falls again after the failure was revealed.
Experts are expecting further severe turbulences on the international financial markets.
It requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The directors are registering more and more reservations.
Good winter is promised to German travel organizers.
According to one study, the traffic of travel reservations for the next months increased significantly compared to the previous year - more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic prospects, the travel preference of the Germans, according to the study, did not decline.
For winter reservations, travel agencies estimated a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
The traffic of travel agencies in October rounded 11 percent from October 2007, DRV.
These results are based on GfK’s data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account travel booked by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the U.S. was especially sought, DRV.
Here the rate of reservations increased by one-third round.
The destinations of the Germans are favourite in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic landscapes.
Most of the organized roads were sought,” said Klaus Laepple, the president of DRV.
Due to the rising energy and food costs, in the case of organized trips, the costs are “better calculated for passengers than for individually organized trips.”
Passengers can save money, including pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The number of bookings for the summer months was also very good, so there will be a further increase in traffic compared to the previous year – although another study found that fewer German tourists entered travel compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfest
Uninterrupted repeated ballermann slags, liters of crossing beers and design dirndlit wearing celebrity.
The debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I really don’t much like each other.
She is blond, a TV showman, and wears a customized dirndlit.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I took my clothes in the turquoise.
But one thing connects us: We’ve been on Wiesnen just three minutes ago, we’re already hit by photographers and filling their memory cards – it’s very flushing, and all this is my first visit to Wiesnen.
This is how we can get friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli meets its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the equator of the white cabbage, my sense of comfort is still limited by the people's presence.
But when it comes to Theresienwies, it’s no longer so terrible.
Almost everyone wears dirndlit or skin pants; no one looks shy or angry - everything is completely okay.
A strange look at the chocolate banana stand is just my dirndli bonds.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I’ve badly bound the bond: “You’re freely bound on the bal, you’re a virgin in the middle, you’re a virgin in the right, you’re a virgin in the back.”
I secretly wrapped the mask from the back to the left.
“It’s good,” he says and calls.
Others get fewer drive around the subtle flirting techniques, and they wear a simple flipboard with the inscription "I'm too drunk to dress up" and unwantedly show their naked back.
The exhibitionist character is called Bob, and he also visited the Oktoberfestre for the first time.
What you find is very fantastic, extending the "aaaaa" long.
All of this then tells me that he was getting rid of the content of his previously drunk crocodile.
Right next to one of the firefighters, which everyone sees as a rubber.
Bob is, therefore, one of the famous "free urineers."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight p.m. the rescue forces walk around the site and take care of the poor couples.
Patient careers always appear in a team - they put four shoes from the tent to the tent at the same time with a covered bar.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Arrival is empty, leaving is empty.
Who lies in the alcohol box under the pony is not visible.
“These are the ones who are completely ready,” one of the saniteets cried out to me on my question and then in the rotating.
Police identified the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The Brentwood resident, with the resident of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, the accident occurred on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road, the city.
He was transferred to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but he died later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of conduct.
Since then, he has been released against guard.
The expanding diplomatic horizon of Turkey
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers burned from the desire to deepen into the Turkish backland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, just 20 steps from the European border, there is one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial aspiration.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the style of the Neoresan.
At least the travel books write that.
The building surrounds the ends of the perons, with one to one tower on each front corner, and looks like some German rural city house.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly shrinking.
However, looking at the inside of the shopped ticket store, it is clear what large-scale enterprise that was the most western door.
The station was opened by the German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, “the late future” of conquests, intended to realize its ambitions to occupy the Middle East with the help of this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to today’s Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest attempts broke down during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Arab Lawrence and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station did not go better.
In 1917 a firearm train exploded and destroyed the well-designed top of the building.
Turkish sources said there was a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly broken down, and history has passed well.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region - at least in a symbolic sense - Turkey serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon.
The Government Party of Truth and Development (AKP) has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is a sign of commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with Hamas and Fatah’s Palestinian groups, with Iraq, Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I went to the Turkish capital, on a night train to Ankara to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish parliamentary representative, Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of darkness, which at that time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended to be a symbol of the new world state, which turns back to the Ottoman past.
However, the publicly known AKP with Islamic roots represents a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went by a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern, stone and steel building, specifically designed for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburban district, half-ready between shopping centers and coffee shops. The latter meet clothed middle leaders - both men and women - to make a business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have become a right-handed and middle-handed politician in any other European country.
He was dressed, dressed, and I’m sure he had even a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its direct environment.
The Cold War has destroyed the order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its backland.
We had to go to the east and the west at the same time.
He could not choose between the two.
He had to open in both directions.
“But is it possible that you will be forced to vote sooner or later?” I asked.
“Turkey has never wanted to face a response.”
He then emphasized what almost everyone with whom I talked here had mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea surrounding countries serve Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
As if they wanted to transmit the message that, in the transmitted sense, all Europe, along with Turkey, could reach Asia and the Middle East on the railways to the east.
When I was again at the Hydarpasha station, after another, mostly awake night, I thought of Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conura, the two German gentlemen who saw the restoration of this decorative building 100 years ago.
They would be surprised to find out that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I was waiting in the port for the compra to go back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that at that time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time there was no question which continent would be in need for this exciting country.
Memorial life routes: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as the Guildford Music Director, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Necrologist, September 11) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
Based on his musical plans for the city, he founded a wonderful youth chorus, Proteus, next year.
In principle, only people under the age of 21 could belong to the band, but when Proteus performed its final in 1979 – many of us were already on the end of our 20s – we were simply unwilling to get rid of the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changing name) was in line with the corus' determination and ability to cope with any cottage they are put to him - whether it is the madrigal or a piece of the Messiah; without accompaniment or with the accompaniment of the great artists.
The musical versatility of such a young chorus was often fascinating and always exciting, and we were thanks to the man whose inspiration our passion for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us, “Let the music speak by itself.”
He always said, “The musician knows what he wants.
Everything is in the box.
So sing it!”
His master's technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or excessive.
Whatever the music level, he has always raised it.
John Frayn Turner says:
If there was ever a bracelet that had to be hit as a rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I met him well in the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonicists from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past four decades, I have written criticisms about more than 100 concerts, but never, no one has caused disappointment, and often excited with them.
In Tod Handley there was greatness and humility together, which is very rare.
He hated the guides who, lived with his words, simply "galopped around the world with one or two well-known fighters."
Many of us will miss it.
by William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
According to your necrologist William Woodruff (September 25), "in 1946 he continued his studies of economics history in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholarship from the Houblon-Norman Research Institute ... while continuously prepared to obtain his undergraduate, master's and PhD degree."
This comes from the authors' lists of Woodruff's work "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economics history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, which he subsequently issued in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry".
In 1950-51, he actually stayed in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
You can’t know why Woodruff made his career beautiful this period.
J. Vicente Resino on the Artist
I recommend J. Vicente Resino’s exhibition “Flamenco and Life” because his photographs in black and white, documentary style are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that flow from them, as well as respect for the people on the photos, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is influenced by emotions.
Resino came to save the magical moments.”
Record of sales in Honduras
In November, Honda will start the sale of the second generation Jazz.
It is true that the passenger has already been quite large, but the interior design of the new model is even wider.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more convenient and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is how the second-generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although the new Jazz view is very similar to its predecessor, a number of internal changes have been made on it.
These include, for example, innovative design, new carrossery, greater sizes and new mechanics.
But before we move to the detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can argue that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less known in Europe, but it has recorded sales in other markets.
Jazz was the most popular car brand in Japan in 2002 and then in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces of the Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with almost half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
That is, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz in 2007, it is estimated to sell 100,000 cars by 2009, which would lead to a 17% growth in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 jackpots in Spain, accounting for 6.7% of its total sales in Spain.
For the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate 2000 copies sold over the course of a year.
Moreover, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate Honda’s turnover decline in Spain.
The company’s representatives are expected to sell 22,000 copies by the end of this year, which is 4,000 less than the 2007 data, a 16% decrease.
Despite the conditions of sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010 I would like to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda hopes that this will be achieved by introducing a new model.
It would be the Insight, a five-door and compact-size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces annually worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s market distribution will be spent by the United States, while the remaining will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial introduction of Insight after the official presentation in Valencia scheduled for January, will take place in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become wider in all aspects.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimeters wider) and the axis distance is increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height is unchanged by 1520 mm.
In addition to the size, the passenger space has become wider.
The greater interior space is guaranteed by the new carrossery on the one hand and the fuel container in the middle - this solution can be known from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the total rocket of the - so-called double floor - luggage holders has grown, currently 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters above the capacity of the first generation.
Although this means that the aforementioned sizes apply to the 1.4-motor type, since the 1.2 Honda Jazz baggage container is 379 liters.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as the back LED lights or the optional panoramic glass panel, as well as the easier access to the back seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the back seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second-generation jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its delivery, this small model can be ordered with two, 1.2 and 1.4 litre engines.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, both resources are better consumed than the previous model, with lower carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine provides excellent performance in all respects.
The 1.2 litre resource power is 90 hp at 6000 spins and its maximum impact is 114 Nm 4900 spins.
This engine - which was 78 hp in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and has 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine, which produced 83 hp in comparison to the previous generation, now reaches 100 hp.
The 100 hp 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
A “conflict car”
In order to develop accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by the nature, precisely the world of bees, for a new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot to avoid accidents by imitating the bees.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C will be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center, in collaboration with the renowned University of Tokyo Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Brand Director for Technology PR and Research and Development, defines that the BR23C is a further extension of Nissan’s four-level safety cover.
The robot improves the ability of the company’s products to avoid collisions.
During flight, each uterus forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety protector.
However, much more important is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it sees in more than 300 degrees in every direction.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers designed a so-called laser range finder (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies obstacles within a distance of up to 2 meters in a 180-degree view space before BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the microprocessor on board, which is immediately translated into an operation to avoid collision.
As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot, monitoring the movements of the uterus, immediately changes the direction by moving the wheels in a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
The system is most distinguished from the instruments currently available, so in this case the avoidance maneuver takes place completely automatically.
If not, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project.
Unlike the bees, the outgoing maneuver should not be directed up or down, and should not be transparent, only in two dimensions and exclusively in the direction of wheel reversibility, i.e. not in the infinite direction and in the way it is in the case of the bees.
That’s why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot, in addition to acceleration and slowing, to avoid collisions.
“This structure needs to process data every few seconds and respond to it.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuver, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
It may sound surprising, but it’s really not gigabyte, but we don’t even talk about megabyte memories.
This is the first step towards the development of an immediate collision prevention technology that, according to Nissan’s estimates, will be involved in series cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system can be an additional application option to bring the driver to the end destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of hypocrisy
We must acknowledge that the US Chancellor Department, in addition to having a lot of cash to be invested, has no lack of reason.
Because the crisis is on its neck and that the Americans do not go into the losers of doubtful payability hip-hop banks, they have created a fun and informative online game "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the “bad loan hotel” ... i.e. the Galibas.
The image of the accommodation and especially the reception hole suggests to think again, twice, and even more, three times, if it really is now the time to get a loan.
And especially where we need a loan, as it is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is useful, but little detailed.
It’s more for young people than for the public.
But what would happen if we complement the game?
For example, the room of our dreams will appear in the hotel.
And that’s because we don’t dream of buying a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced its share of its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). Japan's largest bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley's stock exchange has fallen sharply on the stock market.
A week after the announcement of the preliminary agreement, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's tribal shares for $25.25, or $3 billion in total.
The accepted price remains more than 19% from the value of securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which provide 10% profit, and their exchange rate is $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on a $29 average rate, which is 28% higher than the current rate.
Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley’s stock exchange rate fell by 6.79% around 17 p.m., according to greenwichi’s average time, closing at $23,07.
“This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transition into a bankholding company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley last week approved the new status, through which it can diversify its activities, while at the same time it is under the Federal Reserve control.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the companies listed on Wall Street.
On Monday, Morgan announced that it will sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the shares would be fully made up of tribal shares," said Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, due to the current market and economic situation, we would like to minimize and avoid possible risks.”
In terms of the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the revenue per share decreases by about 20%.
According to the agreement, MUFG may turn half of its priority shares into primary shares within a year if the trading rate of these shares over a given period exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50%, i.e. rises to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that with the funds from MUFG you can take advantage of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, the group's spokesman did not want to provide accurate information about the two new allies' strategic plans.
After the MUFG affiliation, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I payability rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said its balance has improved “resolently” since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a big effort for the group, with its stock exchange rate falling half, while the cost of its non-payment risk insurance has fled into heaven.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remains high, remaining around 12%.
One of the big investing banks remains "survivors" after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch's acquisition. This is Goldman Sachs, which last week announced that it reached $15 billion: part of it comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company group.
Rafael Correa's Monday statement, Quito
The rebuilding of the republic in the spirit of socialism of the 21st century.
This is a joint plan for Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Rafael Correa in Ecuador.
Following the pattern of his presidents and friends, Correa expressed on Sunday his views on the new constitution.
He successfully completed his mission as 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum, according to the official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted against, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were unfulfilled by voters.
The proposal was required by 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, both two surveys at the output of the voting agencies and a non-governmental organization’s accounting showed a huge exceeding of the “yes” votes with a rate of 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa spoke about the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday to Monday night.
"The Constitution has produced a tremendous victory," he said, and thanked the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, at its governor's headquarters.
As the well-known Rafael Correa congratulated Chavez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to the Observatory Mission of the Organization of the American States (OAS), the vote took place in a quiet atmosphere. its main topic was a 444 point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" protected by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power in the service of the economy, while the state retains the right to "planning development" for a country that essentially lives from oil production by foreign companies and the currency sent by immigrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also reinforces the power of the head of state, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and has the right to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it wants to take advantage of this opportunity and will again compete for the presidency in February 2009.
The Constitution also included the free of charge of health services and education. The President has already started its introduction in the country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants, and half of the population lives below the living minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country. This could end the Quito and Washington Agreement on the use of an Ecuador facility as the basis for U.S. drug measures.
19 prisoners were released.
Egyptian commander hit him on the kidnappers who ten days ago caught 11 tourists and their eight companions.
The prisoners are now in Cairo.
Eighteen European tourists and eight Egyptian companions were detained for ten days in the desert, from which they were transported to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The prisoners were released by an Egyptian commander in Chad in the morning.
The aircraft arrived at the al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to the international airport in Cairo, around 4:30 a.m.
The hostages were forbidden to declare to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maad, a suburban district in Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers "not paid a rescue" - said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were imprisoned on September 19 at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border areas of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where the Saharais were involved.The group was then driven by 35 unknown hostages from one hostage to another.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency of Aegyptous.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a special commander of 30 members arrived on two helicopters to the site, where they were hit by the hostages right before a row.
“There was a fire struggle between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest were escaped,” the leader said.
He also said that a total of 150 special troops were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were added to German and Italian commanders.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, emphasized the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We must acknowledge that this result would not have been achieved without the professional and effective interference of our intelligence personnel and our action groups,” he said.
He also denied that he had paid a rescue for the hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that they had arrested a land car on which the kidnappers travelled. Six of them were killed (including the Chadian leader), and two were arrested.
The army said the terrorists were in contact with a Dharuri rebellion, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the group immediately denied.
Lettres - The “Silent majority” of culture
The newspapers and the current election campaign are focused on the debate on the financing of culture.
We can only enjoy it.
But one piece of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will raise his word to reveal the ridiculous amounts of the small museums, archives, archaeological mines and national historical monuments on the edge of the hunger?
Which politician deserves to remind the federal government of not taking care of its monuments and buildings that are part of cultural heritage?
Or that neither in Quebec nor in Canada there are laws that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage must be co-protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Québec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies of history, cultural heritage, archive and genealogy work to explore history and to preserve a large number of private archives and archaeological findings with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with the dents and protests with the last strength of the fool, when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and our forgotten tombs.
When will anyone stand for the protection of the historical and cultural heritage?
The Government of Benelux Nationalizes a Part of Fortis Bank
With partial nationalization, the Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Netherlands bank, Fortison, to be the first European in trouble due to the reversal impact of the U.S. credit market crisis: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution, which has interests in Hungary, with a total of €11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed the issue at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission responsible for competition.
In the eurozone, the Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the world in the context of the international monetary market crisis that has surpassed over a year, and therefore, the decisions made in the bank’s case can be regarded as precedent in some ways.
The decision was made on Sunday night, according to which all three states will almost partly (49 percent) acquire the bank’s existing property.
The bank will sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amro, mainly as insurance companies.
Fortis’ shares began to decline sharply last week, with serious crises in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to allow bankruptcy.
The company’s securities dropped by about 12 percent on Friday to its 14 year-long bottom.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
With regard to current stock prices, the group’s total market capital is around 14 billion euros, but the company’s managers say this is unrealistic.
The company’s leadership, on the other hand, caused overseas market uncertainty about the approval of the US $700 billion package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the prices were slightly high.
On Friday, a new chief executive was appointed by Filip Dierckx.
The financial institution also sought private buyers, but no one has signed an important offer so far.
The Belgian government has already said that investors don’t have to worry, they don’t lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the accounts have not been shut down.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and has also purchased leasing companies.
Rock in the chicken
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of the prescription data in every case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in independent hands, otherwise we will trust the chicken to the rock," said Richard Dicket, the developer of the prescription program for the Washington Post.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance fee and the amount incurred in case of damage dependent on the health status of the reporting customer, and, if the risk is considered too high, they shall not make any insurance with him.
The person was sent to a medical examination and the contract was signed only with the knowledge of the results of the examination.
For ten years, Dick has invented a much cheaper procedure: from the pharmacies, the customer’s identification number makes it easy to obtain what medications the person has purchased in the past a year and a half, and from this program itself makes the conclusion of what disease he suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly take a large dose of cholesterol reducer, it indicates that your blood fat levels are practically uncontrollably high, which immediately ranges into a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some also set a risk frequency number, so the insurer has little to do outside the paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds can also be used against migraine or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the first is not.
For the request and processing of the data, separate companies have been formed, and they, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient’s consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Some companies are currently processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to the data on drug consumption so they can provide a even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and in parallel with this, the control of use will become increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but its scope applies only to healthcare providers and insurers.
The Congress has a draft law that gives authorities control over companies that specialize in data provision.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his program that would bind the data transfer to the express contribution of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot refuse the contribution, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with him.
Thus, the chickens are all referred to the goodness of the rabbit.
The Global Marseille Food
India and the European Union double trade
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trade partners, the agenda of the ninth summit was dominated by this topic, along with other, mostly global issues.
Today there will be a summit between France and India, where mainly nuclear cooperation will be discussed.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic great power, which should be more focused on international affairs, the Member States have not yet reached a common reference to whether to support New Delhi’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was not addressed by the Ninth Summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as EU chairman and Commission chairman José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double the trade in five years, which will increase trade to a hundred billion euros.
Since its trade has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
In this sense, the two-six bilateral agreements on civil aviation with India have been summarized in a legal sense, i.e. the air traffic may also be broken in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is to balance that while the EU is India’s number one trade partner, New Delhi is only ninth in the EU’s list of partners.
The summit focused on global matters.
The latter of the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and of terrorism, were condemned by both sides in all forms and called for a meeting of the United Nations.
It was also called for the end of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large part of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its insistence on its energy and climate program, which means it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India has also agreed that the next climate conference should be a global agreement and a reduction of greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent the rise in food prices and supported the convocation of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is on a visit to the French capital, where he is preparing for a negotiation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that French companies will receive an order of $20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement will last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian bookmakers in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
This year, the International Book Fair in Frankfurt will attend 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, in 171,790 square meters of basic area, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony at the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government is represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities: Italy will occupy a 264 square meters exhibition area through the establishment of a single Italy Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Structure" hall of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where it will also be an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects on the situation of the Italian book publishing.
According to the data, the percentage of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publishing.
Previous articleMillionaire Steve Fossett’s missing plane
The remains of Billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, which disappeared over the Nevada Desert on September 3, 2007, were found.
The ruins were found on a 3000-meter high basin, near Mammoth Lakes, located in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, the Madera county officer, dissolved all the still existing doubts: "We sent a crew after finding the flight's position, and now we can be sure it's the plane on which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said in a press conference.
The police also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Traffic Safety Office (NTSB) that a few hours after the detection of the crash, a investigation committee was asked to identify the plane and find that it was actually the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett departed from Nevada's Yerington on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal things near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two Fosset cards issued by the Federal Aviation Supervision in Illinois, some cash and a shirt.
His long search was resigned after a month of disappearance.
The billionaire has set a number of heights through which he has entered himself into history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he managed to first round the earth with an air balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, a plane drove the ground without landing.
Many of his records include the flight over the Andes, at a height of 15,445 meters, which he carried out with a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, at the same time original and fixed shape hobby car with large surfaces and cleaned corners.
In a few words, this is Mercedes-Benz’s latest “compact ground car,” which the German automotive factory has tried to bring a fresh momentum to the market.
This is why the introduction of the SUV GLK in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17 will be surprising and unusual because of the content that is different from the usual.
In fact, the advertising campaign accompanied by the introduction of the new vehicle is used by an unknown media communication tool, including through utopian 3D posters that the car brand has not yet used in Italy.
The giant plate action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan's central shopping street, Corso Comot, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the introduction of the car’s spatial effect, through which the new SUV, with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be visible in almost real sizes and in a three-dimensional form.
The person watching the picture will feel like the car stands out of the poster.
After that, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, all the details of the new GLK are made visible with each one and then made a single image.
It is undoubted that with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will this bring the interest of future customers?
Let’s show you who are the Italian football players.
Trivenet's young people. they are probably excluded from the tracks.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is now shameful? members of the group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the team for years, and which, in fact, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never fought with the opponent's fans.
The group is on the right side.
The organizers are from Trivento.
As well as from Verona, Padova, Tries and Udin.
These were joined by smaller sperm groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were thrown on which the town of birth of the fans was displayed: on Saturday they were removed so that they could not be identified.
Follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they were faced with a real Nazi fan battle, with the Levsky printers.
The Italian Football Federation has issued 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were tickets for names, making it easier to check the fans' team.
The Ministry of the Internal Affairs also checked out everyone: there was no one to be prosecuted against in Sofia, no one to be banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans who have a prius associated with football have been refused to get a ticket and leave.
Currently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is waiting for records from the Sofia police, and then takes the necessary measures: those fans who have been arrested or identified during the disturbances may also be subjected to a five-year ban.
It is an international prohibition that concerns visiting not only the Italian but all the stadiums in Europe.
Our football fans can’t put their feet on a single football field.
Fortunately .
But we must also be afraid that the Hulians will find followers, that is, that the only one hundred and fifty leaders will join others.
“These fires must be immediately shut down, and those who behave like this should not be shut down,” the Ministry of the Interior said.
So it is better to keep our eyes open, especially as the Wednesday match day is approaching in Lecce.
In Puglia there is a small cell that supports the Italian ultrasound.
The Observatory Service will meet tomorrow, and the Sports Events Safety Analysis Committee will meet on Tuesday, which may also rely on one of the internal security services departments, the secret services on the behavior of fans.
"Duce-Duce's scandal and the pushing arm under the Italian hymn is not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This idea was expressed, quite unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago as the head of the Observatory Service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente and previously by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police head of Tries, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to live the Ducet in Bulgaria, but even the 150-200 fans behaved as shameful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first person of the observatory service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the offence is committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any trouble. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to continue.
But let’s talk a little about the outbreak of the Italian hymn: it’s not a crime, but if I can say that, it’s not a good education.”
