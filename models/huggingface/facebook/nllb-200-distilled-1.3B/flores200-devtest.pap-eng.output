While an experimental vaccine appears to have reduced Ebola mortality, until now, it has not been clearly demonstrated that there are adequate treatments for the existing infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated that it had less of a benefit than its intended use in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a reference and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the charter of the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.

This not only confirmed that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already well known, but which could not generally be represented by fossil details, such as color and three-dimensional patterns.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish brown on the upper part with a light or grayish-brown underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers near the end of their life.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed tail called the rachis, but do have other feather characteristics  feathers and beard, the researcher concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight but rather for temperature regulation or for unfolding.The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed adult feathers and not feathers from a well.
The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample showed adult feathers and not feathers from a well.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a suspected Daesh militant (ISIL) of being responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: They discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was governed by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
It uses the brightness and rotation together to determine the number of stars according to Rossby's theory, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic reversal.

The work done was for the most part theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and our own galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, our galaxy also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in a similar way to how regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy, is surrounded by the galaxy in a sort of halo, and is made up of various small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: voters isolate themselves in a hockey hoop, putting a pre-printed piece of paper with their nomination of candidate of choice in an envelope.
After the employees verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in a box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law codifies the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot box has been transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are being sent in that are not those of the correctly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver from the racing Audi TT.
He was initially placed in the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Akedoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is locked up waiting for complaints and court cases, but any eyewitness evidence can be contaminated because her photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen publication of images as potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that it seems like journalists are going down a dangerous path if they publish photos etc. of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is fully in charge of prosecutions, has indicated to the journalist that it will not comment further, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the document, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to settle on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered included the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years when the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave this presence for only five years.
The guard of the cattle was to supervise the shooters in the additional case of harmful animal control in detail, as if monitoring the case in court and evaluating its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Shooting Sports Association's water program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the Deputy Director of Conservation and Heritage at the NWPS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the withdrawal of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, some of which were supposed to have taken place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of Ipod malfunctions were reported that overheated, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people injured.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the machines.
Last week METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company declared "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said there were no reported injuries in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children, adults and Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took the place of an adult who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began investigating premature births in her spare time.
Her research showed that giving a hormone would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the womb.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two black box flight recorders last week.
His fellow fighters also came to honor Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moon was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Moon died on the night of the second month. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
First Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign said that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those polled think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints her health was in doubt.
She was unable to take the necessary medications to treat her pain, as these are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25.
The discovery was verified by various people using different hardware and software in early February and announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets could have been a source of water supply to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed from cometary impacts long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as a political scandal and a political scandal.
There is speculation that he will seek the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims can allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to mark the position of an aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra running transport will be provided and no ground trains will stop at Wembley, and car and running parking facilities will not be available on site.
Fears of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to crossbreeding between an endemic Darwin grass, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus grass, Geospiza contrarios.
Gold can be formed in all kinds of ways. It can be made into very small shapes.
It can be cut into thin strips that can be bent and bent, or it can be beaten with a hammer or rolled into a fine cloth.
It can be made very fine, and then glued to other metal, so that it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-painted plates in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red colored juice.
The color of the taste changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
It indicates the pH level and the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried pieces together and then, with clean hands, wring them together to make a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outside air, which will feel strange and form a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet that could be drained in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a common room.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done is make our transportation easier and faster.
He gave us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and bison.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat small prey in much larger numbers such as insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has that sets it apart from other cats.
The lion is the most social of all felines, living in large groups called troops.
The bodies consist of one to three adult males, along with up to thirty female and young lions.
The women are usually close relatives, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion carcasses behave much like wolf carcasses or dog carcasses, animals that are remarkably similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in their behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
As a good athlete, tigers can climb (not very well, yes), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of humans.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can breed.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full voice of a lion, but more like a phrase of roaring and screaming words.
They eat insects, snakes, and even birds and other animals that live in the air.
Scientists believe that oselots follow and find prey through their noses, sniffing out where they have been buried.
They see clearly in the dark, and they also move very well. The birds hide in their nets, and in their nests they fly out of their nets.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) finds itself separated from the larger population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in a way that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different sources of support and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than they did before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to appear less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans inhale, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale, which they take out in their breath.
Plants make sun food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of wood and we make our clothes out of wood. Most of the food we eat is killed. Without killing, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the most ferocious animal of its time, meaning it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long tail is full of more than seventy serpent teeth, and seven horns come out of its mouth, indicating that it has no escape from anything that comes into contact with it.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a fork-shaped tongue, eaten turtles, large fish, several types of mosasaurs, and perhaps even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not contain it.
While most of their foods may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of exotic or unusual foods to savour, including wild boar, poultry, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
The rich men liked to sit on the couches while the poor women ate.
The ancient Roman diet could not contain edibles introduced into Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or coconuts, nor had any ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the house of a god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
The first section was set up as a courtyard, and the second section as a holy place, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to become part of the temples.
The tower was called the Holy of Holies.
In the hot Middle Eastern climate, the home was not so important.
Most Jewish family life took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the curries, the pots were just open pots overlooking the street, and the stones were used to build houses.
There were no large fields in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and on his journey westward, he came to Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each nation was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, this was not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears below the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (it measured 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was folded to preserve it.
So, they probably just put the note as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
The Vichy French were in power, and there were those who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to civis in Latin, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also in some other way defines the size of society.
City states are the ancestors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge through different generations, a persistent cultural identity, and a fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the sixteen states formed primarily a weak central government with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement all its laws.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The provisions of the Articles of Confederation required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended and the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives were regularly absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, it is often referred to as, at a geographical level, an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Formosa Island, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southeastern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native wheat production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Chamber.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most commonly used format for a still image in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the digital camera format sensor inherited its image ratio.
The 35mm format is actually, a bit confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the easiest ratio of an integer) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are the same or nearly the same as aspect ratio approximately.
The often abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guide to creating a dynamic while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location for the main object is a cross of lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under critical scrutiny.
For over a thousand years Christianity bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from kings to common citizens.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should be used specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been established in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and capital had many questioning whether it was in line with the basic principle.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval barricade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this barricade violated generally accepted international law and was codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even some neutral ships.
With limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitude of many citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations hoped to prevent such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a different dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of provincial division between each dynasty, the best known of these periods being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times there was a fierce battle between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history as thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, vacancies were open to all men who applied allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to soldiers because instead of ranking in the army based on class they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class or other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside of mundane life. He frequently visited a cave that became known as Hira on the hill of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the top of a hill north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find it even if you knew it existed. Once in the cave, it is a complete isolation.
For there is no heaven above, nor any mountain in the heavens above, nor any mountain in the earth beneath, nor anything that the earth can see or hear.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper arrowhead looks like a V and the lower arrowhead looks like a knot or a square without its bottom.
Above means you should start at the tip and grab the arm, and below means you should start at the handle (where your hand holds the arm) and pull the arm.
An upper ear generally creates a softer sound, while a lower ear is heavier and louder.
Feel free to write in your own notes, but remember that the printed sound marks are for musical purposes, so they should generally be respected.
In a panic, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two youngest children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of merchant women.
In a garrison, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and expressing threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their windows through the open garage.
At that moment a member of the crowd bowed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The costs of the war for American imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, to finance a large portion of the costs and interest of the bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking companies.
Of course, the profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would form the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is generally known as the High Medieval Period, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Early High Medieval Period was preceded by the Early High Medieval Period and followed by the latter part of the Medieval Period, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic underlying it associated with scientific law and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that has largely been influenced by cultural or political factors. and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, the car may necessarily lead to road development.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, meaning new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to more car accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new health care techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of determination, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the position of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that Crusader participants returned with gifts such as silk cloths and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style became very popular in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication of the channels, fashion in the West is going back 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style, one of the major developments of the time being the Crusades, when many people began to use buttons to tie clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses native plants that have been harvested from the ecosystem to combine with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically most farmers practiced self-sufficient agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the unfortunate few cases of children who, due to neglect, misbehavior, or intentional abuse, could not be socialized by adults when they were growing up.
Some of these children were confined to private homes (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to parental rejection due to a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Brave children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others were supposed to be raised by beasts; some said they lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animals that raised them, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather an aid that supports individuals who are going through a new experience of learning how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a docent is a type of support but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is too.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized into the software and aims to question, motivate, and explain procedures that may be present as a challenge for the student to perform on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that doesn't provide food, love, and education, but it does.
We find that the foster family system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster family system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The slave must help his family in every way possible.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of focus of use and gratification.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivational aspects for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal development and ongoing relationships are also new motivational aspects identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that can last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his document The President's Speech, points out how people who cannot understand bluntness due to brain damage can nevertheless understand sincerity adequately.
It even suggests that the same kinds of abilities as interpreting human behavior could be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resource would be the accessible proteins in beetles and rabbits, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (worms, yeast, worms) are not only easy to digest, but they provide high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet worker to bring you back to consciousness without waking you completely from sleep.
If you find yourself putting your coat back on in your dream, you may put the coat on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to pay.
Another biorhythm-based option is wrapping, drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, which are known to stimulate urination) before going to bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force is presented. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many Indian Yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing various gods, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment of consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war the conflict of systems, processes and cultures led to the end of cooperation between the countries.
Within two years of the war's end, the former Allies had become enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real battles, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and their only hope was to retreat and reorganize along with the Romanian fortifications.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the regions in eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is one of the most efficient ways to move large amounts of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and products, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and products.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that about 10,000 years ago goats began to be domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and fur.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that grazed around hills or grassy areas, often cared for by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, comparable to the more widely known shepherds.
Horse tramways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although horse-drawn trams were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to haul larger loads than on the slightly colder roads of the day.
Railings with cross-connections were introduced fairly quickly to hold the rails in place, however, it was gradually realized that the rails could be more efficient if they had an iron tip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rail was introduced.
The first known means of transport was by foot, humans began walking about two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (standing humans).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk straight.
In Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, bipedal specialization was found although, perhaps, Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases, except if we don't want only a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems, and we need to disable them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity's scientific and technological advances, and that the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of human beings.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten letter signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printer John Dunlap just a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, of what is now known as the Dunlap Broadsides.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon at the corner of Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who left it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many modern paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have scaly legs and claws, lay nets, and walk on their backs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one or two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and to use computer terminology these numbers are known as binary digits - or bits.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent; symptoms, such as coughing, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from the old notion of bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the killer insect and the bed bug stay far from their native habitat, adapted to life in the nest or house of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), positioning it as the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not only through experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
He accepted all of Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological processes.
For most living things, including bacteria, insects, plants, and animals, their periodic rhythms are documented, which are not simply reactions to periodically external signals.
Biological oscillators are self-sustaining oscillators that, even in the absence of external signals, will continue to operate for a period in the free-running cycle.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages (small viruses that infect bacteria), or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive fallout.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cell can be passed on to the child, while mutations elsewhere can cause death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include swimming, fishing, taking pictures, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in buses to go to work, while others whose work assignments are just outside the city pass by.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to, and supported by, a family car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented roughly.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between the three main characteristics are established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operations of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly enabled them to escape predators faster, forage for food, and reproduce more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings behind their bodies.
This gives them a wider range to hide in smaller areas from their natural enemies.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are mosquitoes and day-flying insects.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many thought the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because the world doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the longest river in the world, at about six miles long.
About 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population density.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language most state officials use daily, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be found in nature naturally and are relatively easy to obtain with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances into the forms we want to see.
An alloy is basically an alloy of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is a matter of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The portrait was a good friend of many when it was released.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods appeared, the portrait was degraded to a lesser status and use.
Now people text on their computer screens, never having to go to a sleeper.
One can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atom works on the principle that energy is needed to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like climbing a heavy mountain, and by re-switching the core, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break off from each other with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The waterfall is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the sea (darker-colored rocks on the moon) and thicker below the mountainous parts.
There may be more mary on the near side because the shell is thinner; it was easier for the wash to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature and become adults.
These theories look at what happens to certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their peers from the front. One end of the spectrum tries to remain one of them.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, executing disciplinary actions, performing performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for harm.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has been doing and do it their way.
After all, the leader is the one who is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in division between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are bound to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members since their team can agree on different time zones that their local management team may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can manifest.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as organizational knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum process as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, which therefore narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction implications, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and schematics, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions as well as recognizing handwritten letters, stamps and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Al system is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military service, and has also been used to build various home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take his students to places where a staircase or bus is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions where students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, remodeling the website each year, but keeping old versions online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with grammar and spelling as it is, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audiences, the blogger begins to make efforts to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging forces students to be more knowledgeable about the world around them. The need to nurture the audience's interest inspires students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also delineate their own perspectives on particular problems (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and features a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario stand out as, what people from outside consider, typically Canadian.
The larger areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a very surprising demographic comparison: There are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the other islands, and is a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it took great shape in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the European Cape Route to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sable Sea and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women who travel say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to wear a bra (but not too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they may consider to be a disadvantage and it is not uncommon for them to follow you, hug you, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter).
Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century CE, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meridians used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who established commercial bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the Old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajine, ceramics, leather goods, hookah and a whole range of geegaw, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist resort town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, just east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the state's streets, especially the state center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside Goma must be investigated to understand the fighting situation in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano with some of the cheapest routes to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda boda (brommer taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and foreign countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sanctuaries.
It was one of the main parades during Henry Louis Gates's special Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is in a striking contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important National Park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there is a daily conservation fee and an entrance fee to the park.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a graphic of bright bars that are made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour (Victoria Harbour).
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head in the opposite direction of the Kowloon coast.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place where the British colonists took possession, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the longest coastal mangrove swamp in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the jungle in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The seals, however, are not merely mudflats - they contain some of the last remaining supports of the powerful seals that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted tigers in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have a small Japanese Coaster Bus service, which is comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two lanes of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical passage under the bridge is 15 metres high. Completed in August 2011, the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be finalized.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group to live in what is today the eastern part of Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic nomadic peoples who also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived on logging, food gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the West Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain many aspects of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
You can also see smaller tournaments and parties at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which has a value equal to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British Points are generally accepted throughout the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On islands outside the centre credit cards are not likely to be accepted, however British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with the property owner in advance which form of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo lies south of the Equator, it is summer there while in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are normal.
Winters can be disappointingly cool: temperatures exceptionally drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly joyous or safe seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the animals are still wild and should not be fed or restrained.
According to park authorities' rules, stay at least 100 yards/meter away from wolves and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
Despite how tame they may seem, bison, elk, great whites, bears, and almost all large animals are vulnerable.
Each year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they fail to maintain proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that bees attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking foods with strong bees and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and England refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is divided into two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the area to the south.
Most of them are sacred beaches and swimming areas, and most of them have shady areas with palm trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on the Waitemata Harbour, which is in the luxurious suburb area of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a wide variety of pack animals on the beach.
The main local dish is Number One, not a complex dish, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are many French wines, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia will be better on the tour.
Tap water is great to drink, but bottled water is easy to get if you're scared.
For Australians, the concept of flat white milk coffee is foreign; a black coffee is an espresso, cappuccino comes with a cream filling top (not foam), and is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many surfing expeditions take place year-round, and injuries caused by any of these on the reef are rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Water sponges are present near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally they may be present outside these seasons.
There are some who are, but they rarely attack people. Most of the fishermen are afraid of people and swim away.
Freshwater crocodiles do not normally live in the ocean, their primary habitat being the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking removes the traveler's worry about whether they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have specific hotel arrangements, however you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping places, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or if you need to take care of other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agency first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors to music festivals decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Note that although the music on the main stages may have been finished, other sections of the festival will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the direction of the cabin, as ice exposure causes horrible bruising for the most traumatized.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money their guests spend. They usually have no windows and no clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them occupied.
Some sites offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness obscures good judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of being careful.
Anyone who is going to drive a vehicle at high altitude or on mountain trails should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On a road with ice and snow, friction is low and you cannot run as if you were running on empty asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow may fall to get you stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or flying snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic almost always continues to move year-round without interruption.
Safaris are probably the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari in popular usage refers to a land trip to see the amazing African nature, particularly on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars and standard equipment gives good visibility.
Lions, leopards, and panthers are sometimes shy and you'll see them better than foxes.
A safari walk (also called a bush walk, hinking safari, or footing) that consists of walking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation procedures vary, but as of March most coronavirus-based cancellation procedures do not extend to July 2020, the date the Olympics were rescheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Wetting wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have a wring iron and wring table available to wring, even if there is no present in the room.
If the hair dryer is not available, or you do not want to brush your teeth, you can use a hairdryer if available.
See to it that the cloth is not too hot (for it may cause it to crack, or in the worst case, it may be burned).
There are several methods of water purification, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, one minute of water is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying water in a bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Tax-free purchases are an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont contains the most challenging conditions to run on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh railroad, frequently passing through isolated and remote hilly terrain.
If you're not used to running on country roads, keep your cool: perpendicular climbs, narrow paths, and dominant serpentine valleys.
Boats with speed limits are obviously lower than in the previous and following sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict compliance with them is even more important than in other cases.
Remarkably, however, cell phone service is stronger here than at many other parts of the route, e.g. at Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good, and in Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apple baked in the pastry shop all year round, and cherries and prunes making their appearance during the summer.
Many German cakes also contain almonds, honeydew, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of steamed coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or hot depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions or northern parts of India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used in curry; in South India and some other coastal regions of the sub-continent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term covering a very wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
However, when used without further specification, the term tends to mean the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Today widely available around the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of simply seasoned dishes, the dominant flavor being Javanese favorites of pepper, pepper, succubi (especially Javanese coconut juice) and various aromatic spices.
The strap is supported by the foot of the rider that hangs on each side of the strap.
They provide greater stability for the runner but may have some safety aspects due to the possibility of a runner's foot being caught in them.
If a runner is pulled from a horse and his leg is caught in the strap, he may be exhausted if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions may be taken.
The first thing a runner needs to do is to put on a harness and shoes that are soft and tight.
Next, some seats, particularly English seats, have safety bars that allow the leather strap to fall off the seat if pulled back by a removable handlebar.
Cochamó Valley  Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and large cliffs.
The mountain peaks include impressive views from the highest points. Climbing practitioners from all over the world are constantly creating new routes between the infinite potential of the walls.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport involving a slide down a snow-covered terrain on a ski or a snowboard attached to your foot.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bombers", planning events entirely around skiing at a particular site.
The idea of skating is very old - cave paintings show skating dating back to 5000 BC!
downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club.
Ski touring: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to but not usually encompasses the styles of alpine skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering, the latter being done on perpendicular terrain and requiring more rigid skis and shoes.
Think of the ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good condition you can cover slightly longer distances than walking but you will rarely find cross country skiing speeds without a heavy slide on prepared routes.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for visas and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas from other Schengen member countries apart, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antique goods; some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Seed products can be defined as antiquated, even though they are younger than similar products that have been mass-produced.
The production of wine is an important part of the life of the farmer and the culture related to the business is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, though, not all breeders have been involved in large-scale whale breeding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and similarly, whale breeding more as pack animals.

If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the councils of other governments that are not yours, but their councils are designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often purely work-oriented, general and vastly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the common term for any weather hazardous phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The signs of the times are strong winds, hail, thunderstorms, and wildfires, as well as bad weather, loud noises, rumblings, heavy rain, and hurricanes.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include heavy snow and high winds, blizzards, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather affecting their area as this can affect plans immediately.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone will need to receive professional training.
An internet search for Hostile environment course will likely give you an address for a local company.
A course will usually cover all of these discussed problems at a much more detailed level, usually with practical experience.
A course will typically be 2-5 days long and will include wrapped role-playing games, many first aid sessions and sometimes weapons training.
Books and journals dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Passengers planning a sex change operation abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents also varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints became much more intensive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people should not expect to pass the scanner with their privacy and dignity intact.
A rip current is the flow of water back from waves that break on a beach, often into a reef or similar body of water.
Due to the underwater topology the return flow is concentrated in a couple of deeper sections, and a strong current to the deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of consciously trying to swim backwards against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to focus on a direction where you don't go back into the flow or, depending on your skills and if they notice you, you may want to wait for rescue.
Recurrence shock affects you faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is less frequent), it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who have adjusted to a new culture often have difficulty adjusting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you adapt to a new culture and lose some of your habits from your own culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably sympathetic and sympathetic to you, knowing that a traveler in a new country has to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show on the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Often you hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx serves as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
It shows the scenes on the pyramids and the light shines on the different pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the majority of the base, with sixteen of them active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the colony of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the peninsula, bounded by Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula join the terrain, then come together again to form the 360-kilometer chain of Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with the summit of Mount Vinson at 4,892 metres.
In remote locations without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a cell phone, because you need to be out of direct view of the satellite to make a phone call.
Navigation uses this service frequently, including recreational boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year-round is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with high school graduates, giving them a year off before college, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a one-year internship abroad can really increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return home.
Typically, there will be a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for surfing. The land of a thousand lakes consists of thousands of islands, lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a boat in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough to offer a different experience for any yacht, smaller boat or even a kayak.
Swimming is a national pastime of Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This figure is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but on its own somewhat unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figures are one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruisers have an extended stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days while returning at night and sleeping on the boat.
If you only disembark using the boat itself, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
There are cruise ships that mention Berlin, Germany in the flyers. As you can see on this map above, Berlin is not by any means close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fear and personal aversion that many others have.
For some, a little understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome fears based on the unknown or out of control.
Good courier companies are paid for quick delivery. Often, time is more important than business documents, merchandise, or parts waiting for urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies had their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If the cargo was sent by air, some routes could take days to clear through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it through faster is to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without passengers, so here's where your part begins.
The alternative to flying first class or business class is to pay big money for the privilege (or, better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come cheap: as a rule you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy amount for business and eleven times for first class!
It generally makes no sense to seek a reduction in business- or first-class seats on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines know that there are a group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, so they charge heavily.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Roman, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
Formerly the old town of Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed and occupied commercial center, built around a huge valley and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern commercial centres feature traditional thatched roof benches, 18th-century markets, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.

Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, and also a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
Many of the men and women who survived that time were still alive, and many more had their loved ones killed or enslaved to death there, both Jews and Greeks.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site with markings or scratch graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of them prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the languages are only indicated in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.

Regular announcements are made in Metro only in Catalan, but unplanned interference is announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, insolent and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is still to behave excellently, behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well raised). This will make your stay considerably easier.
The abrupt appearance of the Parisian will evaporate quickly if you demonstrate some basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested with beech and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its microclimate scale, different soil types and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Few common species such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, wolf, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie (auerhoen) can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women should wear skirts that cover their wrists and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer a cloth to cover women who do not come dressed, but if you bring one of your own, especially one of bright colors, you will find a smile to the nun or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men should cover their heads.
You can also wash your clothes at the entrance, but do not wash them after each washing, or you may not feel comfortable wearing these shoes. For a man, one shoe is all right.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean area, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular meal, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any other available food such as cheese, fried fish, etc.
All nouns, including the word for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It certainly makes reading easier, although writing is less complicated because of the need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also, try to pronounce r and rr differently: dear means dear, while car means sweet.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So reading this grammar introduction will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you can speak a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may conclude that Portuguese sounds so good that they don't need to study it separately.
Near modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in the days when they were important was not the type of problem it is today, they are often located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes have enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where spring flowers were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor alone and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Trees look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
If you visit a formal garden, if you collect specimens, you are also taken out, without any argument.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But since it is located in the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator you need to deal with both heat (always) and sunshine (when the sky is clear, less common).
There are also buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their families.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes into Hebron and not just the Jewish settlement near there, called Kiryat Arba.
Small lakes can be a good theme to build a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to interesting towns along the Danube or sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes that are popular for walking or cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays for Christians, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.

It is traditional to spend Easter night up in an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There is of course a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it may well be a ritual of spring and fertility near Christians.
Most traditional churches often hold an Easter Sunday Mass on the Saturday before Easter weekend, where congregations often begin a midnight celebration to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, jumping, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland mammals could not make the journey and so the giant tortoise became the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cattle, jackals, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark for about 24 hours a day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is usually not a problem, you can enjoy the stars as well.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
They wear flowers as standard professional attire, and colleagues call each other by their name or job title.
Harmony at work is crucial, emphasizing group effort over praising individual achievement.
