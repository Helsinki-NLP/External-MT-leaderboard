Below are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
There are many small cats (especially free-ranging domestic cats) that hunt for numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the concept of a niche a special position that each cat occupies and that keeps it from competing with others.
Leos are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called pride.
The prawn includes one to three adult male relatives, as well as up to 30 females and cubs.

The sharks are very quiet, and their night vision enables them to see in the dark, so they hunt their prey by hiding in the environment and then suddenly leaping out to catch it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to another island and thus cannot easily return), they can often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
In this new environment, different resources and different rivals, so the new species will need to either develop new traits or become a stronger rival than it was before.
Indigenous peoples have not changed at all they still need the same adaptation as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.

Plants produce oxygen, which is breathed in by humans, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which is expelled by humans.

Mosasaurus was a high-order predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth on the front of his thighs, meaning that no one who got in his way would be able to escape.
We don't know for sure, but maybe he had a tongue split, and his diet was turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe he was even a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like Thyrex couldn't compete with him.

35 mm, which was the main format at the end of the analogue era.
today, it's still in production, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has adopted the formats of digital camera image sensors.
35mm is actually a bit of a bump in the pan, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APIs family of formats) are equal to or very close to this ratio.

At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity held the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresence affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should fight against suffering and poverty, and the church's money is for that.
The central body of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question whether the church really held that position.

The same is true for the military, because instead of rank based on class, they're now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many representatives of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.

The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
actually, it's not that easy to find, even if you know it exists. once you get to the cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramids built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Necropolis of Giza", is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Pyramid of Cheops), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives and family members of Cheops.
The "up" tag looks like the letter "V", and the "down" tag looks like a bracket or square without the bottom side.
Up means you start with the head and push the knob, and down means you start with the pads (where your hand holds the knob) and pull the knob.
The upward movement of the hammer usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the hammer is stronger and more forceful.
Please feel free to add your own labels, but note that printed labels for the stapler have a certain meaning, so they usually need to be taken into consideration.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of women from the marketplace drove the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles and forced them to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen.
urba made the king and queen keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the gang waved to the queen, who was terrified by the head of a Royal Guard soldier who had been killed in Versailles.
The military expenses of US imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay a significant portion of the expenses and interest on loans placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, be the main achievement of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that inspired the creation of the Order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Classical Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, the end of which is generally considered to be around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or the technological imperative to the idea that human destiny is strictly dictated by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development as such follows a path that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that are more inevitable than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might argue that the machine necessarily leads to the construction of roads.
The national road network is, however, economically unviable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare methods for treating bodily injury.
Romantism carried within it a significant element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with this geography emerged, and they, being in harmony with society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is famous for being the epicenter of luxury, dating back to about 400 C.E., and lasting until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its situation deteriorated mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than in the Byzantine markets.

Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.


In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the time was the use of knots to attach clothes as a result of the Crusades.
farming which aims to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic system that uses harvested seeds of native plants of a given ecoregion in combination with seed exchange and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farms have been organic farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel they are being ignored by societal standards and allows them to acquire a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by age, ethnicity, social class, place of residence and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as a distinct phenomenon may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their belonging through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion items, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few stories of poor children who grew up in neglect, misery or deliberate cruelty, and were not socialized as adults.

It could be that the wild children were abused or seriously injured before they were abandoned or they ran away.
Some were said to have been raised by animals; others were said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
A non-civilized child raised by animals behaves in much the same way (within physical limits) as the corresponding pets, for example, treating humans with fear or indifference.
And while design technology is supposed to make learning easier and more fun, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help given to individuals who are learning a new material, such as a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is acting as a relay, like a little human-violin in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds in software are designed to ask, point out and explain procedures that can be difficult for students to learn on their own.

No child should be raised in an environment that is devoid of care, attention and upbringing, but they do grow.
We feel that the foster care system should be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system provides for safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.

Internet is a combination of mass media and interpersonal media.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and enjoyment.
"Learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Egmy and McCord (1998), when they investigated audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions facial movements lasting for several milliseconds.

Oliver Sachs, in his article "The President's Speech", pointed out that people who are unable to understand language because of brain damage can nevertheless accurately determine sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be possessed by animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two types of genotypic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations
Segregation and recombination change the variation between the two reservoirs with each generation.
The human digestive system makes it difficult for primates to meet their amino acid needs from the plant resources available in the savanna.
Plus, if you don't do this, you're going to have serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and beans, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless we cook them.
The food from animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only well digested but also provides a significant amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
though, given all these things, it shouldn't be surprising that our own ancestors were dealing with the protein question in much the same way as chimps are dealing with the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
You can do this easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking up completely.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking large amounts of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, causing you to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is the exact opposite of the level of tension in his body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.

Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been supplemented by the love of Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple.It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
KundaliniYogaKundalini (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central theme of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. As the war ended, conflicts of systems, processes and cultures led to these countries being re-fought.

It would last for the next 40 years, and there would be real battles between armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.


The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time creating obstacles to your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
one of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II where the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines primarily, tried to stop this movement.

Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy production of milk, wool, meat and leather.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hillsides and other pastures, and were tended by goats, often children or teenagers, better known as shepherds.
The Gauge Road was built in England in the 16th century.
And although the goose roads were basically two wooden planks placed parallel to each other, they allowed the horses that worked on them to develop higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more bumpy conventional roads of the time.

This became common practice, although iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron, and the first fully iron racks were introduced in 1767.
The first known movement was walking, people started walking straight two million years ago, with Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright, as is customary.
Bipedalism is found in the fossil remains of Australopithecus dated to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelianthropods may have begun walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more eco-friendly lifestyle, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to at least somehow reduce future suffering.
In many cases, it's just a symptom treatment. However, if we're not looking for a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.

After being passed by Congress on July 4, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, the manuscript was sent to John Dunlap's printing press, located a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150-200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Brodside.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall, on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy arrived in London on August 10.

n't a lot of people think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
Though birds still have a lot to learn from dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus.
actually, all the computers we use today are run by processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
In binary number systems, there can only be one or two values, such as 0 or 1, and in computer jargon, these numbers are called binary numbers or bits.
Poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The first sign of poisoning may be the presence of an open vial of a medicinal product or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label for specific first aid recommendations for this particular poison.
From a formal point of view, entomologists describe this group of insects as beetles.
The term reflects a centuries-old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both cones and bed bugs are nesting insects adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
United States has about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among middle-aged and younger people.
A disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or that it is not in the best interests of their child.
Such parents may decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents are stripped of parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to learn how the world works, and this method actually drives most of the research.
Although not just experimentation, an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses; questioning and observation also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focusing on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms we observe in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their functioning through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic factors, are recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the cycle period, running freely even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the major hypotheses in the question of whether DNA is genetic material.
Hersh and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus, or labeling the proteins of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material, and whether or not the cells are attached to the germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells are passed on to the children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and exploring ecosystem information.
Another example is visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo, and also getting new information about them.

In this dynamic transport movement, back and forth, everyone is somehow connected and maintains a transport system that is based on private cars.
sciences now point out that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone lives in a community and uses transportation systems, and not everyone complains about them.
You don't hear these kinds of complaints in the developed world about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and failures every day? Is it that transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Is it something more fundamental?
is the definition of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interaction.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because you cannot predict a driver's behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a fairly consistent manner; thus, traffic flows are mostly somehow logical, and can have an approximate mathematical model.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and maintenance of roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This opens up a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings are the butterflies and the one-night stands.

The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.

The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the structures of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
Vatican uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.

Vatican City is a Catholic city.

The philosopher Aristotle proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also hypothesized that they evolved into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mostly mixtures of two or more metals.Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
You can also get alloys that will include non-metallic elements, such as carbon in small amounts.

The basic principle of an atomic bomb is that it takes energy to bring together a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy weight upwards, and the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break down with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The upper layer of the moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the high mountains.
On the near side, there might be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner, and the lava would be easier to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people tick or what makes them like.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been adopted by them in the process of adulthood.
These theories cover certain people and what makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment make them do certain things or don't.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory. The two most popular theories are:

This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, allocating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable personality who feels like you have to change everything that the team has done and do it your own way.
Ultimately, the leader is solely responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are some differences.
The virtual team members often act as a point of contact with their immediate real group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet within time zones, which may be confusing to their local managers.
The existence of a true "invisible collective" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual collective.
"Invisible Team" is a management group to which all members report. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the process of implementing a learning organization that takes so much time? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts in practice might be innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result of the process of working together, an organisation can overcome barriers and create a new innovation process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can innovate, management must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, and thus narrows down the search field and makes it more precise.
scientists in their studies support the relationship between pathology in the brain and behavior.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumor affect behaviour and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that no one has ever seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important subdivision of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
In AI research, machines are forced to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and design, the ability to respond to customer assessments and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
This kind of thing has become a separate discipline, focused on solving real-life problems.
AI is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into several applications related to home computers and video games.
Tours are an important part of any classroom. Often the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual classroom, where students can look at museum artifacts or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Virtual tour is also a great way to think about travel and share experiences with future classes.
