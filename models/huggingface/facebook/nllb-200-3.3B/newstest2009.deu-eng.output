The Prague stock market is down to close.
After the steep morning fall, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions in ČEZ's shares amounted to almost half of the normal daily trading.
The Prague stock exchange, which had fallen another six percentage points, continued its downward trend from Monday, as it began trading on Tuesday.
This time, the reason for the break-in was Wall Street.
The Czech Republic also reflects the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives rejecting a plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
The fall in Asian stocks
Shares in Asian markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indices were able to recover some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Exchange in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points during the day's trading but recovered some of the losses later, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell 3.6 percent after the local index.
"The timing of the bailout in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide", said Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its own monetary policy independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that American lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the financial support bill.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected by the breach.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The US House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would have cost up to $700 billion.
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
In his view, the Bush plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the overall economy.
American stocks were plunged into a bloodbath on Monday, with the major stock indices recording their biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, the last time it had seen a similar drop was in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little indication that the bill would not pass the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress concedes: US government is allowed to pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote on this is due to take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to pass a $700 billion bailout of the American financial system.
But that doesn't mean we've won.
Congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the bill.
The plan to support the financial system will be debated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, told Reuters.
The Senate, according to various reports, could probably vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.
Economists believe that announcing the plan would be the first major psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
But then there is a "sober" because of the complicated mechanisms of how to help the markets in practice.
The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differences on what a package to stabilize the market should look like", Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future.
Representatives of the legislature met with the American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the financial sector is able to meet the needs of the Community.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
The recovery plan has to be continued, but I think we are there", says Paulson.
A Signal to Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis is also having a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, lawmakers are trying to get a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
The move was intended to reassure investors against trading in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a decision by Congress could affect trading on Monday.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the European Parliament is able to take part in the European Parliament's deliberations on the future of the European Union.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo some changes.
The total amount of aid to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be provided as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining money if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
The President has a veto on that decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained the same, which was based on obtaining funds to buy back bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay back their mortgages.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress made in this area has also satisfied the American President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and "appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said that lawmakers had agreed on accountability for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the completion of benefits and a timetable for funding the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The Ministry of Finance should be in charge of this.
"We have worked very hard and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans", said Paulson.
The plan also provides for assistance for homeowners who have problems paying off their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates for mortgages it buys, with the goal of lowering the monthly costs for borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help is needed
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses between each other", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek's view.
"More importantly, congressmen must agree to support the plan and pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that adoption is coming is the most important thing at this moment,' emphasised Marek.
Duel on the knife edge: MP3 players against cell phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost any cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
So it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons why you should get a player of your own.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It's hard to buy a really good expensive turntable to play the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
For one thing, such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
But if you have art rock, jazz, or blues LPs on your shelves, you probably dream of at least one.
So it's the same with music on the road, with compressed music, in simple terms, MP3 music.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
It may not be acceptable for one person to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably have difficulty withholding headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, with enough room for everyone in between.
The choice is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players do more than play music, but what cell phones can do, they can't even hint at.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to its primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a camera that's better and a camera that's worse, and maybe even navigate.
And if you add the smartphones and the communicators, you're almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also has its drawbacks.
But the more features you use on your phone, the more you'll need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy drainers.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, and most of them are much less.
Music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful in this respect.
So, with cheap cell phones, you should expect that they won't play music for more than a few hours.
If you do use your phone occasionally, you may want to buy a charger for the office - even if it is more expensive.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the less-than-good ones can last at least nine hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem is when you want to play the music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small number of devices have a USB port, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With Players, you don't need any special software, except for the iPod.
All you need to do is to feed the device music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create their own music library, sorted by artist name, album title, genre, or user rating, for example.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address book, similar to Windows Explorer, some can both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a particular device, you should ask about the battery life, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound, and of course the ease of use.
If you listen to music in the background, for example, for a short time each day in the tramway, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files will suffice.
Which is what almost every cell phone can do.
You also do not have to control what music formats a mobile phone or a player can handle.
MP3's all created, and most of the music you're going to get is going to be in that format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow people to buy music online.
All you have to do is go to the corresponding websites of a provider (or of another provider) via the mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service may be a powerful argument in itself for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the service providers' offer is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it is expected that this particular form of music sales (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you are always carrying headphones or at least a wireless speaker.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every cell phone has, but very few MP3 players.
The biggest advantage of music phones will be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three or four thousand crowns you can get a decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most of them will be that they don't have normal headphones.
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3.5 mm aperture for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is, in turn, the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really be used by anyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of a misplaced mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous bill for data transmissions.
What Tools Should You Use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a card, two thousand crowns will be enough.
But beware.
The basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will then have to put no more than 1100 krona on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you should take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3s, and the ease of operation is comparable to that of a single MP3 player.
The most advanced is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series of phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) are provided by MP3 players from the manufacturers mentioned above.
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe you do .
The Czech mobile market is quite mature, with Czech operators offering virtually all services as offered by their Western European counterparts.
However, there is something missing here - a virtual supplier that forces the classic ones to lower prices.
Perhaps this one will not be long in coming.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
The latest steps by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really does make a fight fan.
It may sound paradoxical, but there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and penetration is well over 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, are happy to complain that there is extreme competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, often agrees with this.
It is likely that a traditional operator with its own network would not have much chance (and would also probably not be able to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual vendor.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market in particular led to a significant price reduction, to which the traditional operators also had to react.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the amendments proposed by the rapporteur.
But it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February this year, we reported on the launch of the mobile virtual service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the company has managed to attract more than 100 000 customers and become the fifth largest provider in the country.
The financial group behind Mobilking is Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that they can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, virtual providers need much fewer customers than a traditional provider.
The Commission has therefore decided to open the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1191/1999.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, in the UK, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a very good move to target a non-stereotypical audience.
This is because this particular provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust", said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of the virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could also take root in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone's spokesman Miroslav Čepický also expressed doubts: 'The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services".
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators say they have no chance
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator takes over the Czech Republic, it will not be the mobile king.
"While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not looking particularly promising.
It will be more likely that Mobilking will enter the market in other countries in our region", said Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
The interest of the GTS Novera Group in the launch of a virtual mobile operator has been evident for some time, as it wants to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer segment.
'We have a strong interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them", said Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe there'll be better times to come.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far, it is surrounded by an impassable wall of silence.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech Republic for a full-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market has a high degree of specificity compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area", says Vlastimilše Srň from Telefónica O2's press department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The specific character of the Czech market is also highlighted by other suppliers.
In a rare agreement with O2's statement, T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds: "So far we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build".
And she adds, "T-Mobile's network will barely have a virtual provider by the end of the year.
We would have to have a concrete offer at this moment to be able to think so short-term".
Vodafone is more concerned with meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický comments: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the best thing from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile Internet".
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the suppliers
The approach of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another operator would mean more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus to a decline in profits.
So why should one facilitate the entry of such a competitor?
The fact that suppliers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth around the emergence of U:fon.
The biggest pressure on ČTÚ was probably from T-Mobile, when U:fon was launched.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ website.
But U:fon is a good argument for not allowing a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: 'The competitive environment of the mobile communications market has also been recently strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, in particular, on its services.'
However, in view of this approach of the mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulators is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately - unlike the United Kingdom and other advanced countries - does not have the competence to interfere in economic competition.
The only owner of this office is the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical attitude to the whole problem.
'The entry of a virtual mobile operator into the market would be possible only after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional suppliers", said Kristián Chalupa, from the external relations department of the ÚOHS, in response to our inquiry.
The Commission has not yet been able to conclude that the aid is compatible with the common market.
This is more than a matter of concern for an authority which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, Kristián Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers operate normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price decrease in mobile telephone services".
However, it is unlikely that the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are in the interests of the ÚOHS.
The most striking thing about this case is the almost touching agreement between the three mobile operators, which is the result of their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
The same is true of the price of petrol at petrol stations, which is certainly the result of a hard competition.
'The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in this matter in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant position on the market and therefore has no corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market to virtual providers are also likely to be lacking in the telecommunications regulator", Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial issues.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, carried out by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators holds a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, take a different view - the entry of a virtual provider always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile phone operator has, logically, a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment.
Even if one does not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera mentioned above) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all the suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is a commonly used trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the extension of the competence of the ČTÚ to the area of economic competition in telecommunications was not implemented in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, although a number of experts had promised that this would improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
I'm fine if no one is looking
The functioning of some pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, is not noticed.
They are companies which issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
These are usually companies that are involved in multilevel marketing.
The main sources of funding are the private sector, the public sector and the private sector.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only selected customers.
The irony is that the company is a classic corporate customer vis-à-vis the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a key customer, he receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit reselling of a similar nature.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will deal with, which may lead to the termination of cooperation with the relevant company", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem.
However, it is unlikely that this is not a matter of discussion among the operators of mobile telephony.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
The fact that the activities of these companies do not generate a negligible profit for them does not mean that they are not affected by the actual official marketing, unlike the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický points out the problems: "The law allows for these types of speculation, but the services of these companies are used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have full control over it like normal customers of the mobile operators.'
But even that would make the CTU look strange.
In addition, there is another question for the ÚOHS.
The mobile operators are turning a blind eye to this, so why are they turning a blind eye to a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has a very strong competence to detect such activities and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers that they did not know about it and that their business conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As already emphasized in the text several times, the entry of virtual providers into the market has led to a significant fall in the price of the various services.
In practice, however, in all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small or too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, it was precisely at this point that regulatory bodies intervened, not in the interests of the mobile operators but in the interests of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator, and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole thing at them like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot help feeling that in these cases the lack of clarity of the skills is more than beneficial.
But let's not throw the gun into the fire.
If the background information is correct and a virtual operator appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be back on the move.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will no longer have to pay more for their telephones than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On the occasion of the Czech Republic's Statehood Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem, Where is my homeland, in a ceremony on Sunday.
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The song was written by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
The iHNed.cz server allows you to listen to all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier, he had told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices, who are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both of them and then with the choir, so that the text could be understood well, so that harmony could be created", says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will be celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first heard in 1834 on the stage of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously adopted it.
The first stanza of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
What's the "new" anthem?
The Prague transport companies will also be using a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will go down in the history of Prague's public transport as the date on which the first passengers boarded a metro, tram or bus carrying an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper one.
The Commission has already published a report on the implementation of the directive on the protection of consumers.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it added to their chip card at the same time, at the information centres and transport companies' branches at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Kobská Raj zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the Internet at the transport companies' website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon.
Those who use the Internet can really forget about the ticket window at the subway stations, where they regularly had to wait in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon online, and it is added to the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, travellers can also use a desk with trained staff who can advise on buying online and also put the coupon on the card", says Martin Opatrný, the project's spokesman.
In addition to libraries, the electronic coupons can also be placed on the opencard at self-service vending machines installed in some subway lobbies.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket values, and passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there will be eighty", Opatrný adds.
The coupon is checked by an automaton instead of the driver
The machines, which will be operational from tomorrow, are easy to operate.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the coupon you purchased will automatically be activated.
The electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
The suburban trains and buses with the numbers 300 to 499, which mainly carry residents of the municipalities of the Central Bohemian region, are used to reach the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport, the train attendants have readers that allow them to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone", explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid ticket control organisation, which compiles timetables for Prague's transport operators.
Suburban buses have map-reading devices at the cashier's desk.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but must be placed in a designated place at the side of the cash register.
This is used to check the validity of the coupons that have been used.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons that have been used, the easiest way is to ask the driver for this information", Drápal says.
A passenger who does not travel by suburban bus and does not know when the validity of the coupon will end can go to the vending machines where the coupons will be inserted on the card.
Here the information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had asked for the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is stated in a letter in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
It is with this wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have approached the US president in 1945.
This is shown, among other things, by a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Krumau Germans are asking the American President not to allow the return of the Sudetenland, which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement, to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", says a letter signed by the words "people who care about the fate of the Sudeten".
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia suggests to the Sudeten Germans - aware of the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume for today and forever the protectorate over the Bohemian Forest.
"We cannot believe that you, without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this territory, would accuse a state that is foreign to us, that oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President had any doubts about the attitude of the German in the Bohemian Forest, it would be enough for him to initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest region on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the US or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today's knowledge of postwar history, it nevertheless paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time, according to some contemporary witnesses.
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least suspect that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was stationed in the Baltic Sea as a German in the Navy.
When he was taken prisoner by the British at the end of the war and brought to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that if they came home, they would be able to speak Czech", Chalupa says.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected that they would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
If you don't think so, then pay!
An emotional campaign for motorists
The most expensive road safety campaign in Czech history.
This is another way of describing the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The government of Minister Aleš Řebíček is promising to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million kroner will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is designed to discourage speeding and alcohol-related driving.
And also remind them to put on their clothes before they get on the road.
The campaign is aimed at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what do the ads show?
Mostly stories about people appealing to emotion.
The campaign's "bloody" slogan is a testament to this:
If you don't think so, pay the price.
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay".
This is supposed to mean that one can pay for a moment of inattention with one's own life.
The commercials will shock viewers until 2010.
The Ministry drew inspiration from similar campaigns in the English speaking countries, where it is common to see images of accident victims with graphic images.
The number of accidents and road deaths on Czech roads is expected to decrease.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugarloaf and whip for the motorists
"The drivers are known as 'Candy and Whip.'
Sugarloaf means that when they drive on red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or of an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risks", says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the European Union is able to meet the demands of the citizens of the Union.
He believes that signs that alert drivers to danger are even less effective.
"If you put up a static sign warning of a danger, it will probably soon be absorbed into the environment and drivers will not notice it", says Kořán.
Olmert would give back almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The Chairman of the provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria can be made in return.
This he emphasized in an interview published by the Jediot daily Akhronot on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give a similar high percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without it", he added.
He acknowledged that any eventual return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over their legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templars and the holy and historical places" that lie on the territory of the Old Town.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work", he said.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert has called for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considers an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
'My proposal is not to make peace with Syria on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan Heights alone,' said Olmert.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to give up to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up their continued support for the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Qaeda terror network and the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident, are stewards on the bus illegal?
She doesn't know the law, you can't go around in a coach
The tragic accident of a bus belonging to the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, has raised the question of whether stewards and passengers are allowed to move around in the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the work of a steward is in contradiction with the law on road traffic", says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was probably caused by the truck driver crossing the bus.
The young woman was, unfortunately, sitting next to the driver, in the least secure seat in the car, although she had two other seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or stop sharply while the steward is serving coffee or newspapers.
It is also important to note whether the bus is equipped with standing places according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for in the bus, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; which the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has not at first approved the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back and we came to a consensus that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their seat", he shared his view.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legal provision describes this role.
However, there is no legal provision which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only defines the concept of a driver's assistant, but does not define his rights and duties", adds the Ministry spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Ministry of Transport's Road Vehicles Department, Josef Pokorný, however, believes that the law covers this problem after the fact.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing places in the product registration.
That's all there is to it", he emphasises.
Buses are divided into city buses with standing seats and a maximum speed limit, local buses with standing seats and a higher speed limit, and long-distance buses without standing seats with the highest speed limit and seats fitted with safety belts.
Like in the airplane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see the movement of stewards on a bus as a fundamental problem.
"There are few hazards in a fluid mode, which is comparable to a service on board an airplane.
"It's not safe here either, when turbulence comes and the stewardess can bump her head".
"If you're braking a bus, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The safety of stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations", he says, adding that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cut services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director doesn't consider her profession risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's job is risky, I'll remove it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs", he says.
Asiana's director Alexei Litvin explains the lack of stewards on his buses as a safety concern, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end with some kind of fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
It was an unbelievable tragedy.
The accident of a bus to Naples involved a young stewardess from the Pilsen region who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably veered off the road without even blinking and blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to evade the truck by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the truck with the right front end.
Jančura denied that the two seats for the stewards had been sold.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked".
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
The agency will not wait for the court's decision to award compensation to the family of the young woman, but will also expect financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change in the law?
Out of sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could lead to a legal regulation, on which a team of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, but rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says specialist Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that could seriously endanger the safety of the passengers", Hanzelka said, adding that the police and the occupational safety authorities are responsible for controlling the safety of buses.
Dusseldorf's hopes are in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB board to the staff of the House is full of big words.
The merger of the Düsseldorf-based Deka-Bank with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a 'competence block' with sustainable earning power into such a business.
The Commission also considered that the new rules would be in line with the new rules on the free movement of capital.
That's what it's like to be a board member who wants to demonstrate agency in a difficult time.
The WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
The Commission has been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the new rules on the financial services sector, which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The question of a link between Deka Bank, which is well known to savings bank customers for its investment funds, and WestLB has been discussed for some time - also in Frankfurt.
Deka Bank's CEO Franz Waas, when presenting the half-yearly figures at the end of August, did indeed say that he did not see any point in a merger of the bank on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka, which is half-owned by the Landesbanken and half-owned by the Savings Banks, has instructed the board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have only just begun, according to the Financial Times.
Deka Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important employers in the financial centre of Frankfurt, is not the first to be mentioned when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked as if Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But the three-way tie was a bust.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian government opposed Helaba's participation in them.
The other two houses also did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was instead transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been repeated speculations about a connection between Deka Bank and the Landesbanken.
However, Günther Merl, chairman of the board of Helaba, had recently spoken out against Planspiele's association with his house.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs for particular uses is a welcome step in this direction.
The first step in the process of linking BayernLB to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, now that the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria are over, could be to bring about a merger.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure builds to further mergers, you'll gradually leave the partners for it.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has so far far far better survived the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hessen-Thüringen Savings and Loan Association, which holds an 85% stake in Helaba, put a stop to the merger with West LB earlier this year.
I'd like to keep it at the Nord LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
The other is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Savings Bank and Giroverband had not yet answered the crucial question of which business model was to be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken.
The final outcome could be the dismantling of West LB, which is not desirable.
The letter from the local board of directors also mentions this, saying that a "comprehensive solution" for the house is in any case being sought.
How this can be reconciled with the Deka Bank by the merger of individual units remains to be seen.
The second weekend in Vienna is known as the "Italian weekend".
Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But this time Elena is his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, by the five-liter beer keg of the Kaiser brand, stands a massive bearded man, proving to the 200 or so Oktoberfest travelers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena slaps Luca in the face, then she kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus stop next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses will depart this evening at 11:45 p.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arriving at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, one bus is for Brazilians only.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing alongside their flag, having celebrated in the night.
And Marco Guarda says it's not for Italians.
Marco, wearing a long fur coat and wide silver-rimmed glasses, owns the buses.
They've been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, on the Wiesn in the daytime, back at 22:30 hours.
Staying over would only mean unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The fare is 75 euros, including the welcome pack with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity rules, health insurance and German-language travel guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are rolling into the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the passengers sleep.
Good, they'll need their strength.
Stops are in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates also stop on the Autobahn 8 just outside Munich.
When Marcos' group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m., as scheduled, the 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
The left side of the picture shows the wording "Oktoberfest" in Fraktur, and the web address of the Marcos travel agency is "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's time to run!" calls Marco into the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we'll block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to leave a tip.
"Show the security people we're behaving well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight at exactly half past ten, come back here!" Understood?
And now we're going to Wiesn.
Along the way, a yellow cap is tied to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian people's party as a waymark.
You want to be prepared for the retreat.
It's the second weekend in Vienna, known as the "Italian weekend".
There is no precise figure; there are 50 000 people crossing the Alps and entering the Beer tents, and 10% of all visitors are said to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, and Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps a national statistic in which the Italians are in first place, ahead of the British (about 60 missions) and the Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
The court bride's tent is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, said German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also added that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because it's been on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is listed on the Dax, is being given a billion-euro loan by a consortium of German banks to protect itself against the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate would only have to pay interest on the part it would also take.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses at the daughter Depfa.
The government funder had, according to a newspaper report, refinanced itself extremely short-term for long-term projects for which it had lent money - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, and its equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6% to 1.45%.
The current revenue and net revenue from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared with the previous year's period, while revenue from subscriptions to receivables and certain securities and from the liquidation of provisions in the credit business had fallen by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursement of downstream costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, from the reimbursement of interest under the tax system and from business support for group companies, the loss in revenue was still moderate at around 16%.
The former state-owned bank had, after its privatisation in 1990, initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been spun off into Aareal Bank.
As the traditional form of state financing was too low in terms of earnings, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public partnership (PPP)), and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate will now have to make write-offs which will have a 'substantial material effect' on the group's profit and loss account, it is said quite indefinitely.
The fact is, the dividend was written off.
For 2007, it had already been reduced by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the interbank market for refinancing, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely dried up as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to refinance a part of Depfa's loan portfolio - some EUR 50 billion - each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the loan will cover the group's financing needs for the foreseeable future and will protect the company 'from the impact of the international financial markets, which are currently largely inoperative'.
Other sources say that the funds have secured the refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE's CEO, Georg Funke, stated that, on the other hand, the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the market viability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what shareholders and creditors of the bank are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, I think there is no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that the financing may not be used in full.
But the opposite is also not to be ruled out.
The Bank was still facing bankruptcy late on Sunday evening, and even the temporary rescue was unable to calm the mood.
The share price falls by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up quite well.
While the price of senior debt was little affected, the price of subordinated debt fell more sharply.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are the main ones affected.
The value of these bonds, which had only been brought home by the crisis by the takeover of Depfa, must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system, given the sharp deterioration of the banking crisis and the institution itself.
As long as central banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are still willing to support the system, the expectation is that the interest rates will be paid off on time.
Or it will happen, something that few people dare to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the reports of partial nationalisation, the probability of a possible breakthrough has now become a legitimate hope.
This should give long-term creditors, in particular, some sleepless nights as to whether they should part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a line to form a loss carry-over for future depreciation tax payments on stock gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is asked to introduce herself on her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: "German is so kawaii!"
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a problem with it before I even went to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, in the direction of Kawasaki, and it's a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way by myself, but luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the lessons at Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly regulated as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students come in from eight o'clock until a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room', at twenty-nine.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have a school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, a blouse, blue knee-length trousers and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I stood in front of the counter and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language two years earlier.
The 31 girls in the class were all giggling and giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It is part of the Japanese girls' vocabulary and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly settled into my seat.
The girl next to me had a pretty big grin, and she thought it was an honor to have the exchange student sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really startled.
Everyone was talking in confusion and giggling and asking me about holes in my stomach - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mother had made me a lunchbox like this one - it's something different from the desolate German bread for the holidays.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu.
I usually have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste like nothing you've ever seen.
I'm sure it's all very good.
Well, except for the salted prunes, brrrr!
Bentos are not just a lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl will give a boy a homemade bento, which she then makes very artfully - hoping to get to know the boy better during the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm wondering if I can watch this too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me".
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to understand the comics and the culture better, I also started learning a little bit of Japanese.
So it was clear to me that I had to come here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen".
Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach flees when in danger. Does that mean they feel fear too?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings too.
But how could you tell if they feel the same way if they're behaving the same way as us?
The online journal Edge has been publishing contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove this before, since we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of sense or consciousness in general, we're entering a very difficult terrain because the hardware is not compatible.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing that many other animals do - it kills itself, runs away, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, leading some scientists to suggest a similar subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there's reason to believe that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is tied to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness was independent of language, it would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its makeup, would likely be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
So it's hard to say what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If it is something internal and subjective, which cannot be measured or, because of the special hardware, analysed by our own experience, then its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of what I've said is about the content of conscious experience, but there's another aspect of consciousness that might be easier to access scientifically.
You could study the conscious processes of animals without regard to their content, and that's exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But this approach, which was pursued by Christoph Koch and Francis Crick, is more about the neural correlates of consciousness than the causal mechanisms, whether they are identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the development of visualization.
What does that say about the sensations?
I trace it back to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defence system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
So, in this sense, sensations are closely tied to the regions of the cortex that are characteristic of primates, and especially humans.
Connected with the nature of language, there are subtle gradations of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states, to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the body-sensory regions of the cortex and the brain stem, similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network hasn't changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-genre feelings.
I cannot disagree with this in theory, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to feel like fear in both cases: But how can we test whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees when in danger, but does it also feel fear?
In my eyes, mere similarity of behavior is not proof of similarity of experience.
And the neural comparison helps us a lot, because rats and humans have similar brainstems, but mice don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it in humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours -- human consciousness is based on special circuits and language -- I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional sensations in rats.
But at least here, progress is showing up at the neural level, if you measure the same in rats and humans.
I don't study language or consciousness in rats, and I don't study feelings, so I don't know if they exist.
This may seem short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than keep running into walls.
I'm a practical emotionalist, you know.
UEFA President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vashunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championships together with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is much to be done in both countries".
The two hosts are lagging behind in terms of the time needed to build or renovate stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It may even reduce the number of EM stages from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at full speed", said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian federation.
"UEFA will be watching us constantly".
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN Association has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee following numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have written to Uefa president Michel Platini to assure him that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer".
Several first division players had been sentenced to forced relegation in the last season alone for manipulation, eventually even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
The indignant Dennis Quaid is fighting back.
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke about personal in the interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her ex-husband Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He's frothing - and he's fighting back.
Late Rose Wars with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an ugly fight with each other - in public.
Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the marriage's failure in an interview with InStyle magazine last week. "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful", he said.
She said she didn't find out about the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adulterer is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as a cheating husband was clear: "It's disingenuous", the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg is re-reading and rewriting the history of our relationship".
It is also "deplorable" that their 16-year-old son, Jack, is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that divorce brings to every child".
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so he ends his introductions with the side-snap: "My life is going on anyway.
I feel blessed to have a wonderful family who are doing well".
Airline and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights have become up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and hotel stays have become cheaper again, according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its accounting data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant drop in the second quarter after a rise in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities studied still rose by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
But from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express blames the weak dollar for the decline, which has led to "a decline in the enthusiasm of American tourists".
The report also points out that financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In fact, hotel prices in the Norwegian city have risen by 26.3 percent, setting a European record.
The trend in airfares also continued to rise in the first quarter:
The price of fuel for the economy class was 7.1% higher than in 2007, and for the long-haul fuel-intensive class, 29.2%.
From April to June, economy class prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, but business and first class prices changed much less.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
The study found that prices on German domestic flights have even been cut in half.
The company explains that the price drop is due to the slowdown in economic growth.
Demand is declining in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
The stress situation was reflected in the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines and the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008, 24 of which were in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach by one to zero.
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes leader of the table.
At the Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning elf.
From Kristoffer Klein, enlarge the landing of the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came late into the game and failed to hit the rack with a lever.
His message was precise, it was on his lips with conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger whispered in the lobby of the Hamburger Arena.
Not much was going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was physiotherapist to the HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than many of the actors involved.
And so his plea was heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His order is to have sounded similarly: Come with gate two!
The implementation was not carried out.
"It wasn't all pretty to look at today", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more relaxed.
The 1-0 (1:0) Hamburgers have to thank the head-ball hit of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory", Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flashing sign on the video screen that declared their club the winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim evidence of the tables is more for the unpredictability of the League than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-committed entries - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the FC Bayern-drafted Jansen - is slow, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbling", Jol demanded.
After the vote was lost
Wall Street is running scared.
Initial news of the bailout's failure caused the Dow Jones to drop 700 points at times.
That was the biggest one-day point loss in his history.
Later, the Dow got a little bit of a boost.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down by a good five percent at 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The biggest losers at that time were the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No title could be added.
Goldman Sachs' stock was down by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, a major investor, Warren Buffett, had bought a stake in the company.
The rescue plan is to provide funds for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage securities.
The amount is not to be paid out all at once, but in stages.
In return, the State should receive stock options of the financial companies, which could be redeemed in the event of a corresponding price development, in order to reduce the burden on the State Treasury.
Shares in Europe and the US down
The billions in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not remove the doubts of investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the Dax down.
The Dow Jones index is losing despite the government's planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses at Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The stock of the Munich real estate financier temporarily lost three quarters of its value, Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent, despite the bailout by the Federal Government and private banks.
The DAX clearly fell below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark, scoring a minus 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets were in a state of collapse.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout might not be enough to get financial markets back on track.
The Dow dropped 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives was to vote on the bailout plan, which the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also followed a single course: in London the FTSE index initially fell by 3.2 per cent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 2.1 percent to 18,286.90.
In India, the Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 cents.
In the MDax, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed the 23 million new shares.
The trading and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter is affecting spacecraft flight .
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter interferes with the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts are concerned that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity may not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
With fuel lines soon to freeze, you are now facing the prospect of death by cold.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver by spacecraft to gain momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This can save the spacecraft a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
But what has puzzled scientists for years is that the rockets do not behave 100 percent as you would expect from the ancient law of gravity.
The Commission has not yet been able to put forward a proposal for a directive on the transport of dangerous goods.
The probes are getting faster or slower than expected.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They named it Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton remains firmly convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and he is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly by using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have mapped out in the universe.
"The cause of the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth", he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about a decade.
It evidently exerts a force of attraction that can be observed in its effect on other celestial bodies.
It is completely invisible, that is, it neither emits nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially not visible light.
After all, scientists have calculated that dark matter makes up about one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
The Italian Foreign Minister has confirmed that the tourists who were taken to Egypt will be free after spending ten days in the hands of their captors.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded several million euros in ransom.
Six hostages were reportedly killed in a shootout before the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Ransom negotiations are said to be underway.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is a list of the most important cases.
The European tourists who were abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic Al-Arabiya TV channel and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, as reported by Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are checking her health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian woman, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and well, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are reported to be on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers by surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", said the official.
He said that "the hostages were just being taken in", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom reported, citing a German mediator, that the hostages' release was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers are planning to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by Stepfather "led to Suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman's suicide, a court has been told.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was given a six-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly handcuffed his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
In a confession, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for her death".
The court has learned that Mrs Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away working in a tavern.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs Randle, who volunteered much of her time for the National Trust, was being pursued for abuse, which had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Ms. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "surrendered her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by choking herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with, "I used to tie her up and blindfold her".
"I did not sexually assault her.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen said of Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for your victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so".
He added: "I take note of the impact that Stephanie's father and mother described their actions having on their daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a very promising, successful and happy young woman".
Official charged with lost data
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who lost top secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was a deputy from the Ministry of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It's the weakest indictment in the law and there's no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action came as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally in the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet".
The employee, whose name cannot be released, is being charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that deals with the safe storage of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he leaked contained classified assessments of al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing companies are looking at B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than £80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government has made £14 billion available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all the companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The general director of the BSA, Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" for the companies and their members to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford and Bingley's loans are paid off.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions which have behaved prudently are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions which have been far less prudent.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 85.
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would keep and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies will have to raise £81 million for the interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, the general director of the Association of Housing Associations, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have been careful during the real estate boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs by those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since records began in 1945.
"We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing associations and their members from potentially significant costs".
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September to the end of March of that year.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and could be almost double that.
Since construction companies are bilateral organizations with no partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk is going up five pence a litre
The people of Jersey are faced with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence a litre from Monday.
It's the second price hike this year, following a two-pence increase in February, and comes after research by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they wish to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the last change in the wholesale price of Jersey Milk was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court denied bail in connection with the charge of blackmailing a businessman for 50 million taka ($729,700) while she was prime minister.
This is one of several pending corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the military-backed transitional government grant her full freedom first.
The correspondents say that although her probation was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, as part of her release it is unclear whether she will be able to remain free on her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the Supreme Court's decision to the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail application because it says she does not need to be granted bail as she is already in detention condition abroad to be treated abroad", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will appeal to the Supreme Court".
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami League party chairman said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations last week launched a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses its case against ITV
BskyB has lost its appeal against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously alleged that BskyB's share distorted competition and enabled it to exercise unfair influence over ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom, the communications agency, have all spoken out against the deal.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, particularly since BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US prosecutor case
The US Attorney General has assigned a special investigator to look into the resignation of nine US attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, which criticized the actions of the administrative staff.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now being asked to determine whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators to obstruct justice.
Serious allegations, including criminal misconduct, have not been fully investigated or resolved, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
One of his main recommendations was to appoint a special investigator with the authority to compel witnesses to testify.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been sentenced any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of Democratic vote-rigging.
US attorneys are charged with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but they may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has come under fire for the dismissals and has effectively resigned.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was particularly critical of Gonzales' role in the dismissals, claiming that he was 'mainly responsible' for the dismissals, 'renounced' his leadership role and 'extremely disinterested' in the process.
Other officials, including former President Bush's chief adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for their lack of cooperation with investigators.
♪ Meat Loaf 's epic song should be honored ♪
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will be receiving his special gold award at the awards ceremony in London next week, said he was honoured to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay is leading the nominations for this year's awards, having been shortlisted in four categories.
Q Magazine editor Paul Rees said that there are some songs that transcend such things as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful vocal, which was provided by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 in the charts.
Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent nine years on the charts and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute laryngitis.
Later it was revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in the city, often forgotten and possibly soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of thoroughfares, alleys, side streets, and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others merely convenient.
Yet, even experienced taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used driveway.
There are no street signs either.
It's practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street has its admirers, though.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-paving Extra Place to create a clean driveway to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the longtime neighborhood, who says they are fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remnants of the block's past.
But the city department responsible for the protection and construction of the housing and the road has no interest in preserving it.
During a meeting of the City Council's Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the road to be purchased by the construction company.
Still, the committee prefers the road to remain in the city's hands and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager for City Council 3.
"Only a very small amount of space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to remain in the city's possession", she said.
"There could be suggestions on how to repair and operate the road, which could be handled by Avalon, but we also want to ensure that public access is guaranteed".
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would re-pave the small street and install seating for a café, among other things, to which the company plans to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and turn it into a public gathering place", she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said that the city actually wanted to sell the street, emphasizing that the department's job was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood, The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical feel.
Some believe that the street was named in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock landmark that closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is probably best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was littered with scrap, rags, and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity  a virtually unchanged fragment of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog "Jeremiah's vanishing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), has published a portion of the talk of urban history on Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and week-old newspapers flying past rain gutters".
With few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this one evening recently.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store now stands.
Graffiti was visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle was lying on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of old newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested the street could be polished a bit.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark and damp and disgusting.
The debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a coauthor of Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice.
Addressing the Hispanic electorate is a complicated task.
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are a typical example.
Obama's campaign notes that "African-American and Hispanic students are less likely to graduate than white students" - which is true.
To close this achievement gap, Obama's education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition in education for those who are learning English for the first time.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, is inconsistent with his interest in reducing the achievement gap.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles, for example.
Most of the students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived in the country, are learning English.
Yet, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-graders passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Also surprising, 93 percent of the fourth-grade children scored well on the English test.
This amazing success has been achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant scrutiny of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
The school also has an approach of teaching in an English-speaking environment, which is precisely the point Obama should be aware of, according to school director Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasises the almost exclusive use of English in the teaching of specialised subjects.
Mrs Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, and that 12 months later, you would walk into the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works", she remarked, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with large percentages of Hispanic and other English-language learners?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (the national education associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You're supposed to make sure your kid can speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close the achievement gap, he should carefully consider models of education that work, rather than belittle and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as concerns about the economy are renewed
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil trading on the New York Stock Exchange was down 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by over $20
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and by powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month, only to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were once again worried, despite congressional officials announcing that they had agreed to a bailout over the weekend, which was to be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest chapter of the growing crisis, a government announcement Monday that Citigroup will buy the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems to have failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
In a note to investors, Deutsche Bank analysts said that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they write, that the commodity markets will also be affected.
"From a commodity market perspective, our biggest concern is whether the US virus is spreading globally, especially to China".
The Bank's analysts have revised downwards their expectations for oil consumption for the coming year, due to weak economic growth, and have cut their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Center Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all, after being caught in the Jets uniform more than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a triumphal parade.
"I've never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was due to bad weather, the second quarter began.
But when quarterback Brett Favre's pass to Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving partnership took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one as a quarterback slipping and the other 10 seconds before halftime.
"I didn't try very hard", Coles said of the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a great player.
Our vote was right, no matter what people think".
As Favre and Coles played catch, defensive quarterback Kurt Warner took over.
Outfielder Darrelle Revis intercepted a fumble and converted it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens then provided a loss to Warner.
That last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recovered the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-yard shot to take a 34-to-nothing lead.
That's the most points the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
Asked to describe the insanity, Jets coach Erik Mangini replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When asked if he liked both, because the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time".
A rested baby-beater beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown once again why some consider him the greatest long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to complete the 42.2-kilometer distance in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in a varied career in which he has won at least one world title or set a world record on every distance from the mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that the air pollution might worsen his asthma problems, which was perhaps exaggerated in retrospect.
Instead, he's signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sunshine and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya switched to long distance, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last 10 years, since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently, he came back refreshed after a break, not rusty.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and I had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great".
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rivals - for orchestrating his races excessively, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying too heavily on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism does little to diminish Gebrselassies' stature as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the midpoint of the distance in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pace makers had slowed down.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made his final attempt to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now a German, completed a remarkable year by setting the seventh fastest time of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff of Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games due to problems that were described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her run well, putting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners in the race, but overtaking them after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came in third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the struggle of the black population in a city of a very special kind.
Hidden among the excesses of the Orlando area's amusement parks, a few miles from the glittering, noisy, gigantic bustle, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of African-American culture are on display.
Eatonville, the first all-black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the town with 5 lakes, 3 croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough caves, 2 schools and no jail".
Nowadays it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the town she describes - which she made a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writer's Project during the Depression - is and remains in many ways a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing".
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about race relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told", said Hortense Jones, 59, a native of the city and a parishioner of the city's oldest church.
It must be true".
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 people with a poverty rate twice the national average.
It is a bastion of literature on the one hand, and an example of the sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, black culture of the rural South, rooted in American slavery, on the other.
It's not surprising that the people here are both proud and wary.
And so the concern about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in the mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is located very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the theaters of black history and human drama.
Freaky as Oscar in real life and literature, Hurston led Leser to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Across the street to the left", she wrote, "is the brown-and-white-painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can barely read and write".
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever-ever fits the hours".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
This was definitely not a guidebook.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were", said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston, quoting the men singing songs about their beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people did not like this".
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into town in a hurry, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something of its venerable dress style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the townspeople were fascinated, but many were disgusted.
"People were always glad to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
"But she never stayed too long", he added as he rocked in his chair on a back-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary of Langstin Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There were no big commemorations in Eatonville, no public readings in a big way.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy in the slightest", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a 2003 biography of Hurston.
The turning point came in the '80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane highway.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950's, the struggle against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"In those days a lot of white boys would come in and throw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the sidelines", said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car".
In 1955, Hurston wrote to the Orlando Sentinel questioning the Supreme Court's call to enforce integration, calling its decision in Brown v. School Board "insulting rather than respectful of my race".
Residents now say that while the removal of segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening", says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural divide", Ms. Nathiri said.
But civil rights helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons -- black writers, actors and artists who overcame prejudice as she did, with positive self-esteem and statements like, "How can anyone deny themselves the joy of my company!
I don't understand it at all".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out to find Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight to restore her fame.
Five years later, a much-lauded biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, making her part of the American literary canon once again.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The town began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could do with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway brought the city to life, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, and created a real sense of civic pride", said Ms Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the long-distance road project has contributed to a change in the city's image.
More and more train wreckers came, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who's been attending church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new single-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a distinctive part of Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders seeking to learn about the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior approval, and certain things - such as the mural at Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man depicting black men working in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a penchant for dark-skinned, still fear that her secluded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival was growing, so was an increased sense of pride in one's hometown.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, no better or worse, and just as proud, creative and industrious, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in city government or the police, who he says could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville right.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon the other day after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, we speak fluent Latin for finance.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to turn away from the newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not even realize that they were in the midst of a debacle.
You would never believe that, above their heads, in their shoe-box-like offices with the glass facades, the bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York have the worst horror workday since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers are still loudly clapping as they push the metal tea carts along sidewalks and carry muffin-laden tablets for the breakfast seating.
Latinos still shuffle between apartments like human pack animals loaded with 50 ironed T-shirts suspended from a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagels at the sidewalk food stalls, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, when all this doomsday talk made me decide to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to leave my duty in the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cash desk to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order cheque books, tourists ask for directions to Macy's, and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal licensed bank clerk", were standing in line for the same reason I was standing in line.
But unlike me, they had already taken their savings from smaller banks in places they commuted from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken money from what they called thrifts, cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, and they say they treat their customers like family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went into receivership, and as New Yorkers drove home for the weekend last Friday, Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion in savings, was looking for a rescue buyer.
Fearful of another collapse, the office and store employees in the queue before me took their cash to a bank considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of the bailout purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have been embracing fluent financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who called at my Chinese supermarket made a familiar reference to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank and its emaciated-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were slandering a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-something uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has moved away from our usual conversations about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I have now put all my savings into money market funds", she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed my mind, I'm not taking any more risks".
Muslim graves desecrated during a legal landslide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing party Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organisation Cities against Islamisation.
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs, with a mosque, crossed with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a grave at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right parties are making significant gains in the country's parliamentary elections.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were damaged in the cemetery in Traun near Linz in what police say was an organized action.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but law enforcement officials believe this was an attempt to obscure the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way connected to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Muslim community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the grave desecration, which took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan draws to a close.
At the same time, Austria is facing a round of soul-searching after the country's rightward slide in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, called for a ban on headscarves and burqas and even expressed his aversion to foods commonly associated with Islam.
In his last speech in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the far right is the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
External travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been barred from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel via France to Spain.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after they presented evidence to judges of Glitter's prior convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court reported: 'On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent Police requested permission from the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not in person".
As required by the sex offender registry, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he intended to travel abroad.
He has to notify the authorities if he wants to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before he plans to leave.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of up to five years.
Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for the Kent Police Service said: "The Kent police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country and abroad".
"We believe it is easier to monitor someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks".
"The Kent Police's primary concern is to protect the people of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county to minimise any risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities refused to let him pass through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
He finally arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, after Scotland Yard successfully applied for permission to require him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed for 4 months in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
According to the Home Office, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter has been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"I perceive the master behind the scenes to capture his character".
No heels, no wrinkles, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers, who forego concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private lives, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the gestures that are typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands that are worried because they won't be able to step on stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents the varied theatricality of some stagings on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month programme, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day', explains the artist, and makes it clear that 'Flamenco people' can be any person, but when looking at the photos, the viewer will notice that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
The ordinary people in the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
I was interested in creating a personal atmosphere which would enable me to use my camera to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters.
Inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', Bauer set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's image-sorting function and the material available, images were created that are reminiscent of classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the picture, which gives the picture modernity and the idea, as the peasant understands flamenco: ∀music with traditional roots, which changes and surprises every day'.
It is not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next period in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as `portraits of veterans of sport' (`SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives to 'I really like to photograph people, get to know them and put myself in their life, whether for a short moment or for a longer period.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or bump into people, personalities that you don't know sometimes at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes so they can take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to make my ideas come true.'
The collection of portraits of the flamenco of today, entitled 'Flamenco-people', is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, located in the street called la calle de la Mata and running parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is "a foolishness".
He does not know where the novel is set and what it is about, but he is trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, while attending the Hay Festival in Segovia, the favourite Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is working on 'is a foolishness' and 'everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
∀If I were sane, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel some day', he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most prominent personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's premium and to whom most of the audience gave their voices, is compared to the old edition of ∀Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo Theater.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose from an extraordinary desire for adventure, from the joy of reading and from wanting to experience more than what comes before; how he writes and observes discipline, to supplement his lack of inspiration, his intensive work with documentation, the numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how his vocation was influenced by people like Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro D and which images form the basis for his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that 'there is no way to measure and know whether books change lives', but 'I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who says that it 'produces effects' and 'makes people more divided', so I asked the writer 'not to be too easy' and 'to take responsibility for his vocation'.
The weather was not a factor in the festival in Pozoblanco, with bullfights being cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the floor of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, which was supposed to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
The organisers, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, have decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus the festival was exposed to the unstable weather, and two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The matador group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the bullfighting arena one by one.
So there was only one party on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante struck two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had accomplished more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted to his second fight with boo-hoo.
In Álava, two persons tried to escape control of their car loaded with 2,000 kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes to ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the municipality of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen ordered the car drivers to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, a 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., according to the Basque Interior Ministry.
The person arrested was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the Álava region traffic police officers had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to conduct a routine check, but the driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased his speed and tried to evade the control.
The police began the chase until the car stopped at the border strip after a few kilometers, at which point the drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road into a wooded area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught one of the two, in a car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with bundles of hashish, which were later sent to other police stations for detailed laboratory analysis and weighing.
The officials also found that the license plate was 'duplicated', so that it did not match the license plate shown in the vehicle's papers, which led to an additional arrest for forgery of official documents.
The police of the town of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as mentioned, managed to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for questioning and will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear has been arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, best known for her role as Amanda on the TV series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness witnessed her trying to drive out of her parking space in Montecito in a strange manner, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness detailed that after 4:30 p.m. Locklear was accelerating and making a lot of noise trying to move her car backwards or forwards from the parking space, and as she drove backwards she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear pull up on a nearby road and get out of the car.
The witness was the one who called 911 because she was worried about Locklears.
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was blocking the road.
'She seemed to be disoriented', so they took the officers to a special drug and alcohol testing centre.
"According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, and excessive consumption of alcohol was ruled out from the start". "Following initial observations by officers, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug", the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and taken to a local precinct at approximately 7:00 p.m.
Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital two months ago after treatment for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and a member of the United Left, today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former city councillor for youth and sports of the Seville City Hall, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
∀In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one that has to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the way the party must approach the one who is still a city councillor in Seville.
Nevertheless, the VL chairman defended the need for transparency in the possible investigations of the violations that Silva could have initiated: "The VL has always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency".
In this context, he stressed that education has 'a strict code of ethics for all public offices'.
♪ Sangre de mayo, the heroic book of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodios Nacionales, José Luis Carci's Sangre de Mayo is a revised version of the famous Spanish revolt against the French, a film that is admirable in its cinematography, with an investment of around 15 million euros in the filming.
In this way, the cineast has tried to 'represent a lot of personalities and social analysis' that he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
'Sangre de mayo', a film of more than two and a half hours, will be shown in cinemas this Friday and later on the Telemadrid channel as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, says that this film fulfilled his childhood dream, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago was commissioned by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the bicentennial celebrations on November 2 in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, paid by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for the filming, gave Garci, as he added, the 'unique opportunity' to 'represent, with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of a Spain in confusion, which had chosen the wrong leader for the struggle because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that it could not count on the funding of `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as `Sangre de mayo') and therefore some scenes from the script could not be filmed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in 'Volver a empezar', contributed in his usual way: he took the stage to the actors with whom one has to rehearse before starting to shoot and for those who had not done a casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and respectful, 'part of the job of a film director is to help in the theatre and in the cinema, to know what is happening in the industry in which one works in cinema'.
Many of the actors he meets in 'Sangre de mayo' have to rehearse in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, who has been nominated for four Oscars (one of which he won), said that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a younger generation of Spanish filmmaking: neither "Sangre de mayo", "Siete mesas de billar francés" and finally, the selected film "Los girasoles ciegos".
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this film.
∀At first you think you are working for the future, then you realise that it is just for the future, and now you are satisfied that you have produced another film', explains Garci after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville is worshiping a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she is born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars.
I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible.'
∀We're not trying to tell about her life without preserving her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance background helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, the 'dance of the butterfly' seemed to me like the guajira, or the 'dance of the snake' like the tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic realm,' she claims.
The production is expected to feature two exceptional collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her former pupils as an exception.
Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature character.
I am happy that she has agreed to share in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he ≠assumes the role of the companion of the artists who were the Divas with whom he fell in love again and again.'
This work also tells in a certain way the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also in all of Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who had a huge impact on a certain era and whose work is no longer appreciated today and therefore even less appreciated,' says Bayón.
The show is at the Lope de Vega Theater at 8:30 tonight.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also marks the end of the triennium.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides a suitable atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón (2006-2008) with the aim of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the day of death of both.
The 'Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium' concludes with the new edition of this work, the international congress in New York, the restoration of the Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia House Museum and the travelling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel Pío de Luz', which opened in May and, after having visited various places in Andalusia, has now reached New York and will be presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture also received 800 copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the personality and work of the Andalusian world poet.
The United States is a mess without Paul Newman.
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Sensational Reporter", and from the then dominant idea of American cinema, which was being abandoned all over America until Newman came along with his enthusiastic idea and followed it.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a big blow for everyone.
'What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest drills of his life.'
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or of overreacting.
As the father of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in a time of fear of terrorism and the collapse of the market, in which the crushed self-esteem of the American people is in desperate search of reasons to regain dignity.
If in these hard times without virtue there are few people left to admire, then you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as gains, from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs, created in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift to the country where he worked so hard to fight a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of wonder is sweeping Hollywood regardless of nationality or citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not just one person died, but the whole era.
English film director and Oscar winner Sam Mendes said that working with Newman was the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'Unus has left the greatest of us all', said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dares to live today as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high standards of integrity, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
That's not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are people who are trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, though there were certainly many possibilities of not being.
∀Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?' he often joked himself.
In heaven, he'll be proud that his daughters on earth share his fan's opinion, which is not necessarily the norm in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, none were more proud than those of faithful husband, loving father, attentive grandfather and philanthropist,' they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, it may be in 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say it's not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my judgment, it was the worst road with all the twists and turns that there was.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, but if you were to take the rating and I could look at it, it would clearly not have gone through.
But let's go through it from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket-taking, which allows you to go first.
I don't think it's bad either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including a chip to avoid traffic jams).
I'm not going to.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is to go there just for that) and (after an endless queue) there's the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size 'S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where are we living?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, well, things like this are a petty thing compared to the days on the street.
Besides the fact that you have to go in very early to get the chip, there's already a 15-minute queue and, besides, you have to leave the backpack behind.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if we had succeeded once, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
Moreover, the 40-minute wait was so full of rain that the temptation arose to organize a riot and raid the cottage.
I think tomorrow, there will be 500 people with pneumonia and some of them, like me, will not even show up for the classification in time because of this chip I have, and I can imagine that the exit was stamped wrong.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, that road would never come to mind.
So I think we'll have a long dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympics.
I'm looking for a virtual Microsoft receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference' hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of its new image recognition and human interaction system, an artificial intelligence being without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a route planner to move around the company's campus), that pays attention to what it hears during conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face-recognition system, this receptionist can tell how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember what they were wearing, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also assign the participants to the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group who is talking to her, and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
That 's impressive .
This is the future, for sure.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week there was very superficial talk about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many built-in programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the bare essentials instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would run five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added some functionality and 'Extras' in Windows versions.
Changing Directions Is Worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is losing its relevance, as is the software.
When Google Chrome first appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many of them were very clever in pointing out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work together.
The operating system has a function comparable to that of a husband or a wife in communicating with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never go away, but you have to think of your own death not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of that idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the environment of the 'johnwindow'.
What is half of the applications in the computer for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 has to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
It's lighter, not so over the top, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council.
This is a picture of this place that I took in Redmond, in one of the rec rooms for Microsoft employees earlier this month.
The refreshment vending machine has a sign: 'Your search, our future'.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for web searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not be published at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, or even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it is also the clothing of a well-built priest.
When we start counting the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man with a pointed beard who had lifted heavy weights in a traveling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailored.
The English call it `tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, is superior to all other brands.
First, because of its great name, even though it is called `Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend says that the name originated with sport and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
∀MarcelLa' stands out because of its excellent cotton, its distinctive unisex cut and the small (hardly recognizable) Belgian flag, which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'zero tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigan and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, baby, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's a shame to use it as underwear.
You are very charming.
I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate.
Her big show with her sister didn't stop her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joy.
The Gruz brothers are taking their new career in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, it means much more than it does for some pretty rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris promoting the company Mango, then moved her residence and also makes the presentation of the main prizes in fashion, sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short haul.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of the `Mango Fashion Awards and participated in the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense work schedule, but also exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what's the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress, combine their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but ultimately, it all comes together and these areas have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I was fascinated by clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's house, to look through my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of the clothes.
You know, we dancers love to have our own style in class and rehearsal, to look in the mirror and feel good about ourselves.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real actor's role.
Finally, it all comes together, it's like, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, haven't you had a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman is growing up, has experience, and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've been doing the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid, and it's given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I've known for a long time that I'm going to be a mother because my body wants me to be a mother, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise him with much love.
As for the art of film, you keep in mind the works in which you participated and which were shot last year.
That is exactly what they are, and I would very much like to see them presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, I'm very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course can not be immediately.
I would very much like to see 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' performed for the first time.
See how you like it
A few days ago, you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, is that correct?
Don't say that.
It's not like I went on the catwalk to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I've known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we're showing, and I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are many things said about her, but I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they are not true.
I'll still support this good cause she's involved in.
She asked me to join her in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to do a handstand, I'll do that, too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever it takes.
Drivers who may fall back because of the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcollock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who has had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car while drunk. If he is drunk, the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the Attorney General's report, which they say is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he receives a course for re-educating traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, it is also known that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will be involved.
Statistics show that between 30 and 75% of drivers who have been cited more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol have returned to the wheel.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver has had an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found that is higher than that allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, and the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the infringements in the first year of its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And to facilitate their implementation, statutory reform can be achieved through the usual means, and yet requires a reform of the Basic Law, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market, in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will be voting tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses.
In Mexico and no peep-toes
At exactly 17:40 British time, the time scheduled by the programme, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias, landed next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport.
The sun was setting, but its rays still forced the hand to use as an umbrella to see the royal couple who got off the plane.
Directly at the gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of day.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- That's right.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Marines who are giving out an ointment.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without the usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she has been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in which the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them, who likes to make jokes.
The best of the fashion world
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no more eminent fashion designer and bon vivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the 'Botón-Mango Fashion Adwards' fashion competition to promote and promote young fashion talents internationally.
The prize is a cash prize of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the shop window of the Mango branch at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest store of the company in Europe and it was recently opened, with a sales area of 1335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened connected with this that we would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair in the competition, and it all ended with a luxurious dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
Surrounded by many famous people, the executive table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart, broken by the pain of his brother's recent death, he pulled himself together, wearing the suit from the fashion house and some of the ELAH jewelry that was breathtaking, holding on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has accompanied Valentino to the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house of Mango, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier that he and the Baron de Rothschild ended up without jackets, because the ladies had borrowed them.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the store, wearing a pair of pants and a shirt that she had made herself, and for dinner she wore a long, sexy black dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a ballet rehearsal room, so she got excited, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a kind of ∀grand plie.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone.
The next morning we were pleased to have Oliver Martínez, a personality that always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, after arriving (with his own bed linen and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry skies of Paris.
Oh la la, that's the way of life.
1001 Counselling against stress
There are not a thousand, but one more way to forget the chaos of our daily lives.
And even though there are few, they are all collected in a book that tells you how to relax, and the book will be available in bookstores on September 30.
The alarm is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that life demands.
The office is the tension and the computer that cause the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of how to disconnect from the world of work.
But the number is rising, no more and no less than to 1,001.
In addition to yoga postures, the classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to each individual's tastes and time.
The work against stress is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and so the peace that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as the workplace through personal contact, this handbook refutes such a belief.
In addition, the methods are offered to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes are suggested, which lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops racing to restore balance to your body and stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your brain and focus on your reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night
I am not talking about the children who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who talk in their sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, you'll be shocked at best, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep talking.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, during a high fever) or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), and the child may not remember anything the next day.
There is no single cause that causes this phenomenon.
Often, associations are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis, sleep talking, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overstrain.
Anyway, this is a little-studied phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it may be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted by a specialist to check whether there is a problem that is causing anxiety and is thus brought about.
We've said that it's a positive disorder, so it's not being treated, whether it's related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is to take a series of simple precautions:
Try not to excite the child before he goes to sleep.
So choose quiet play for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are horrible and a little too wild.
For nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them to gain a measure of inner calm.
This helps the child to sleep peacefully.
If sleep talking occurs, try to keep calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child and the next day he won't remember anything that happened.
Helpful Advice for the Young
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because the child is unconscious, so you'll tear it out of sleep.
Although the child is talking, he is sleeping, so he is resting.
Remember, if it shows fear after a few appearances, it is recommended to seek counseling or to find out what the reason is for the child's fear.
If they understand what is said (which is not so common), the child will not be pressured to conduct an interrogation and to get more information.
You will not be able to achieve anything by doing so, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Also, you'll hear what he's saying, but you won't know what he's dreaming and why he's saying it, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe don't tell the kid that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It's a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's not a bad thing, it's a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Houses of illusion ... at last
After a long drought, Illhäusern is finally back on track.
Without much effort, the yellow and black players created numerous chances to score and managed to convert one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skill, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot just passed the corner, Illhäusern should easily dominate the game, and it was possible alternately first Fonderflick with a long-range shot, then Hirn with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the toe tip, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, only allowing the lively Riahi to lead the way.
The start of the second half should be decisive with first two goals scored by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately after with the first goal for the Illhausers by Marais, who was just right to take a ball back that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the ill-tempered goalkeeper was not to enjoy his luck for long and was sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, forcing his teammates to continue playing outnumbered.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not pose any major problems to an Illhausish elf, who only withdrew a little to consolidate their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball passed very close to the bar after a great mess.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another stop in Brittany.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'in a constructive spirit' and hoped that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit coincides with a general assembly of the crisis committee set up by Breton fishermen to implement measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record average of over EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the President will 'discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses become competitive again and to safeguard the working conditions and pay of the seafarers'.
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, causing congestion almost six miles long.
The Quiberon sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Île were not cut off.
The Quiberon Peninsula was surrounded by a barrier.
On Monday, sailors showed their determination by burning tyres and pallets in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the fishing boats were not leaving, or Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique have lifted the blockade of the major Total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer delegation decided to wait for the outcome of the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give in on any issue' and 'they will not go to Paris', declared Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel are currently paying about 50 cents a litre, but they believe that the margin of profitability of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents a litre.
Paul Newman the wonderful
The unforgettable actor from "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died at the age of 83 from complications of cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes all said their goodbyes to movie legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects to deliver 215 planes this year, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, is meeting its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high expectations for the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft with a capacity of between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the American International Group, which has been backed by the U.S. Treasury, is considering selling off more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it has been owed.
AIG is prepared to move forward with the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and its retirement plan in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG board met Sunday night to review potential sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG could potentially divest include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, its real estate assets and its private equity investments, FT said.
No final decision has been taken on these sales, FT continues.
AIG must sell quickly to pay back the $85 billion loan the Federal Reserve gave it, even at the risk of the American government getting 80% of its capital and losing the current shareholders by the same amount.
Analysis of the historic Paris meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue the banks, a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Dow the day after 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The strongest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The final figures show that the Nasdag index, mainly technical, fell by 199.61 points to 1 983.73 and the widely used Standard & Poors 500 index fell by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks, which was supposed to restore some stability to the markets, Wall Street, which had already been in a slump at the beginning of the quarter, collapsed.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the House of Representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
∀This is a bad image being circulated, showing Congress as incapable of adopting a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', she added, 'and fears that a project adopted in several days'will be too late'.
'If the project is indeed doomed (...), it will soon be up to the Fed and other central banks to get a grip on the crisis, which would further restrict lending conditions,' warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, and made the sense of urgency even more acute, that every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial enterprise in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the US authorities planned to buy the banking business of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated abruptly, leading to emergency measures for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing 'not just an American crisis but a global one', added the FTN Financial analyst.
The market for basic necessities has grown strongly.
The revenue of the Treasury in ten years has fallen from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827% and the revenue in 30 years has fallen from 4.161% to 4.357% last night.
Obama, winner by points in the first televised duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to see who emerged the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QG's for the election announced both the Republicans and the Democrats as their own victors in this televised duel, which was to be watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, while quite respectable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to halt his poll decline five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released a poll on Saturday that puts Obama ahead by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly the better candidate.
Among the undecided voters, the ones who matter now, Obama emerged victorious with 39% of the polls, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the strong performance expected of his rival Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts", warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain never ceased to bring to the fore his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, clearly emphasizing the naïveté of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first televised duel.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
'I don't think that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be president,' he added.
A point of attack that's been preached in the Republican campaign trail since yesterday.
Obama himself said that he represented the future.
He was brief and precise, not letting himself be misunderstood.
He brought to the fore his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
McCain still hasn't understood, Obama has,' opposed a Democratic campaign ad this weekend that accused the Republican of not grasping the full extent of the crisis that is plaguing the 'American on the street.'
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama said yesterday to 20,000 people who had gathered in North Carolina in the pouring rain for a campaign rally.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'working class'. ' The financial crisis gives a clear advantage to Obama, whom the American people consider the most capable of rescuing the economy even from the edge of the abyss.
'The coming week could be a crucial turning point', said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is the final judgment of eight years of bad economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After reiterating that he would probably even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were top priorities for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates deliberately dodged questions about the $700 billion bailout plan that was passed by Congress last night and is deeply unpopular with the public.
∀Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and opposition figures demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on the market square in Minsk on Sunday evening after the polls had closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: "The dictator must step down".
Some admit that they didn't vote in the first place. 'What's the point if they can do whatever they want with my vote,' says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has presented itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic transition.
The sanctions, including the denial of visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and the seizure of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were judged clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting", said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of 12 parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television time, regional meetings and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of meddling in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we don't reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, will not recognize the election as valid.
It stresses that the turnout figures seem too high and that the expansion of advance voting (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
Have you noticed that there has been an election?' asks Social Democrats leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members of Parliament, those who are most in line with the Government's ideas.
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Discourse - Of the blood that was safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be pleased that Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And most importantly, it has restored the public's trust, which had been shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood banks administered by the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HIV virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In view of this tragedy and the public outcry, in February 1994 the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to develop policies to prevent a recurrence of such a disaster.
While Justice Krever was still reluctant to hand in his report, several provinces formed a committee to develop a new system for managing blood banks in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this commission.
According to Gélineau and Krever's reports, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
∀In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its work, just 38% of people had confidence in the Quebec blood conservation system, Dr Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood products and the work in this area over the following years, we have regained the public's trust,' she says, before proudly noting that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary is aware that 'trust is extremely fragile'.
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been operating on the principle of prudence.
At that time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine mania in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation in 1998.
And we had no idea whether this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We have therefore referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which states that exclusionary measures are taken if this is not known and if a disease is slow to progress, as is apparently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself in a degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proved beyond all doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
So this incident has shown us that the precautionary principle we have applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the nucleic acid test (NST), which makes it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor's blood, and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used previously.
The NSTs have made it possible to shorten the incubation period, which takes place between the time the person is infected and the first viruses detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
This has greatly reduced the risk that certain donors may be infected without knowing it and not being able to detect it.
These improvements have made it possible to reduce considerably the risk of transmitting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
In other words, you would have to give out 12 million units of blood before you could infect someone with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV was transmitted through a blood can.
I think that nowadays, it is possible to feel comfortable with receiving or prescribing blood transfusions to restore health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
∀Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen might be able to get into the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects through blood, appeared on the island of Réunion.
We must be constantly monitoring,' Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide a safe supply of healthcare, but also a sufficient supply.
∀Demand is increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer-fighting treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donation network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood.
It is open to any healthy person 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria to donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of donors are rejected because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is common are barred from donating blood for one year.
∀With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get old and can't donate blood anymore.
It's hard to get people to give blood, but it's hard to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that it is rare to find the time to spend an hour donating blood,' laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, used almost exclusively for serious burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being interim stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago we celebrated the stocking of our thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,' continues Dr Décary, who describes this programme of cord blood draw ing as very popular.
ˇ Many mothers feel they have no access to it because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to offer this complex and costly programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact won 3-1 (4-3 with all goals) against the Sounders of Seattle in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, which included the total goal ratio, qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination games of the first league of the USL.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half without goals for either side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goal for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that in the first game of the home-and-home series on Friday, Impact took a 2-1 loss to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, Impact will take on the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night, the Thunder were able to make up for a 3-1 deficit with a 4-3 victory in the Minnesota replay, but the Whitecaps still entered the semifinal round with an overall score of 5 to 4.
Impact will likely face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be decided today.
In short - Victory Gate by Kovalev
The Canadian team's number one trio is ready to kick off the season.
Last night, the unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn, led the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm of fire, resulting in a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two shots and Kovalev converted a pass in this victory, the fourth of the Tricolores in six preliminary matches.
Kovalev scored the only goal of the match.
"I'm not ready", the Russian warned.
I need one more game to feel good about myself.'
'He was too fixated on it in the first half,' said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a thunderous applause.'
Charest is heading north .
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of calling elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party's general assembly was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (L), is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following areas:
During his talk, a kind of image mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, Quebec viewed in Google Maps, maps, and so on.
A lot of money, like during the election campaign.
The Prime Minister refused to rule out the possibility of holding the elections this autumn, even though he had said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' the Prime Minister is said to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' which envisages an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but gave no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to accept them.
The North, according to Mr Charest's list, has nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This area is twice the size of France. It's close to us, it's in Quebec.
It is not just near us, it is in us', he said, as if to make it clear that he was trying to realise a national entrepreneurial dream.
He also stressed that the link between the North and the South was the key to Quebec's growth: the road to gold in Abitibi, the techne Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after taking a dramatic pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister told the press.
∀This is a traditional stance followed by all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, and if the opportunity arises I will take that position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
In addition, 'with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the north', he said, and spoke of the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable all year because of the melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister feels it is a duty to occupy this territory.
What about the people of the area, the Aborigines and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (formerly a Peking MP from Ungava) have already started discussions with some thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) played an important part, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will, moreover, be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Commissioner said that the plan would be "discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly".
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of that of the liberal prime ministers who had preceded him.
Like the Liberals who came before us, we have re-imagined ourselves to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's taking over the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming of the Beauharnois power station into the Adélard-Godbout dam.
From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the quiet revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has always known how to shape the future', explained Jean Charest.
He referred to another, conservative project, the 'Roads to the North' programme of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that it was planned to be commissioned in 2012.
'This is between us, but I intend to be part of it,' he confided to his party members, which caused applause at the event.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which he is legally able to do.
He stressed that his calendar was full, however, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend's general assembly provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially 'constitutional goals', which were accepted without further ado: the PLQ demands in particular the recognition of the 'special character of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council and to have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition has reacted to the guidelines of the Nord Plan with scepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it refused to apply them.
If she had done so, we would be much further along today', said Ms Marois, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has spoken out in favour of supporting the government's adoption of a Plan Nord.
'But what we want is for this to be more than a big show,' said party leader Sébastien Proulx on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A Land Dishonored
Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (ironically) in the Harper government, was the one who last summer took the liberty of saying that Louise Arbour was a disgrace to Canada.
This woman, who has waged an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, to be shamed like this says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as it does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing with a government which is the only one of the countries concerned not to have taken home its compatriot held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even consider that Omar Khadr was a juvenile when the things that are being accused of happening to him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to languish in inhuman conditions.
The only one who stoops to a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are the ones who are advocating for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: It cares little that a young adult will surely be forever broken after so many years of torment.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our democracy, that word that Harper constantly carries around like a flag and that sounds so meaningless coming out of his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is permissible to mistreat, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen at will, at the whim of a head of government who is supported by a minority (even if he is a minority after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they fail to see that this government has renounced what once constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this lotus, and nowhere else.
Free thought - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold.
The report confirms, in an Orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold mining company was seeking to bring a libel action against three authors and a small publishing house with no money, seeking to open a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, then they are not judging the truth, especially not in the case of libel cases, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to bankrupt anyone who dares to hold an opinion that goes against theirs.
No matter how the trial goes, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and to fight with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold miners.
The tactic in these unequal battles is often to ruin the defenders in order to force a compromise that will silence the other side and also discourage anyone from taking up the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her views to the public.
Unlike what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, debates are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas rather than by baton-whipping.
So it would have been enough if the gold mines had released their books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent review teams that could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and is sweeping aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a wave of the hand.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and yet disregard the opinions of that very public?
It seems that in the vice-president's world, that word only covers the lavishly paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a pretty narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada do so primarily because they oppose the brutal attitude of the gold miners.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag lawsuit (during the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just issued a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, asking them to stop using this term...).
Apart from the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the Barrick Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic inquiry and the search for truth that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and debate issues that are not to the liking of the rich corporations of the world, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could have led it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The academic environment to which we belong has long been known to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
The loss of the university is a loss to the university community, as well as to public debate, and it's time for governments to take action to curb this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and senior members of Congress, Republican and Democrat alike, finally agreed yesterday to the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to halt the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be passed by both houses of Congress.
The main contents are: better control by Members of Parliament over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to guarantee the repayment of public funds used, new provisions to curb the number of houses foreclosed due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior staff of the companies supported.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market effective,' said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street stock market crash", she said.
"This is the basic point: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the turmoil in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous", said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, fearing the effect that a new failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were late in the negotiations, were more in favour of the agreement, but did not hesitate to express their displeasure that it had to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding certain provisions to the settlement, especially those that would allow homeowners to keep their homes and those that would affect the salaries of executives at companies bailed out by the state.
The Commission is also proposing that the European Parliament should be consulted on the future of the Community's financial system.
But these measures are necessary,' he said on American television.
Asked on another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: ∀I'd like to know the details first, but I hope so.
The guiding principles that I have read [suggest] that this is something that we all have to digest, and we will be able to move forward with it.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed to use taxpayers' money to
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, which led first to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other forms of more commonly held bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freeze in financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican congressmen who last week thwarted the first attempt at unification.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain toxic assets of distressed companies should only be secured by the government and not bought, it seems that they have escaped the dead end.
To make it easier for everyone in Congress to see the bigger picture, they also added a provision that says that if the government were to lose money on this program in five years, they could then levy new taxes to recoup their invested capital.
The new plan calls for an initial payment of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion has to be approved by a new vote of Congress.
In return for his help, Washington gets shares in the companies he helps, which will pay him dividends in the event of profits, and which he can sell back when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will be able to suspend attachment proceedings in respect of the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and to fix the repayment deadlines and the severance payments to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and the Senate to vote on it on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it's not certain that their plan will be approved.
In fact, yesterday, more votes were raised against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
"It's very clear that Washington doesn't understand us", Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House finance committee, told his constituents.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is asking the taxpayers to come to the cash.'
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called the "Skeptics' Caucus", presents the matter differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say, 'We ask Congress not to be pressured and to consider carefully what course to take,'" he said yesterday.
At the same time, we have seen in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in serious difficulties, since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis from the high-risk mortgages in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
'This is not money lost', Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are looming.'
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank that had been crippled by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over $41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the UK Government has had to nationalise since the start of this financial crisis, after Northern Rock.
Newman (19252008) - Paul Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor with the charming smile free himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and obvious talent have probably kept him from a position of power that would give birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great perseverator!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the golden age of American cinema.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and to whom he had long been a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly more fragile, but just as much an apostle of freedom and of the breaking of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the son of a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian descent.
From its European roots, it was to emerge as one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality feature.
Because he was a reflection of an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the combat wounded man in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early '50s and then attended the Actors Studio in New York before making his way into theater, television and soon, movies.
This same civil rights activist was the runner-up in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and a sex symbol, despite having been in a romantic relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, dedicated and over-sensitive to the glamour of show business star, whose mystery will never be fully solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has left movie lovers in a state of shock this weekend, as all his great roles were played out on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American filmmaking in constant flux is passing with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, made into a film by Tennessee Williams in 1958, come to mind.
It evokes a much shorter memory (1990) that is of his sensitive Mr Bridge, who in his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
There have been so many Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role originally intended for James Dean, was re-introduced after his death and made Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic thug in the outstanding The Sting, which won the 1973 Oscar for Best Picture.
As the bitter and vindictive billiards player in Robert Rossen 's wonderful The Hustler (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
It's still him.
His life story is a blend of eras.
Young people know him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
A final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes closed the circle.
Unlike many movie legends who retired early enough from the world of cinema, Newman was to remain in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his glitz and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive performances.
The job wasn't always easy for the handsome Paul Newman, who had been getting the parts for a long time.
But he rarely played the outsider's Sunnyboys: neurotics, alcoholics, villains or desperates, whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slipping and his rebelliousness.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of both sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of tributes that Newman received yesterday, his close friend and former partner in crime Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared, "His presence has improved my life and this country".
Generosity and joy of life were essential qualities of the late actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the Hollywood drift, is now gone.
We have probably seen it many times with its foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was thought to be quite tasteless, although we found it amusing at first.
The profits from his sales went to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the point of firing.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these words: "Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It's been an honor to be here.
And we were honored to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoicing factory of Zuschlag & Co.?
On October 8th, the trial of János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The defendants are accused in particular of involvement in organised crime, as well as gross negligence, damage and fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, the proceeds from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often documented with fake invoices.
The State funds and grants from the local government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have been channelled partly into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation and partly into the private coffers of individuals.
The investigation authorities announced that fictitious invoices had been presented when the tendering money was withdrawn and that the associations had not fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were faked.
The blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the circular seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on the round trip north of Lake Plateau, to which István Lados was sent by János Zázár.
During this "exploration tour", Lados was to search for guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption, so that later on he could issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Budapest Municipality on the basis of these forms.
The majority of these calculations were allegedly manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the preparation of the corresponding reports.
One of the targets of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer hall.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering establishment hosted the 90-strong group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
Now, however, the head of the factory says that such a large group would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at one time.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors of form and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at a time, is said to have been used by 130 guests.
The imagination of the accounting forgers was also apparently unlimited when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting records the documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As the managing director Győző Farkas told hvg.hu, he immediately knew that the documents were forged when he was presented with them by the prosecutor's office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly stamped on the stamp".
Furthermore, apart from the formal errors, the fact that the establishment was supposed to have accommodated 100 persons was also incorrect, since it has a total of 11 rooms which cannot possibly accommodate that many persons.
The bill also listed food and drink, but the restaurant had been out of business for a while.
The eager counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offered travel abroad, and so they indicated Hungary travel on the cash invoice, which also contradicted the company's invoicing practices.
The investigation revealed that they also invoiced VAT, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company only charged 15%, instead of 25%, and the employees issued invoices only by machine, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another error made by the accountants was that they had indicated in a case of "transport of goods" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor said.
Further formal errors - incorrect invoice format, incorrect stamp - were the reason why the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as forgeries.
The same was true of Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó Sport Camp, whose managers claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another 'mistake' was made by the forgers at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in the process of being dissolved at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have dined there - the mass manager therefore stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Forged deliberately
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they would have to put fictitious invoices.
The Foundation has issued invoices to the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, for an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Ltd. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also alleged to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co. In 2003, the GmbH is alleged to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, and the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with fake invoices for a total value of HUF 5 million, relating to unpaid services.
However, there was also little payment as the invoices were cancelled immediately after they were issued, something which the persons concerned failed to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the messenger of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest but not to be found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the period from October to December 2005 for a total value of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to having issued invoices in the name of the company to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to the Harmadik Évezred Alaértpítvány and to having collected the equivalent of them himself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos Investment Bt. were allegedly founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
In reality, none of these companies were active, which the defendant said was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the procurement, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is alleged to have issued 15 invoices to the organisations, with a total value of HUF 14,2 million, on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecution believes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice and 10% of the VAT.
Kubatov even allegedly abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért companies submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500 000 forints each, but misappropriated these amounts.
In order to cover up this, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works Team Kft.
These accounts were, incidentally, secured during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations now include a number of defendants who are expected to confess to the fraudulent accounting procedures as they have already been presented to the public prosecutor.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to make a full confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he has already promised on several occasions to report fully on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have made a pact with him to compensate the bulk of the HUF 50 million in damage incurred, and whether Zuschlag is prepared to accept responsibility in return.
It is possible that Zuschlag is now playing the "defendant" after his pleas for relief of imprisonment and house arrest were ignored.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage through economic crime and have not repaid it are at large, or at least under house arrest, Zuschlag is denied this opportunity.
The Psychology of Over-selling - or Why We Are Willing to Pay More
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in uncovering the neuroeconomic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in Science magazine, people are willing to pay exorbitant prices to avoid being beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay.
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological pattern of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was asked to play the lottery while the other participated in a game - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants won money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the overbid of the opponent plays a significant role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" function of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally conducted studies on the tracking of money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, and then they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward if they emerged victorious from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a losing game.
The difference between the two groups was that the emphasis was on winning, while the other group was on losing.
But as evidence of the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to bet more than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
The behaviour observed in auctions has so far been justified by the pleasure of winning or the avoidance of risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved by the use of imaging neuroscience, and we now have a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When to See a Doctor
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is listed as the leading cause of death in Hungary.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 are being treated, because patients often don't know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two ways, depending on the pathogen: in hepatitis A and E, they can be transmitted through the digestive tract (e.g., through contaminated food or water); in hepatitis B, C, and D, viruses can be transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids (such as semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva).
Vaccination against A and B viruses is recommended for travellers, but there is no vaccine against C virus.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after the contaminated food is eaten and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, stool becomes light, urine dark, and recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-related diseases, as well as more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people are on medication.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most people who are infected do not even know they have the disease because the pathogen is killing the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20 or 30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
Three groups are more likely to have the disease: those who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of people with chronic hepatitis C worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is detectable by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult a family doctor at the first sign of an unknown origin.
If caught in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first observed by patient organisations worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the campaign is to raise awareness of this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research has shown that religious faith acts as a kind of "pain-killer" that has been said to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment to determine how belief in God affects a person's perception of pain, reports the British newspaper Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre experiment, 12 believers and 12 atheists were each given electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
The results showed that the faithful were able to eliminate much of the pain.
In fact, by means of brain-scan technology, it was demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
The study was the first in a research project involving not only scientists but also philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
In the experiment, a flashing device was attached to the left hand of the subject, which gave the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus their attention on two paintings: one of the Virgin Mary, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other of Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermillion".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would induce a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's picture because it was hardly different from the other painting and was considered soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electrical shocks in four stages, while they were asked to look at either the religious painting or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for", and they felt "calm and peaceful".
When they looked at the religious painting, they reported over 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could be produced by other powerful images in the atheists, just by finding the right one.
"We would have to find an image that would evoke very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
"The practice of faith should change our personalities, and in many cases does", Wright says.
After these excellent results, the question remains, what effect would a Madonna painting by Leonardo or another similar painter have on the pain regulation of the faithful?
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You Are What You Say You Are
On its tenth birthday, Google can rightfully claim that it's in people's pockets as much as it is above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which doctors they go to, and what motivates them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the chief executives of Google.
To skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horrors, he warns: they are missing the very essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, moving closer to the company's original goal of "organizing all the information in the world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still in the early stages of gathering information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google could answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job is really for me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet searches would record the search terms, the IP addresses used to search and the pages visited.
For example, the 'personalized search' introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and access it later, so that hits can be generated much more accurately later, and the same logic underlies the so-called 'recommendations', which the system uses to recommend tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in case of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is the potential power represented by the company that is feared, rather than the guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or the rebellion against power that is rejected by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties when necessary, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A recent example of this was the recent action taken against pedophilia in Brazil, where Google gave the Brazilian government information collected from the community site called "Orkut" that also allowed for the identification of pedophilia.
However, users concerned about their privacy rights were still able to breathe a sigh of relief in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully sued the FBI: according to this, Google can no longer be forced by any constitutional provision to provide information to the FBI on secret request.
(Although the German government has successfully obtained the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, it has been deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, retroactively for two months.)
Google's image remains controversial: Those who are reluctant to give their personal data out because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google services are lashing out at the company with the indignation that is due to the companies that portray themselves as conservative.
However, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries and brings together enthusiastic computer enthusiasts, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which thanks to Windows is the market leader, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require identification codes from its users and provides its services free of charge, so that an open source, constantly updated code and software package appear to be far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, geeks have a keen eye for the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has come to the forefront in recent years, especially thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, meaning that users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and although the dimensions vary individually, the main thing remains the same: to show up in public.
The average teenager can manage their profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, they can link it to other services like Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and they can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and they can also keep blogs that automatically show the latest photo galleries uploaded to Flickr or Picasa.
And a series of other examples prove that when looking at the party photos from the previous night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend had fun with, or the employee is fired for expressing his anger at the company's management in his blog with too much honesty - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has been completely reinterpreted.
The online life is what you give away - that's the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who's trying to keep something secret, or even bypass Google's monopoly, can do that with ease -- like with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine but deliberately leaves no trace.
Many people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can handle alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
Meanwhile, the public is waiting for Google to reveal its true face.
At $156 billion, it is even ahead of IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) and Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense ad space is threatening advertising revenue, and the rapidly expanding services are a headache for Microsoft and other software developers.
Critical observers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: for example, the management of the company completely rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management thought that the multiple meals of the employees were too costly. All this, however, is quite mild in contrast to the fact that Google even went to its knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement according to which all regime-critical hits, or those that violated good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal policy of the company is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is available. Nevertheless, events in the coming months and years could turn things around: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is now taking on such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the next generation of sci-fi writers with the stuff -- for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow, describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a human being becomes terribly intimate thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd to eliminate his tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now questioned two young people who are suspected of having helped to clear the tracks, the spokesman of the police commissioner, Borsod, said on Tuesday.
The youths have confessed, and are now being charged with aiding and abetting.
According to information from the MTI news agency, the two girls are in free defence.
The Commission has already adopted a proposal to amend the directive on the protection of the environment in the event of a natural disaster.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having murdered several people out of greed.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger sum of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor to a property in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man had planned the crime from a long time ago - this is also proved by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police are now working with experts to investigate the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange is offering to buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered some 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the full purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange's shares.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that they had previously been excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is fully state-owned.
The Polish State owns 99% of the shares, but intends to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily E15, the Polish bid represents the highest bid ever made for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The newspaper reports that so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have all made bids.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the bidders, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that in the future this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
Shareholders' agreements allow for the sale of 90% of the shares.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 per cent share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 per cent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis as seen by European newspapers
In their commentary on the worsening international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday already spoke of a "second 9/11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president, La Repubblica reported, who was unable to even get his own party to back up a bill that would have eased the alarming situation...
Rather than a "new Pearl Harbor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Some of the press in Madrid are tracking the scapegoat to Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is the reason why the world economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatened with collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
The Bush plan was not perfect, but now, after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, and at the very moment when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat is now a fact of life, says the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives to help the developing countries to meet their obligations.
But if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to step over the edge and centralise control of money markets.
The Commission has also taken the lead in the fight against fraud, and has been a key player in the fight against fraud, particularly in the area of taxation, where it has been able to increase its powers and influence.
The EU has not yet seriously tackled the crisis which is sweeping across the old continents like a tsunami.
The "saviours" may not have to "run" with several hundred billion euros immediately, but it would be wise to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money to avert even greater damage.
A Smart Car That Imitates the Flight of a Bumblebee
What better way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents than to imitate the obstacle sensors in nature?
Take the bees, for example.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was unveiled, where the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in creating new crash-avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C car-robot-driven biomimetic system, a mini-car with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collision.
"In flight, each bee forms its own oval 'private space' that is very similar to our own 'protective shield,'" said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The bee's compound eye, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays a vital role in this.
To mimic the function of the compound eye, researchers took up the idea of the laser-guided distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a 180° field of vision of 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the on-board microprocessor which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is detected in a fraction of a second, and the Autobot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tires at the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it wasn't, the Autobot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Autobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process has to mirror the behavior of the bees when they're avoiding other bees.
And it has to happen in a split second.
However, unlike the bees, the evasion cannot be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the tires' flexibility.
While the bees here have an infinite number of ways to evade other bees, the researchers were able to use only rotational motion, or acceleration and deceleration, in the Autobot.
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries which are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it is more about the instinctive, intelligent response, and less about the processing of the data, and even less about the ability to store it.
This device only has to process and respond to a few inputs per second.
It doesn't need to store it, or produce an intuitive, logical response from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a handful of kilobytes of memory on the fly.
It doesn't need gigabytes and megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in series production within the next ten years.
Another application of the technology could be in GPS satellite navigation, where the driver is deliberately guided around obstacles to reach the destination.
A name for the precious child
Now we have the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying up the banks' bad loans.
In the first round, half the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended Saturday after midnight Eastern time, congressmen rushed through a deal on the $700 billion bailout after days of debate, Reuters reported.
The Commission is also proposing that the European Parliament and the Council should be given the opportunity to discuss the issue of the European Parliament's role in the European Union.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the health of workers from the risks arising from exposure to asbestos is a step in the right direction, and the Commission is therefore proposing to amend the directive to include asbestos in the list of substances and mixtures.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. 8 p.m. Washington time on Sunday (Central European time on Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-flying on the stock exchanges.
First, on Monday, the House of Representatives votes on the 2008 economic stabilization bill, then it's the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
But the program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the $700 billion should be spent all at once on buying bad, debt-laden securities.
The first tranche will be a maximum of half of the $700 billion, with $250 billion available immediately after Congress votes on the bill on Monday, and will be used to buy debt-laden, bad-loans securities, with the remaining $100 billion to be decided by the president.
The program is reviewed by a separate committee, which also includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgage-impaired securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the Ministry's officials, the purchase can be made either through an auction or directly.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program, where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulsen said: The Act defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as immediate relief to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a major financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it is signed, Paulson said.
The heads of the banks which are in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can, however, count on their payments, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang, being cut by the government.
There will be a reduction in salaries only in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each case.
The cut basically means that when the Ministry buys at auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the retired bank president is pushed into retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the executive salaries are not overstated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements to allow more people to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that cuts in executive pay are regulated by law", said Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commenting on the measure.
The State gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, since they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank recovers.
The bill calls for the president to submit to Congress within the next five years a proposal on how taxpayers can get back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
That's not what the American people expect from us, the plan doesn't protect taxpayers' money at all, says California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were pushed by the same people who were responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
According to the Central Statistics Office, domestic sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.

The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, while for shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove up prices for chemicals and manufacturing considerably (1.6%).
Prices fell in crude oil processing (1.4%), electrical and technical equipment (0.9%) and, to a lesser extent, wood processing (0.1%).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of manufacturing industry, price increases were measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the main domestic industrial markets, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of the gas price increase introduced on 1 July.
Looking at domestic sales markets of manufacturing industry year on year, prices in crude oil processing increased the most (32.4 per cent).
The metal processing sector saw a 13.2 percent increase, while the increase in food, beverage, and tobacco production was 11 percent.
Prices fell in the textile industry (2.5%) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3%).
The rate of inflation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1%.
Overall, manufacturing prices rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared with the previous year.
In the domestic market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the capital goods sector (0.7%).
Prices in the consumer goods production sectors rose by 0.3%, while they remained the same in the energy and refining sectors compared with the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 compared to the 2007 period was observed in the energy and recycling sector (16.8%).
In the consumer goods sector, prices rose by 6.8%, while in the capital goods sector prices fell by 1.4%.
Export prices of manufactured goods measured in forint rose by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month, but fell by 3.9% year on year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7% against the euro and by 7.1% against the dollar, and compared with the August 2007 rate, it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
No more visas to the US from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the US-Hungary visa agreement will come into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
She said that "the only thing that now depends on the timely introduction of the electronic immigration and control system overseas".
The Commission has also proposed that the new system should be applied to all tourist arrivals, but that the new system should not include entry permits.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington today.
She will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the "Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American political parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout for banks on Sunday.
Congress and government officials announced Sunday morning after days of marathon deliberations that they have reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the thaw of the frozen credit market became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent polls show Obama's lead has continued to grow thanks to economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has simultaneously melted.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages of consumer protection which he had supported.
"We must act now, and act responsibly ... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's vision of the economy "obsolete".
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We're all going to have a hard time with this . . . but certainly not doing anything is not an alternative".
The Republican senator said the plan also calls for the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of clearances for top managers - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had played no definite role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press release of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp have become more self-confident - this is how Der Spiegel comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are prepared to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution annihilates its fathers".
In the opinion of the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christsozialen have been renewing Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epochal break is at the same time a problem for Christian Democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The CSU's disaster did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, something that had already been evident for almost exactly ten years: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party.
Because ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU dropped to 47.7%, falling below the 50% mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization which the CSU has consistently pursued in the Federal Republic has in the end destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but the pace of the process was considerably overestimated, but secularization, the success of education, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain untouched by the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with more options, and that has political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp have become more critical and opinionated.
It is striking that in recent weeks the most distant views of the CSU have been expressed by the traditional groups of citizens: the professions, the industrial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma or university degree.
Here, CSU support has dropped to just under 40%.
The press (diepresse.com) is a major source of information on the European Union.
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in its article "Who with whom? Party leaders reluctant to join coalition" on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The PPP shall not allow the SPÖ to interfere in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens are not yet ready to make a decision on a coalition.
The new elections are over and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely let their cards in.
The SPÖ leader Werner Faymann reiterated his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some of the Länder and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's fisheries resources are not used to the detriment of other countries.
A repetition of this course would not be out of the question.
Molterer, on the other hand, has been cautious about red offers.
He said that cooperation could not be fruitful if Faymann tried to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
The question of whether his party would go into opposition or into coalition was open at the moment and these issues should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BÖZ boss Jörg Haider showed himself openly in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibility", said Haider.
Járóka: The cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, hosted by the French Presidency of the Council of the EU, began in Paris.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP, drew particular attention to educational segregation as one of the most serious violations of rights that Roma children suffer, and the biggest obstacle to their need for recognition.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, and the most important European organisations for equal opportunities and civil society.
According to the press office of Fidesz MEPs, Járóka pointed out that apart from discrimination in job-search, the Roma are being excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education and, thanks to poor basic education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right which would play a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could strengthen the economies of EU Member States.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment from the risks arising from the use of chemicals.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and turnover tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped", said Lívia Járóka.
The MEPs also stressed that the EU should take a concerted, targeted and action-oriented approach to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector, including the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens", Járóka said.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for promoting the goals of equal opportunities and freedom from discrimination at European, but also national, level, in the spirit of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities'.
CSU: Mercy for time
At the end of October , the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided .
Despite the electoral debacle, no heads are still rolling for the time being, the staff debates have been postponed at the head of the Bavarian CSU.
The party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein will remain in office, the only question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The much-sculpted duo, however, already made it clear that it did not want to stick to their armchairs.
The aim is to appease the angry faction and the party base, who, one day after the 'Bavaria tsunami', have called for personal consequences in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the peak of his career, the Christian Social Union had 60.7 per cent of the vote, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only 43.4 per cent.
The CSU has been the "solo ruler" for 46 years in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives will remain the dominant force in the southern part of the state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in future.
As a first sign of the internal restructuring of the party, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, will also be included in the exploratory team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voters" respectively, about a possible Munich coalition.
It is ironic that the list of "Free Voters" brings into the legislature the same Gabriele Pauli whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, only to then mercilessly dismiss the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all their efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
The EU's new Commissioner for Enlargement, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, has said that the EU's new position on the EU's future is not based on the EU's position on the EU's future.
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his view, the CSU deserved much more support from its sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which contributed to the success of the 2005 elections at the national level, is not put back on its feet with a joint effort, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor again after the September 2009 elections.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the loss of ground of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
The Commission is not prepared to accept the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946 to date.
The opposition to Lukashenko: 110-0
No opposition MP has entered the Ukrainian parliament in Sunday's elections.
Russian observers believe this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislature of the country of 10 million people has been without opposition for decades, but the opposition United Democratic Forces (ODS) party had hoped that Lukashenko, who won a fourth term in office in 2006 after an unfair election, would "leave" some opposition lawmakers in parliament.
That is why the ODS even distanced itself from the boycotts that were planned.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia due to rising natural gas import prices. Loans have even been taken to mitigate price rises, and the country has also agreed to sell Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline that runs through the country, to the Russians.
A temporary relief was provided by the OECD's evaluation of the elections, which focused on the positive developments rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report on Monday already criticised the campaign - according to which opposition figures are not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of votes.
Despite this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even prepared for minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to refuse to recognize the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered both territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started", Alexander Milinkevich told our magazine.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to let even an oppositionist into parliament".
The opposition is not planning any protest actions in the face of the results, but is rather trying to make the need for economic reform clear to the voters.
"We are facing many problems here - opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, local authorities are blocking our distribution, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the elderly", said Milinkevich, pointing out that even the most supported layer of pensioners does not agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the creation of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security' that resembles the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble", says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe in deeds, not words".
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the officers' entrances and exits.
The measure will apply from today to those who stamp their eggs and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new 'Anti-Follow-up Law' was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
"Folding doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher attendance and more services", said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of accountability and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism", Brunetta emphasises once again.
The Palazzo Chigi marks the end of the use of the Palazzo Chigi in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says that "the choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
So , all in all , there 's no more breakfast during working hours , no more coffee or croissant .
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Superior Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Health in Rome announced that "within three months, the absence rate of civil servants has been reduced to 50%, which means that 60,000 more people are present at work each year".
He added that it was necessary to improve the efficiency of the public administration in Italy.
"their wage dynamics, the Minister said, have been twice as high as the private sector over the last 8-10 years and far above the rate of inflation".
Thousands of civil servants have now joined forces to oppose the Brunetta Decree in the Codacons-supported appeal.
"While the Minister for Public Service is showing off figures on fewer absences from work", says the Consumer Centre, "the number of 'active lazybones' is continually increasing.
Indeed, thousands of correct and worthy public servants have joined together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree".
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is being challenged for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, as is the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy there are 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 are disabled for life.
For 2007, the data of the INAIL (National Institute for Labour Information) confirm that the number of fatal accidents at work was around 1200.
These figures illustrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be celebrating the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this tragic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of the past few days confirm the crucial importance of prevention at work", affirms the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro), Pietro Mercandelli.
The President of the Republic expresses his 'great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to the assistance to the families of the victims and to the awareness of public opinion'.
"A certain indignation has arisen, understandably in the case of tragedies which, by their magnitude, generate a certain amount of media and public concern, but in everyday life we are often confronted with dramatic events which, in their own dynamic, can even repeat themselves".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: there is a crucial need to invest in education and information".
The numerous initiatives to raise awareness in schools by young people who are entering the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social gravity.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that "the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards definitive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of workrelated deaths is much too high", stresses Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention, which is what causes the tragedy in the end".
"We believe that there is little that can be done to combat the phenomenon of accidents.
We believe that more controls and inspections are necessary, says Mercandelli, but also more measures to educate workers, starting from school".
'Further efforts are needed in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is needed in the face of a phenomenon which constitutes a social emergency".
Mr Mercandelli also spoke of the "progressive deterioration of the protection for the victims of industrial accidents" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employee a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an industrial accident does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations decided from time to time by a legislator".
MP3 players under indictment: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a long period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can cause permanent hearing damage.
The European Commission, in a report published today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the European Union's Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks.
"The report  states in a footnote  that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music for more than an hour a week for at least five years with portable music devices risk permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who routinely turn portable music devices and cell phones to a high volume are unknowingly damaging their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings, "the EU says, "show a clear risk that calls for urgent action.
What really matters is to educate the consumer and make this information public.
In the light of this scientific knowledge, we must re-examine existing control systems to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology.'
The independent scientific committee was appointed by Brussels in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
'The scientists confirm that their concern is justified and that the European Commission, together with the other Member States and those concerned, will now examine the measures needed to protect children and young people better from the noise emitted by portable musical instruments and similar devices.'
The Commission has already adopted a European standard limiting the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB.
The damage can be greatly reduced by using solutions such as reducing the volume and the duration of the exposure.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical equipment listen to music for only five hours a week at a loud volume (above 89 decibels), then the legal limits for maximum noise levels at work have already been exceeded.
Those who go beyond this limit risk losing their hearing completely within five years.
This would amount to 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the go-ahead to the 'Commission for the Future of the Capital'
We start today, we're supposed to be done by March, we're supposed to be done by June.
This is the procedure established by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will be drawing up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June, with the 'official stamp' of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", stresses Alemanno. "It will put forward proposals for a development plan for Rome, for which the political responsibility will remain with the City Council and the Municipality.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March its task will be completed and the Commission will dissolve again, since such a project must have an endpoint in time.
In June, the Lord Mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan, in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
The Commission's powers are called into question because their opinion is not binding, but Mr Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If it produces quality results, as the Attali Commission in France did, and this will certainly be the case in Rome, then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look at a longer period of time, so that we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a more profound perspective".
The Mayor of Rome is very careful to clarify that 'this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will cost the citizens of Rome not a penny and it will make us think.
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus take a joint step into the future".
A future, said the Mayor of Rome, which 'will not be confined to the present municipal boundaries but will look much further,' not only in terms of Rome's role as a metropolis and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.'
Obama  the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician who is very keen to be seen as independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and who cultivated relations with the hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private individual)".
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more intense, especially now that the election is approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he's going to get the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators!"
But these attacks don't really mean much; they are racist attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win by a big margin.
Again, there are people who speak with their heart and not with their head.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: 'Only in the voting booth will we know for whom the true American patriot will cast his vote.'
This is a reflection of a US mentality that has been hidden until recently.
"Say what you want, and we'll decide who we'll do our croissants for, Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Something that had never been heard before, until now, when the success of the black candidate seemed so certain.
Anyway, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
When 1,500 people were asked what mistakes Bush made during his presidency, 89% said the Iraq war.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority the weak point of Bush.
The person who will take his place will face a huge task.
The financial collapse is also affecting journalists: the newspapers are already showing the cuts, and many blame the Internet for the "killer" of the print media.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express any real concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the authorities.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
The big problems are compounded by the cuts in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the paper together.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we are to prevent the shrinkage of traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public.
A clear but complicated pessimism is now permeating the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives in the print media believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, it is as high as 65% among executives.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to imagine the direction the Web is going.
The main publishing groups are opening their doors to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the print media.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to wanting to join the new technology in the hope that "it will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are confident that their reporters share their values, compared to only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "job security".
The percentage of managers who fear losing their jobs within three years is 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The issue of "safe work" in teams (our "editorial staff", ed.) is always a topical issue in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists are contracted.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer whatever they like and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often receive very high salaries, whereas the editor may sometimes receive only 10,000 euros a month, plus pension and insurance payments.
The problem of holidays is complicated: a certain number of days in the first year, so many after the third, to reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often "fall ill" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
The European Union is the only institution in the world that has the power to impose sanctions on the perpetrators of these crimes.
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of First Instance in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the countercontract in the case of the takeover of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residency in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
The Court of First Instance held that such interpretations (against which the public prosecutor had ruled) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain incriminating evidence against him.
The Elite Is in Danger
The phenomenon was already evident a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion White House austerity package: a large section of the American people was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which reported how the crisis is gradually dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world and especially in the South and the center of the states, is gaining voters.
This section of the party owes its rise to the voice of the man I mentioned above.
But this example is only a small part of the great changes that the present economic earthquake is heralding or even already represents: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps beyond.
In the States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events which, under these new conditions, are finally taking shape and coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means the collapse of banking and financial institutions which have close links with the outside world and at the same time manage a huge amount of the wealth of private households resident in a single State.
This poses an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, who are also a huge constituency.
The crisis thus appears to be global in economic terms, but it is almost purely national in political terms.
Political internationalism seems to have been sidelined and has lost its voice: the clearest proof of this is given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, is unable to find a common path.
The European Parliament has been a great help to the people of Europe, and it has been a great help to the people of the United States, and it has been a great help to the people of Europe.
And besides the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: two conditions which cannot be overridden under certain circumstances, which no other international organization or market will be able to use in a similar way.
The new emphasis on the national-state element is perfectly in keeping with the growing importance attached recently to a closely related sector of the economy: territoriality.
It is paradoxical that, at a time when we have been so convinced that we have entered a networked realm, a realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of the intangible, we must suddenly realise that our future will depend more and more on the essentially material things: water, crops and oil.
These can all be transported from one place to another in the world, but they are nevertheless bound to a narrowly defined piece of land.
So the one who has such territory has an advantage over another who lives in a barren, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second innovation, which, however, requires a short introduction.
If you say territory, if you say government, if you say politics, you also say leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respectable leadership, the need for someone who knows how to run things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of resentment against the existing leadership, especially that of the economy, which has proved to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
The European Community is a great example of a Community which is not only a political but also a political one, and which is not only a political but also a political one.
The way seems to be clear for the conviction of large sections of the population that it is not the actions of the social elite but rather their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is increasingly foreign and outdated to the majority.
The demand for leadership is thus feeding a branched but powerful underground movement of disempowerment of the ruling class and the conventional political establishment, manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of the electorate and the sudden upheaval of the collective mood of recent times, from the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, to the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role).
The impression is given that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their magazines, their intellectual credos, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value in relation to what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West, and is being intensified by the financial crisis and pushed to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply an exaggeration to speak of a "mass rebellion".
But keeping your eyes wide open is not.
The super glue that blows up walls
Defeating the forces of gravity with a little glue and being able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to be almost there.
With a piece of glue spread over an area of only one square inch, researchers have been able to fix a 300-pound body onto a vertical wall.
The study, published in the American Journal of Neuroscience, reports on the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the glue can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged in a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko's feet, which are covered with microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the reptile's foot grip and "can be removed from the wall without any problems", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers are thinking about less fascinating uses, like connecting electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could fall within the realm of space.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
The University of California, Berkeley, is also studying a new species of tapeworm.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, scientists in California present a microfiber adhesive that, like a hair, cleans itself of dust by moving on a surface, thus maintaining a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer for their refreshing qualities and vitamin content, can cause serious damage to health when taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with drug use, and at the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded the alarm that a glass of apple, orange, or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs to the point of virtually eliminating them, thus endangering the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has been suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurological agents, to toxic levels.
MEDICAL REPORTS IN THE COUNTRY  The same drug agency issued a report two years ago warning doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture, stressing that they should be careful about what they drink in conjunction with such drugs as diazepan or methadone.
It's NOT ONLY FRUIT  Experts say that orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually passed on immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are then free to change the consumer information.
It is therefore advisable to read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, to ask a pharmacist or doctor", stresses the Ansa expert.
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policies.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a New York Times editorial that the second event was more decisive for U.S. history than the attacks.
The answer to this prediction, which was the subject of considerable controversy and which was still presented to economists years later, has now proved to be absolutely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the Enron or Worldcom scandals has disappeared from public view", said Krugman in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a trivializing figure with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, the third version of the "anti-Microsoft" package is available
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an ever-growing number of users as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presented to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more spartan start menu, it is now finally compatible with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest standard ISO version.
The Commission also noted the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Some new features are also interesting, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, for example. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
This is also the case for the creation of hybrid PDF files, which extend the typical graphic formats of Adobe by incorporating the elements of a spreadsheet and a word processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most important improvements in the applications: tables can now be edited by several users, thus avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a task to guarantee a better correction process.
Some companies are in the process of publishing various OpenOffice features on the cloud, and the final results are due to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html.
The program is available for the Linux operating system as well as for Windows and Mac OS.
The installation CDs can be sent to your home or office on request.
However, while the free of charge may be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the field of business where OpenOffice could make a big jump: after all, various public administrations and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which is an excellent help for small and medium-sized enterprises and thus even opens up business opportunities.
OpenOffice is made up of five main components: Writer, the word-like word processor; Calc, the spreadsheet program, which aims to supplant Excel; Impress, for creating presentations like Powerpoint; Dbase for running databases in place of the more familiar Access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads - a target which can be easily exceeded with the 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Kohl also tested positive, making him the fourth doping case in the history of the European Union.
A new doping case has been opened in the context of the last Tour de France: it concerns the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who finished third and won the best climber's jersey.
The news was published on the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth rider to test positive for Cera, the third-generation EPO, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and Germany's Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood samples taken from Kohl's body is one of those made in the last few weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chattenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be banned from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive result and also informed the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the best climber's jersey for himself.
The New York Times asks: "Is Italy racist?" "Is it racist to say that you are a racist?"
Italy, "the former country of emigrants, has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", who are only reluctantly accepted.
This is the question posed by the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young man from Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a package of biscuits.
The case illustrates what the Times calls the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are those with "the most integration and employment opportunities", yet "the highest levels of anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest level of support for Lega Nord".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega to combat immigration and expedite the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A move that the Pope and the President of the Republic also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope, at a meeting in the Quirinal, for cooperation between Church and State to combat racism".
Students are victims of high rents of up to 900 euros per room
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious forms, with whole groups of students losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them in this amount", says the head of Sunia, Laura Mariani. "In these cities, the high demand from students leads to a distortion of the market that has also harmed other residents.
In addition, most leases involve a number of violations: free contracts, lack of registration, no rent limit, unauthorized subletters.
Sunia considers that exceptional measures are necessary, which will lead to lower rental prices through a revision of the taxation system.
A closer look at the survey reveals that in Milan a place to sleep in the Brianza district costs about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the university districts, a bed costs between 250 and 280 euros, and a single room between 370 and 500 euros.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
The rents in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome are only slightly lower: €550 in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who move to the outer districts can save money: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples, you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, and for a room, the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive areas, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest towns, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rent is 25-30% above average for foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso  the cities are closing their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas are closing down due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-screen complexes in the periphery, means in the long run the death of the single-screen cinema in the centre, a process which not only seems inevitable and irreversible, but also bears the marks of a cultural crime.
The film is about a suburban cinema and its nostalgia for a cinema that has been lost forever. "It is like losing a friend with whom you have traveled a road full of emotions", says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which won him the Oscar and the Grand Prix at Cannes 20 years ago.
The figures provided by the central trade association, the Anec, speak for themselves: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have had to close down, largely because of the cost of the closures in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely in these three regions that the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way", says Anec's president, Paolo Protti, "and while it is useful that new structures are also created, the first priority is to preserve the existing one, because if a cinema closes in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to go to a multiplex cinema on the periphery instead of the old one.
And here we have the lack of budget for the fund of the trade union: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not observe the existing laws.
To maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed".
The case of Bologna is interesting, as it is the first Italian city to decide, because of the fear of the old cinemas, to protect them by means of an agreement between the municipality and the ANEC, the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax benefits for cinema operators and transport benefits for the public: driving in the restricted areas of the centre will be allowed and parking will be reduced.
"It is a very exciting initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow our example and develop new concepts.
But of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to counter the superpower of the multiplex theater, because after all, today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of the traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between the politicians and the 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the decisions of the municipality with the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations of the public prosecutor's office of the anti-mafia authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, was also arrested, as was his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan boss, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time for a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any moral or legal norm", the lawyers write, "the two local governments agreed to pay money to the lawyer Piromalli for consulting activities".
"This allowed the Mafia group to enter the town halls in an official way and to influence the policy of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organized crime". "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, where such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the 'Ndrangheta's pressure: heroes who keep a white vest".
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, which the police say was used to decapitate the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and also then - local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 by-election.
He caused a scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the town council.
He accused the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, of making it all up for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change in the A3 project.
The Commission has also been asked to provide information on the progress of the investigation into the Dal Torrione case, which has shown the willingness to accommodate the wishes of an entrepreneur known to be a representative of the large Piromalli group, thus making the measures taken by the public administration identical with the interests of this clan.
When the energy from the waves comes out, the big ones suddenly start to go up.
It's an inexhaustible source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and it's only now that the world's major energy companies seem to grasp this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and even looking to buy, from giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years, and it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
The idea of marine energy was abandoned when oil prices collapsed in the 1980s, but now environmental organisations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy demand could be met by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice the amount of energy currently produced by nuclear power stations.
Add to that the currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to turn to marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary move.
Two years later, more and more companies in the traditional energy sector are turning to marine energy.
"Chevron is looking at these technologies", a spokesman for a company known to the US giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering the possibility of working with us".
The issue is to obtain the approval from the American Energy Commission necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially when you consider that oil is still being produced in Alaska by the United States and that President Bush has just recently started plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, the firms Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also investing in the new industry, although although the details are not known, observers are saying that there is a growing interest.
Technologies that still need to be improved.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts of environmentalists have not yet been resolved.
So far, projects like those in Portugal and Scotland have been rather small and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, large-scale energy production requires technologies with a far greater environmental impact.
There are several ways to do this: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure inside the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
The Commission has already proposed four such plants, which are awaiting approval from the State, and some of the energy generated could be used for military installations.
Verdant Power, however, is already producing power for a department store and a parking garage by using undersea turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during the tides drives the turbines, which, through the resulting rotational motion, feed the generator.
According to Verdant, there is already a long line of potential clients waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
The Institute for Power Generation Research says that the potential of tides is of particular interest at the moment.
Although irregular, tides are more predictable than wind currents, sunlight, and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest already $7.5 million in 2008  already up to $35 million is planned for 2009.
