A spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogotá
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over the Colombian capital of Bogota on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit, he flew at 100 miles per hour over the famous sanctuary of Monserrate, at an altitude of over 10,000 feet [3,000 m], where many sightseers had gathered to witness his feat.
A black box in your car?
While highway planners in the United States struggle to find the money to fix decaying highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches to the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record every mile a driver drives and relay the information to officials, are the focus of a controversial attempt in Washington and government planning offices to overhaul the outdated system of funding major U.S. highways.
The generally uninteresting aspect of the planning of the major axes has suddenly provoked a lively debate and heated alliances.
Libertarians have joined with environmental groups to lobby the government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and potentially the road you drive on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states have not waited.
They're looking at how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay based on the number of miles they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, sometimes equipped with GPS-based monitoring, on an experimental trip.
This is really necessary for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which plans for the state to begin recording the miles driven by every Californian by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the nation's Highway Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can go more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by one cent, while gasoline prices are high.
 The gas tax is simply unsustainable , said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracking devices on 500 cars to test a mileage-based payment system.
'This is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long term,' he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage-based user charge.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, since the taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market advocates at the Reason Foundation also like the idea of charging drivers per mile.
"This is not just a tax plunging into a big black hole", said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that are provided to them.
The move is also supported by two former US Transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move in the direction of mileage payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who must travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are making progress on their own.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's largest experiment.
These motorists will soon be paying the state mileage charges instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying a trial on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is looking at how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently fitted their cars with a camera, drivers were concerned that the government could be tracking their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, who heads performance management strategy at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website:  It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices. 
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that is now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car has driven, but without knowing the exact time or place.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The original purpose of the society was not to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she's testing have caught the eye of the major planners because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more likely to do this if you don't track their speed and location", said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been serious mistakes in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways of doing this.
In Oregon, planners are trying the experiment by giving motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than less.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide insurance  pay to drive  and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
 Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them , said an urban planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate on mileage payments is just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very easily handle the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
A one-off or annual supplementary tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays his fair share.
 There is no need for radical surgery when you just need aspirin, said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about their privacy and a whole bunch of other things.
David Bowie: four unreleased recordings
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day in January, he concocted a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new issues.
Four have already surfaced on the Web.
The announcement of a new David Bowie album had everyone in a state of shock.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, was released in 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician was proving that he could still be counted on to make the pop scene shine.
A feast for his fans
David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeve with The Next Day.
White Thin Duke planned to re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he cooked a real feast for his fans.
The reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be released in three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, and a DVD containing the four previously released music videos.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie actually did a video presentation of this beautiful box.
He introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, it gives a taste of his new song Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward-looking guitars and rock electricity masterfully mastered.
New music already on the air
But Atomica is not the only title that has its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available online.
The Informer is a two-faced: a haunting intro before a light-hearted cavalcade that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie have a slight reference to Elton John's Rocket Man or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: could he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, the haunting, the earth-shattering.
Bowie has a lot of fun playing the chameleon with these titles: informant in turn, man on a rocket, Martian potential...
He is both a concealer and a revealer, playing different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, most notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the Invitation to Travel campaign, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
He will appear in one of their commercials, which will be aired from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not being summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr Nicholson assured that before their release, the members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers are given proper care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of saving money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "universality of service" rule requiring personnel to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London, Ontario, reservist suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the army despite his request to stay for one more year in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case comes after Corporal Glen Kirkland testified before a parliamentary committee last month that he was pushed to the exit before he was ready because he did not meet the uniformed service rule.
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready", he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has been struggling to determine how much leeway it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit to fight.
Under current rules, soldiers who are seriously wounded have up to three years to recover.
If they don't meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the military.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicates that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to receive retirement benefits.
Liberal veteran affairs spokesman Jim Karygiannis called on Wednesday for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Disney is going to the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to give preference to tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available starting November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
The worldwide launch of the show on the Disney Group's channels is not expected until 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The animated series, designed for children between the ages of two and seven, tells the story of Callie, a city sheriff in the American West who enforces order with a magic lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for kids today", said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming more and more important", he added.
A survey released earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in mobile device use by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 years old have used a tablet or a phone, and 72% of those under 8 years old have, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate  with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence services, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said:  Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself. 
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
In the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online:  If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will make sure that it is possible. 
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following allegations that the NSA had tapped the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness - without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the US - it should be taken.
Mr Ströbele, a German Green MEP, posted a picture of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he should be given the assurance that he would be 'safe' there, the MEP said.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a  severe and sustained campaign of persecution  that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to my act of political expression.
Citizens around the world and senior officials - including in the United States - have deemed the disclosure of an unexplained system of permanent surveillance to be in the public interest.
The letter offers cooperation with the German authorities once the difficulties of the humanitarian situation have been resolved.
Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their TV in the not-so-distant future.
The Cogeco branch said Thursday that it was conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces and more options", explained Cogeco's President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even if the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise date for this new platform.
"You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail", Mr Audet stressed.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be worked out.
In the US, the popular video service is said to be in talks with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their broadcast platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its speech from the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite providers to offer customers the option of paying for services on a credit card.
"We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large packages from chains does not work", said Mr Audet.
It hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"A new kind of frame of reference will have to emerge from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy in relation to television", said the CEO of Cogeco.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and should continue with industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢ per share.
This is down from a net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company attributes this decline to depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based cable provider Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for $1.36 billion.
This was the company's first major acquisition after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
Cogeco's revenue grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
They're 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
Net income from its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenue increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased by 5546.
Mr Audet is not worried about the number of customers fluctuating like that.
The Commission's proposal is to be adopted by the end of the year.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very stiff competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef products sold by two small British retailers, the Food Hygiene Agency said today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, which were produced in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained up to 1 to 5% of horse DNA.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been in the product", the British agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked food broke out in Europe earlier this year following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission studies, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A two-vehicle collision left four people injured early Friday on Route 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving northbound in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and collided with a car coming in the other direction.
All four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal by 6:00 on Friday.
Frontier Airlines is considering charging for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines is considering charging passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in its announcement on Wednesday, it said passengers could take the unopened can with them when they disembark.
The new hand luggage charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers paid only once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was intended to encourage travelers to pay their expenses in advance.
 We do not want to impose this price , she explained.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
This fee is a way of ensuring that passengers carry less stuff on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
It's about getting Frontier's most loyal customers to understand that it's getting harder and harder to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger standing in line at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the charges before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's hand baggage fee will not be applied until summer, though no date has been set.
Passengers often rant about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They feel that the cost of handling bags is high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Many of them, however, did not pay for the cost of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company charging such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the surcharge.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on baggage costs were worth $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers discovered the unusual hand luggage fees imposed by the airline.
"I have never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career", he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added,  the passengers boarded at lightning speed .
Frontier also does like Spirit and applies a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can have it refilled free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried charging for drinks in 2008 but backed out seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's decision to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half of the loyalty miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut her mileage premiums by 25 percent on one trip.
So a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agent would earn you 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is declining and it's losing money.
Revenues fell 9%, and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to put Frontier's finances back on track by selling the airline.
The NSA blames an internal error and not hackers for the downfall of its website
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday that it was a bug that caused its public website to go down for a few hours, not hackers as some online claimed.
 NSA.gov was down for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update, the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and some users still can't access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not compromised at all".
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed responsibility for the NSA website being taken down by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once top-secret NSA, once dubbed the "No Such Agency", has come under fire and criticism in recent months following a spate of revelations about its extensive domestic and international communications surveillance programs that are part of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disgraced former NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked much speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta City Center now closed
The Delta Hotel Downtown closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who are turning it into student housing.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found new employment.
Delta promises to keep its employees on their toes.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, we met with the employees individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months", explains Félix Bisson, regional director of labour relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of Delta is taking place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to keep it running, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened", explains Paul Arsenault, who holds the Transat Chair in Tourism at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be completed within two years.
For the CEO of Titan, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing in the towel in January with the partial takeover of Goodyear's Amiens-Nord site, which had been promised to be closed, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tyre manufacturer Titan, now declares himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1137 at the plant.
The Minister for Productive Recovery, Arnaud Montebourg, had already announced this on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the project to buy the factory in January, you're back today.
You had made violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We can't understand this face-off.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg ?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the highest paid.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you ?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours handicapped France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I have no prejudice against France.
What I see is a factory that makes good farm tires, has good equipment, is well located and has room to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so bad?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with the right price and the right workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of deal do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the plant closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's say Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
So Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the plant in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it ?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all the employees accept them, the project to buy the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of employment when there are no employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg can get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan to buy the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier profit down as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial service schedule by next September.
After the test aircraft's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
The results fell short of expectations and the share price fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday lowered his rating from  overperformance  to  sector performance  due to the low potential for the stock market to rise in the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division", Cameron Doerksen said in a note to clients.
We believe that Bombardier will take new orders for its CS series aircraft as the flight test programme progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
But firm orders for the CSeries aircraft are modest so far at 177, and it seems that potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new airliner's energy efficiency and savings potential.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and chief executive, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft enters commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was moving ahead on schedule.
 The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,  Mr Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the plane's downtime.
Every builder plans differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and to provide for a period of updating, and that is what we have done.
This will be repeated throughout the flight schedule.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the others following shortly after, the company said.
Yet analysts are sceptical that the first customer could fly a C-Series aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was evaluating the entry-into-service timetable and would provide further information over the next few months.
 This delay in flight tests  although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal timetable  reinforces our opinion that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015 , said Mr Doerksen.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, compared with 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83 previously.
The backlog in the Aeronautics Division was $32.9 billion at 30 September, unchanged from 31 December of the previous year.
"In the Aerospace sector, the results were in line with our expectations, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing", said Mr Beaudoin.
Revenue from the Aeronautics industry fell by 13% to $ 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that division's revenue had increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book for the Transport Division totalled $ 32.6 billion on 30 September, a slight increase on 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division suffered from execution problems concerning some large contracts.
The executives announced that further guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board, fell 8.5 percent to 4.83 Canadian dollars on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two cavers aged 23 and 27 were missing in a ravine under the Crolles Dent since Thursday evening, we learned Friday from the Isère Cave Rescue.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in the practice and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday around 9:30 pm in order to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
The same source said that they had not been heard from since then.
"The cavers should have come out around 5am", said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at Spéléo secours in charge of the rescue organisation.
Dozens of people on site
About 20 rescue workers, ten civilians from the French Spéléo rescue team, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firemen were on the scene.
By late Friday afternoon, the two cavers had been located.
"Another group of cavers, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information on to one of the rescue teams involved in the network", explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambery, were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the grid, turned back to their tracks while waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists asked to avoid Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday called on its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging services until further notice", it said in a statement.
It finds "scandalous" the report in the Washington Post that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating the international networks that allow the two firms to synchronise their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them", added Michael Konken, president of the union which claims 38,000 members.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the Commission's proposal.
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels to 're-lift' the traffic light poles in Brussels is not to everyone's liking.
The Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched a test project on Thursday in the centre of Brussels, consisting of painting 16 traffic lights in the area with the colours of Brussels yellow and blue.
The aim is to "increase security" and "increase the identity of Brussels".
The idea is to paint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of around one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamming" the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with foolishly spending money from the people of Brussels in repainting signposts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels is continuing her operations to flamandise the capital", Mr De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted the Brussels poles herself in dark blue-black yellow.
The Commission's proposal is to establish a European Union-wide network of national authorities responsible for the protection of the environment.
The people of Brussels deserve better than to have their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is herself implementing the NVA programme.
It's time to stop the Trojan Horse of Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2 245 votes, or 0.5% of the people of Brussels!" concludes Mr De Bock.
The bridge of Buis is dismantled.
The Pont-de-Buis ecotax platform, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Crane trucks arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and the highway was diverted in the process.
The decision to dismantle the portico, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, the manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three eco-tax ports still in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of a shop of accessories for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's connected glasses.
They can buy a headset, a charger, or a storage case.
This store, strictly for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable for $ 50.
For the same price, you can also buy a micro-fiber protective cover or an in-ear earpiece.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with corrective lenses, no large-scale market launch date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I spoke of him in the present,
I was so afraid I'd forget him, or rather, I didn't know how I was going to keep "dating" him.
There is no recipe, no recipe for how to get through the wall of the invisible and find your people.
Then signs began to appear.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Other times, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at her watch that never leaves me, laid on the nightstand.
It's the image of my father smiling that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her empty body, crumpled up in that hospital bed with the wrinkled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a chilly farewell focused around the faint glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, in small appearances by day or night, a little shy, a little erased, she soon returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought which seemed to be in mourning.
And then she would reveal herself to me, revealing to me aspects of myself that I hadn't yet seen, hidden by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost the person of my mother but simply a woman whom I did not really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I was, full and whole.
This turn of my life's road remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us.
I'm like my father, "on the inside and the outside", he says.
I've always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him, and I was able to love him.
Then one day, he died.
For a long time, it was with me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I was in pain...
He spoke to me, he encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscrete.
I was able to have a personal life.
He let me have my privacy.
It went on for a long time, then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, and counseled.
I don't remember who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone but I feel them constantly near me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? What would they have thought? What would they have done?
I dream about them constantly, maybe not every night but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always one thing that keeps me from fulfilling that moment.
I often wake up in anguish when this happens to me and I feel their absence deeply.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and become part of my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The night before my ultrasound, where I had to find out the sex of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up, I got out of bed, my dad was waiting for me on the step, and he was smiling at me and happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day I felt as if he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was glad to share my plight.
And of course, there was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing that moment with him and I enjoy sharing that memory we shared after he died.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year before that, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
I mean, the shock of his disappearance was a shock to the young bachelor I was then.
I realized my grief pretty quickly, though.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am faced with difficult situations or when I have important decisions to make.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of earning a master's degree at a top school, were not, in retrospect, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are still there, so I sometimes wonder what she would want me to do at a certain point.
I am trying to live up to the generosity and upright spirit of that once fervent believer.
Now I feel her as a daily presence, a caring soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes falling on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
She died after talking to me on the phone.
I've been through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, tears that just happen, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at unusual times.
Then, time eased the pain.
All that's left is the lack, the unanswered emptiness, the need for her to confide in me, to reassure me with her sweetness.
Yet she is there, a silent presence, standing there, looking at me.
Every morning I see his worried eyes on me, the dark circles that make his eyes heavy, the lines around his lips that the cigarettes make, the wrinkles that mark the forehead on days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.
We feel his protection all the time, nothing bad can happen to us.
That was his promise on his deathbed, so we've gradually learned to smile again, and saying his name is no longer taboo, but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the dead of night when absence hurts too much, she invites in my dreams when the morale is a little bit.
We feel supported and protected in the difficult moments, and the way we look back on her makes us realize how much she was a conductor, and we try to stay on the path she had set for us.
If someone loved you very much, absence can't take them away from your heart and your memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, and I always did what he thought or what he liked.
I wasn't able to attend her funeral, and three weeks after she died, I gave birth to a little boy.
If my beliefs sometimes differ from his, I always wonder if my actions are in harmony with his view of things.
I've had problems in my work because of these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep with it and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he'll always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's been almost 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The immense pain that I felt then has of course subsided, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "arrives" in my dreams so vividly and vividly that when I wake up I am even sadder to realize that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he said, "I'm coming down", but in a voice so real that I woke up in a panic, anxious, and I turned on the bedside lamp, looking around, convinced that he was coming.
I still live in the same house, and a lot of times, I feel like I'm being watched, and I turn around to see if he's there, and I know it's him, and I'm talking to him.
I feel her presence in every room and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he left, he is and will always be the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a responsible job, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday that 964 people were killed last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it", Al-Maliki said in Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what's going on in Iraq is not fixed, it's going to spread, and what's going on in Syria is going to spread.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with aid.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug godfather of a police investigation has been jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court.
A prominent defense attorney, who had informed a drug lord of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised because of his cocaine habit.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed  Bash  and considered by criminals to be a  high-profile case , was arrested at his home in 2011 following police eavesdropping on Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officials spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the solicitor's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Bar Council dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of the class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he illegally sought information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine trafficking ring running through the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5m, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he was afraid that his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today in the Liverpool Magistrates Court, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, fell from grace after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice following a three-week trial.
He admitted to cocaine possession during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60 percent pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went back to his house, found the drugs, and they made nine phone calls.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests showed traces of the Class A drug in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, stating that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all confiscated and a hair sample was taken.
During questioning, he stated that he had an office at home and at work and that he was sometimes called by clients to his home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were in the know.
Attorney Anne Whyte said:  If anyone should know that the law should not be broken, it is a criminal lawyer. 
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary boundaries of a lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has not done his profession any honour, but rather dishonoured it.
He's gotten too close to some of his clients, particularly Scarborough, and he's let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and stated: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately".
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he started procuring drugs from criminal organisations".
His cocaine addiction permanently compromised him and made him vulnerable to the machinations of leading members of organized crime groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and establish a climate of public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating his commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
Let this be a warning to criminals so they know no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other traffickers were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta hosted a Q&A session about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Muhammad Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin is back on the stage in December.
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Room of the Motor City Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin began recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous Respect actress told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she is "happy to be back".
Menton is reducing the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of beachfront covered with a mantle of light: the heat stroke in Menton could be reduced by the lighting bill.
The fact that, unlike in many other municipalities, the tax is paid by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To reduce costs, the city is using LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the street lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting has occurred at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there are at least two injured.
The suspect is an employee of the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Passengers and staff rushed to the exits or the tarmac.
Police were quickly called to the scene and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of a parking lot at the airport.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is disrupted.
Classical music for teenagers
Each time, the target audience will be school children, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five saynettes imagined and performed by local artists, vignettes with a strong dose of humour, we allow teenagers to learn classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Lyric Art Society of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical destinations, a formula that now fills the hall at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists a chance to show off their talents.
These activities were supplemented by the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the participation of the soprano coloratura Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a for-profit activity along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a financial statement that is as sweet to the ear as a bat's air.
Without giving specific figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took the opportunity of the press conference held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future looks bright, even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant supports.
"Finances are good and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the company, a milestone we will reach in seven years", commented the director.
"I would even say beyond", added the Managing Director, Hélène Gaudreault, with a smile.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy High School in Surrey is facing six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with taking hostages, kidnapping, making threats, carrying a weapon with a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
"The quick reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident", Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will be appearing in court on Friday.
New class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit has been filed against the Holy Cross Brothers, alleging sexual assault at the St. Joseph's oratory and at several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J"., who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph oratory, where he served as a priest and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was against only three establishments, and when the settlement was announced, many people said to us: "I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The class action that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse may have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal gathers the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers of the Holy Cross.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first action, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The complaint further points out that the Congregation of Holy Cross and the separate St. Joseph Oratory "permitted sexual abuse of children", "exerted moral, religious and psychological pressure on the victims", "knew of the sexual abuse and yet suppressed it", and "knowingly and knowingly chose to ignore the issue".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Holy Cross brothers, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, and on archival research on the subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Holy Cross brother who has publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the Court has ruled that the application is admissible, the second stage, the substantive hearings, takes place.
In the first case, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix agreed to settle the case amicably before any substantive hearings were held.
Large fire in a shop
A fire severely damaged a LaSalle store in Montreal on Thursday night.
Rescue was called at about 1 a.m. Friday morning after a fire broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue near the intersection with Regan Street.
The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to bring the blaze under control.
The fire "caused significant structural damage to the building", said Montreal Fire Safety Department operations chief Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the fire department arrived on the scene.
No one was injured, but about 20 apartments on the first and second floors of this row of commercial buildings had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments might need to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical assistance in dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, taking place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote in favour of the principle of the medical aid in dying bill in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, as well as being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their lives, according to Maryse Bouvette, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association.
If we focus on palliative care in Canada, the euthanasia approach will become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life?" she laments.
Most hospice care facilities will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice president of the Alliance of Hospice Care.
Mrs Fitzback, who is also the director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection".
The director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is confusing the public about the purpose of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will follow suit.
The Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said the notion of end-of-life would have to be clarified before the bill could be adopted.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
 It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow? , the newspaper said, challenging the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
 This is a draconian and very punitive law, and we reject it,  explained Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group  owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said the new media court  will always be biased as it is an extension of the government  and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's place in the global economy.
 I hope the President will listen to us and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament , he added.
The Star newspaper reported that the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media". The Standard newspaper reported that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "have been dealt a severe blow" and slammed the bill as "draconian".
The passage of the bill comes as part of a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping centre last September.
Kenyan media outlets have angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly looting the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn following a media outcry.
Under the new bill, media outlets could be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being  expelled  or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation,  even a single ticket is enough to paralyze most FM stations .
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Left to their own devices, politicians would bankrupt the country and return us to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of popular anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission and reinstated their staggering tax-free monthly salaries of around 532,000 shillings, which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir in the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital in 2012-2013.
The pharmacy department has suffered a serious shortage of staff due to the number of people who have retired, taken maternity leave or left the firm.
Nearly 30% of the required staff was lacking, making this fiscal year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to hire independent labour, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
The problem was not solved by the use of the repair service, explained Mrs Beaudet.
We've been streamlining or downsizing some of our activities inside the facility to keep things from getting out of hand.
We've certainly worked hard to get our young people interested in coming and staying here.
There's a combination of circumstances that put us in a bad spot last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is expected to be much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already three pharmacists have returned to work after maternity leave and three more have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain students have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain in the employ of the CSSS.
"Now it's much better", the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the fiscal year, we'll have seven new pharmacists and three returning maternity cases.
This will therefore be in addition to what we started last year.
Growing Needs
The situation is still delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals and the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations like the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have a young workforce and we employ many young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always go on three maternity leave when things are going well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old supermodel doesn't start his movie career with a small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play the young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters, will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a woman in her 40s who has been addicted to sex since her teens.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her older sister is striking: a slender figure, a diaphragmatic complexion and French-English origins.
And not to mention a certain taste for risk: the one who did not hesitate to pose nude on a piece of ice-cold paper will be shown in far more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
A clip from Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their shame in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the waist, the star; below, the stunt.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses to their last shred, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished making a name for herself.
A room at the CGR in Narbonne was evacuated on Thursday evening
On Thursday night, the first screening of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, following a pricking in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the school director evacuated the hall and alerted the fire department to a suspicious smell.
About 70 people came out of the meeting.
The people were examined and a full reconnaissance of the room yielded nothing.
Bad joke against the backdrop of tear gas?
Or an unintentional incident ?
Still, the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers to the hilt.
The room was aired and everything was put back in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers could enjoy the images again.
On screen only.
She's trying to import two kilos of cocaine in pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins which had been emptied beforehand.
The drugs were then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
It's part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, a spokeswoman for the CBSA.
All I can tell you is that she was coming into the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services agents at the Montreal-Trudeau airport have made 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services agents in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Airstrikes against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese military, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new attack by the air force of the IDF on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances that were almost identical to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, an anonymous US official also confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-surface missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had made no secret of their irritation at Washington's disclosure of the attack, which could have forced President Assad to respond.
Ukraine is on the verge of bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, casting doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's government debt rating has been downgraded to "B-", dropping into the speculative investment category.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least a one in three chance of it being lowered again within a year.
"It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will secure enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs", the agency said.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves decreased by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This makes it difficult to repay loans taken abroad.
As these reserves, which are used by the authorities to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapse, the agency sees a devaluation as more likely, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to pay for its gas imports from Russia, which accuses it of not paying a bill of $882 million.
The announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government at a time of heightened tensions with its neighbour Russia, angered by Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, up from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has run into a budget deficit, has been seeking help from the International Monetary Fund for months, which granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far only released $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new installments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including increasing the price of gas to the population.
After another failed mission to the country, the IMF this week found that "the high external financing needs" were a "vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled for 2015, the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also highlights the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions on the release of opposition member Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signature of the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term related to the reaction of Russia", explained S&P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that if a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev is established, it should increase border controls for imported goods.
US green light to the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objections from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to creating the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second largest agency in the world, Omnicom, and the third largest, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe have today announced the expiry of the time for consideration of the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, as provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", the two groups announced in a joint statement.
They also said that they had received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period foreseen by the HSR in the United States and the clearance decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
'The merger is also subject to further regulatory approvals and shareholder approval by both groups,' they add.
Congolese army chases after M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units will pursue M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, on the border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat after being driven from the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) areas it controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and prosecute them wherever they hide because they are criminals", Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been torturing the Congolese people for too long.
It's time to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the villages under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel's political leader, told RFI that the military setbacks would not alter his demands for peace talks.
According to the Ugandan mediators, the fighting resumed in Kampala on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills overlooking Bunagana, the last rebel-held town to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the rebels occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison's flight and the passivity of the Monusco Blue Helmets.
The fall of Goma led the UN Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid reaction brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
The FARDC staff was reorganized and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of advancement of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end", predicts Congolese affairs expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa has managed to defeat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which vehemently denies it, of providing military support to the M23, which was originally formed by former Congolese soldiers who had mutinied.
The British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation following the shelling of Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, residents of Bunagana took to the streets of the town to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unthinkable that we would ever be liberated by the army", said a resident of this neighbourhood.
"We lived in terror (of the M23) we are traumatized", added this man.
Tests performed by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have been found to be negative, the health ministry announced.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 thus remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of having the disease after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil company, reported on Friday a decline in quarterly profit due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased but fell short of the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net income declined to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a 25 percent growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Chevron's main competitor Exxon Mobil reported a decline in net profit on Thursday, despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint found admissible
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (SRSB) has since the beginning of the school year required a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students on two-residence school transport, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service which is being proposed by the commission and I was interested", explains Mrs Lefèvre.
According to the applicant, the CSRS was invited to mediate and requested additional time to reflect on the matter.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions", said Mrs. Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Regional School Board declined to comment.
The organisation only indicated that mediation is part of the process when a complaint is made.
Imbroglio around the closing of the Hotel-Dieu emergency
Faced with the pressure exerted for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "postpone the timetable for implementing the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency rooms, which will not be able to take place on 4 November".
A request officially made "to run no risk on the care of the emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but which also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months before the municipal elections.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred in the APHP.
From 4 November, the firefighters - who accounted for about a quarter of the 40 000 emergency department visits to the Hôtel-Dieu each year - will all be instructed to take the 30 or so serious cases a day to the emergency departments of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of 4 November also coincides with the renewal of the residence permits.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the emergency room interns will give way to five general medical interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of the internal medicine beds, it's scheduled for later this month.
"The emergency reception service at the Hotel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4", assures Loïc Capron, the president of the medical establishment committee (CME) of the APHP, who supports the project of the management.
"On November 4th, there will be no more patients brought by the fire brigade, only people coming on their own", confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergency", he said, arguing that the SMUR vehicles are always on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he added.
But it is the ARS that decides whether the ER is to be closed.
"Things are being done gradually", says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, who said on 4 November that "there will be no change in terms of service provided".
"The minister lied to us or was lied to", laments emergency physician Gérald Kierzek.
He was removed from his post as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the fray against the reorganisation project, and he described himself as a "warning" against a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergency rooms that were renovated less than five years ago", he said.
He said that "if the other emergency departments in Paris could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
They're regularly clogged up.
For example, there are sometimes nine-hour waiting times at Lariboisière's emergency room.
The ARS argues that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
The ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" which has been in operation since 7 October and which should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of a 'permanent outpatient care' system.
"What happens if we ask people to self-diagnose", wonders Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the notion of a 'serious emergency' is 'dangerous' and marks a 'medical regression'.
It's gonna be like the level three maternity ward.
People aren't crazy, they'll go wherever there's the best care.
If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We're going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we're going to think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor in Paris and elected from the 4th district, clearly announced that "even if the Parisian UMP was in favour of maintaining the emergency rooms at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
The PS candidate Anne Hidalgo, on the other hand, again recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark a clear disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of transfer to other hospitals.
Obama ends wiretapping of IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop eavesdropping on the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a US official said on Thursday.
The move is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA's wiretap business after revelations by former analyst Edward Snowden, who is a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the beginning of the scandal.
When asked about this, a U.S. official said: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington".
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the practice to stop in recent weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the eavesdropping at UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but allowed them to continue.
The commission has introduced new restrictions on the data intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
UN welcomes new targets to fight against poverty
The United Nations is now set to work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to fight poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in highlighting the  Sustainable Development Goals  to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to go beyond national interests.
 I am pleased that Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs) , he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow as conflicts between powerful personalities flare
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, who is bowing to them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration.
 We want peace to return; we want stability  said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of a private equity firm.
Concerned for the future of her country, she traded her work clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not be plunged back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are high for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the US' Anadarko.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo have mutually rejected responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack against its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The assault on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo's bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo's spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds Renamo responsible for starting the conflict, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a loser who wants to use whatever power he has left to try to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
'We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,' said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
 These are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are constantly arguing , explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators, and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes won by Renamo has been steadily declining since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza  who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year  wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
 He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , said Mr Mazanga.
It's unclear exactly what Renamo's capability is, but it has conducted disruptive lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the collisions have occurred in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was wrongly timid when asked if Renamo would make the threat again.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique", Mazanga said.
Instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
 People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems , he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
 Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to get peace, they want to have free access to roads , he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models", says the author.
Thor's Legend might show that  brute force does not hold sway against subtle cunning , while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, too scandalous and in some cases, too obscene to be taught in school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are  openly didactic  makes the children  completely drop out , the messages being  sublimated  into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said:  You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight. 
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it needs to be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than stated.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
A Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to these sources, the activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian Territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: US 'goes too far' admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, admitted Secretary of State John Kerry, in Washington's first admission of the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to make sure that this does not happen again in the future", John Kerry said at a conference in London, which he attended from Washington on Thursday, October 31 via video link.
In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the US foreign minister gave a long explanation for the intelligence and intelligence gathering practices by the need to fight terrorism and prevent possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and the attacks in London in July 2005, John Kerry said that US authorities had since foiled many plots of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to know about these plans in advance", argued the head of US diplomacy.
And, as John Kerry told the Europeans, 'I can assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.'
But we're trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it has gone too far in an inappropriate way", admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to comment on the international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that President Obama was "committed to trying to clarify and reexamine these practices so that no one feels deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to flare up this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, citing documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program dubbed "MUSCULAR", and run with the NSA's British counterpart, GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails to text or audio or video documents.
These intercepts would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement with these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has intercepted massive amounts of data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and leaks in the American press claiming that the US president was unaware of such wiretaps, Barack Obama refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
But the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had intercepted tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even blamed the European intelligence services, who allegedly intercepted these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
The EU's position on the issue was that the EU should be able to take action against the US in the event of a war.
And the controversy extended Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also angered China.
Paris Saint-Germain will host Lorient on Friday without its star player, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, who lead the league ahead of Monaco on goal difference, released the list of players retained for this match on day 12, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "wounded", without specifying the nature of the injury.
He was, however, suffering from inflammation of his left knee when he returned to selection earlier this month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The Père Lachaise crematorium holds a secular ceremony at 11 a.m. in memory of all the deceased cremated in its facility during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris, is expected to attend, and will then explain at a press conference her proposals for the funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people are choosing cremation over burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, only 15% of them choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee of Funeral Ethics, Damien Le Guay, emphasizes the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence to the body of the loved one", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in a very short time, not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompani the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "effacement of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is it that what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries, is still badly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new phenomenon", says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society for Thanatology and author of the book Taming Death.
It was only tolerated by the Catholic Church in 1963, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame the cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The Ipsos annual survey shows a very strong attachment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77% of the French want a church for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73 percent of those who have chosen cremation want a ceremony.
66% of atheists and non-believers want it too.
Crematories have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For the past ten years, they have been trying to save families from the violence of waiting, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the handing over of the ashes", observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now have a master of ceremonies, who, in the presence of the body, perform the following ritual: welcome the assembly, name the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case at the crematorium of Père Lachaise since 1998.
The master of ceremonies are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, on the day of La Toussaint, several commemorative ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who were cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of the ceremonies is being streamed live online for those who cannot make the trip.
The crematorium has given us permission to relay it.
The Seyne, the relocation because of rats turns into controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their ground floor apartment in the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office, has proposed, exceptionally and temporarily, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has reached an exaggerated scale, according to Joël Canapa, the director of the agency.
There's always been rats in the cities.
The company de-roots the roads twice a year, and we also take care of the inhabitants' needs.
We have thus carried out 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats are not swarming in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, dewatering products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, you're not going to kill a baby.
"We didn't invite the rats into our house", said the family man who moved from his home to the hotel.
Soon we are penniless and are waiting for a new house, at the same price as the old one.
The Tokyo stock market closed down 0.88%
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The stock has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, which has hurt export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index fell by 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57, and the Topix index fell by 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony's shares fell more than 11 percent to 1,668 yen.
A house on fire in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters have been dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The fire broke out in a three-bedroom, four-story house behind the courtyard of the Seminary of Quebec City.
All the tenants were absent at the time of the fire.
The fire was brought under control within an hour of the arrival of the fire department, who responded in large numbers.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they actually saw smoke coming.
"Then the alarms came one after the other, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here", explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec fire brigade.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker: The New Yorker is the oldest of the five comedy festivals .
New York City is arguably the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes right in front of the audience, in the tone of conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was most recently taken over by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, with over 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
 Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club , Hirsch said.
We started this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of Stand Up for Heroes, a comedy and music benefit for veterans held at Madison Square Garden, which will feature Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown, as has the comedy world.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone on to non-traditional circuits, including hosting shows on small television networks such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his on-scene debut in a sitcom on a cable channel ( The League  on the theme of FXX's joyously lascivious fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Slate has appeared on Saturday Night Live and was a cast member on Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with singular voices (the pessimistic surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic racial justice advocate W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of this year's festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called  Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg .
The meeting is at the City Hall in midtown Manhattan.
 The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry's work,  said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he'd go down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here".
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about large stocks offset a report showing China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The benchmark price of US crude oil for delivery in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning trading in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, the supply increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector that came in Friday, showing growth in activity, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery may continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a two-decade-long decline in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refiners, dropped 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Texas's abortion rights are under attack
A federal appeals court reinstated in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a bill passed in this state in July that largely undermines abortion rights will be able to take effect.
The appeals court ruling means that doctors who perform IVF will have to have "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to make a diagnosis or to provide treatment.
The defenders of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be denied access to these institutions.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled that the provisions on admission privilege were unconstitutional, a day before the law was to take effect.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the Republican candidate for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the lower court ruling that blocked the law's enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this matter is scheduled for January.
The New Star made a strong comeback in terms of viewership, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV sets, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show on time?
Some 10,000 candidates showed up for auditions for this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
None of the candidates seem to have really scored on this first award.
As every year, the first audition shows a wide variety of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some have found their way.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and some have even gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are still there, season after season.
Others are just ambitious to make a laugh.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD's search and seizure policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's search and seizure program and dismissed the case.
The United States Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was stayed pending the outcome of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The City appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to appoint an inspector to assist the police department in modifying its policy and the associated training program.
The appeals court heard arguments on the motion for a stay on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge should be removed from the case because she violated the judge code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their screening and search program.
It appointed an external auditor to oversee changes including policy, training and oversight reform, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in the areas where the highest number of audits are taking place.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the City is expected to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of search and seizure has been criticized by many civil rights advocates.
This system of checks and searches has been around for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its all-time high in 2011 with 684,330 checks that mostly involved black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minority backgrounds, and became a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's search and seizure program say they will end unfair practices, allow for a more efficient and trusted police force, and could change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say the changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, waste money and not solve the larger problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been drastically reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending the search and seizure practices, which are constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its searches.
The tenants have to go vote, because each of them pays an average of $100 a month on the price of the house that goes to the city in taxes.
When the owner pays $5,000 in city taxes, he divides that amount between each unit.
We're forced to raise the rent to help pay for the new taxes.
By going to the polls, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates have told us they'll tackle the outrageous debt.
We can't afford to buy $100,000 worth of fireworks, $4 million to $5 million worth of land just in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
He entered the 500 square meters of the Elysée kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook rose through all the ranks until he became chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their holiday resorts, and nurtured countless of the world's greats in a near-anonymous way that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at the age of 60.
The man with open face, skull and glasses of intellectual, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin is a holder of a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Solon.
"I've been from one castle to another!" says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the habits of the six presidents for whom he has officiated, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his wife or partner who chooses the menus", he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women from the kitchen of the Elysée!
Unlike some heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all greedy", Bernard Vaussion decries kindly.
Jacques Chirac had a "slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were empty!
As for François Hollande, who reintroduced cheese, "he is someone who likes to eat" and "there is little he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific diet demands".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure he felt, especially at state dinners at the Elysée: "between 200 and 250 people had to be served in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
Those people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former head of the kitchen at the Elysée, who had a drink with his team, family and friends on Tuesday night, leaves with a pinch of his heart".François Hollande came to greet me".
He said good things.
"His human side came out", he said.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic home built in 1850 was the victim of the flames in Old Quebec Friday afternoon.
The four-bedroom apartment building at 15 Hébert Street has been the subject of three fire alarms.
The fire started in the front, but it went up three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said that the quick response of firefighters prevented the spread of the flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built close together.
The burned-out house had four units, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, although water damage was caused.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin of the fire, but the sappers have ruled out the possibility of foul play.
The Wolf of Wall Street: The second trailer is out
Martin Scorsese has released footage of his upcoming film in which the title role of an ambitious New York stockbroker is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget being reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will be doing a haircut of you as a deranged trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a "Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a massive Wall Street bribery case".
In the '80s, Jordan Belfort then set up a scam that would make him a very, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that followed.
There's no limit to the man, the party, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the key words in this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that brought them together in Shutter Island.
The new Scorsese was delayed due to its long editing.
It seems the movie is finally running 2:45.
On December 25th, he'll be able to barely enter the Oscars race.
Coulson used the phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used  phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation  to try to confirm a fake tip on a link involving then-acting Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "pretty special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper had commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and to "permanently park outside her door", but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
 The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man who stands outside people's homes hoping to catch them, he is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it, Mr. Edis said.
He said that NotW used three methods to investigate the subjects: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
He's obviously aware of the second one, surveillance, he can't be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say "of course if".
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW editorial office when a source, feeling a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, stated that he was told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles".
A tape recording of hacked voice messages on his phone at least three times was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the private detective's computer that pertained to Ms. Pawlby and her sister filed in a "Projects" folder.
During the period the detective was investigating her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have overseen the surveillance of Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voice message he left for her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said:  I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to tell Charles. 
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking the phone.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister amidst the outbreak of violence
The US president was scheduled to meet on Friday, November 1, 2013 with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who is seeking US assistance in fighting the worst wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released by Iraqi authorities on Friday, November 1.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher toll of 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence has been increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
Nearly two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence is raising fears of a new outbreak as neighboring Syria is engulfed in a civil war.
Bombs are dropped on markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are being shot dead in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces are also frequently targeted.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complain of being politically marginalized and subjected to unjust arrests, has fuelled this outbreak of violence.
New violence killed four people in northern Iraq on Friday, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of bombings, including the explosion of five car bombs in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Sunni extremist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda, which is also involved in the Syrian civil war.
Nouri al-Maliki wants a "world war" against al-Qaeda. He wants to see the world in a war.
The violence is the focus of talks in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise of ending military involvement in that country, had painted a hopeful picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased his meetings with the executive and congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, as partly responsible for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policies".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing blames a Uyghur group for the Tiananmen Square attack
China's internal security chief on Friday blamed a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists for the car bombing that killed five people in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Monday.
The SUV ran into the crowd in the famous square of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous crackdown of 1989, and caught fire, killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Ji Menganzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic Movement of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority in Xinjiang, refer to the Chinese province as East Turkestan.
The Chinese government blames the movement for the frequent outbreaks of violence there, fuelled by demands for independence.
"The violent terrorist incident that happened in Beijing was organized and premeditated", Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the East Turkestan Islamic Movement", he added, his words being quoted by the China News Agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin, and said that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers full of petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
Forty-two people were injured in the incident.
The East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has embarked on a major survey around the world on how parishes are handling sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage.
The survey asks respondents how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being married.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to obtain as many responses as possible.
The information will be used for a major family gathering that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was genuine and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to survey parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops posted the poll online, asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The M23's hard-liners, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at almost 2000 meters altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night", a resident of Jomba told AFP by telephone at around 12:30 and said a girl was wounded by a bullet in the morning.
'The intensity of the fighting has decreased a bit,' he added, 'it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels back a bit.'
According to the witness, who asked not to be named, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "sweep operation".
The sound of small arms fire was heard very clearly behind him.
An AFP journalist could hear the blasts of heavy weapons from Bunagana, the last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday.
According to a source at the UN Stabilisation Mission in the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase" as the FARDC "surrounded the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but has provided the government troops with crucial support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
By late afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well-stocked with ammunition, were marching toward the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
In the meantime, the FARDC has been engaged in a number of actions, including the seizure of the vessel in question and the seizure of the vessel belonging to the FARDC.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila again called on rebels on Wednesday night to "voluntary demobilization" or be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results so far.
On the ground, the political leaders of M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have completed the talks, it is now up to the Ugandan mediation to arrange the signing", said Roger Lumbala, vice-chairman of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
M23 was born out of a mutiny in April 2012 by former rebels, mostly Tutsi, who were integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its underground is rich in coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement of returning to the DRC that had started in the morning was reversed by midday.
"This morning we turned back to go to our fields, but the military told us to retreat", Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
It seems like the gunfire is getting closer to the population.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, that stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French, singing and dancing productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris is finally finding its voice.
It's a revolution: the musical à la française is a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre Dame de Paris to Mozart to rock opera, most attempts ended in ridicule.
And the successes like Cabaret and Les Misérables had the aura of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage­Entertainment in Mogador changed the game.
Today, both these stages handle the titles like hit tubes.
The first one, this Christmas, will be reprising his excellent My Fair Lady and announcing the next one, the world premiere of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could be one of the biggest hits of the season.
On the other stages, musical shows such as "1789", "The Lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are set to the tune of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histories of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the success so hard won.
How are French musicals progressing?
Supply has multiplied.
First, there are the musical shows which change according to the producers' wishes...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump back fifteen years, saying that you can serve pretty much anything when you have Matt Pokora as your headline.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet which take us back to the golden age of Broadway and into the world of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularises Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them into French.
French independent producers are making a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" and "The Awakening of Spring" are struggling to get funding.
Do we have enough Broadway-quality performers who can sing, act and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who are moving from project to project.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy, it's very different.
These are the skills that young people are being trained in many schools.
Jobs are plentiful in regional theatres, touring, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of vacancies.
Why are the country tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often theatre for adults rather than young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same kids who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
The introduction of attractive young men (often talented) as headliners for a musical show is a sure sign of the enthusiasm of these young women and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial zenith.
The mayonnaise was made in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to fit in all the great halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
One seriously injured in a ghost driver accident on the ring in Brussels
A road accident left one seriously injured on Friday morning at around 5.30 on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A female driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is uninjured.
The ring road has been closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the scene of the accident, while the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams as the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore have been diverted through this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His life expectancy is no longer in the range of active, but he's still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It's been closed until further notice.
DRC: the army prepares a new assault
Children play on a charred armored vehicle belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi Hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
All that will remain is Runyonyi Hill.
"The one in Chanzu is not very strategic", the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told AFP.
Mr. Paluku is planning to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
The town is situated on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was retaken by the Democratic Republic of Congo Armed Forces on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreductibles have been entrenched at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
A resident in Jomba who reported close fighting throughout the day on Thursday said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the previous day and were buried.
A girl was shot and three others were wounded, including one seriously, who was evacuated by the FARDC, the witness added, quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two warring parties have not reported any casualties.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a fine day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's national intelligence agency, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of US intelligence, reiterated in September that the US does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to  steal industrial secrets from foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits. 
But ever since whistle-blower-turned-consultant Edward Snowden began revealing his endless treasure trove of information about U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders have been wondering whether to believe the whistle-blower.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have fuelled business paranoia about state surveillance more than ever.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps for a decade, was the last straw.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely potential targets as well.
Snowden has made transparent the extensive collaboration between US intelligence and corporations.
I think it is conceivable that this data could be used in their mutual interest.
 Germany must wake up , says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the US is as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capacity and believe that it should work to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do it", says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations came as a shock to some companies that had previously thought China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is happening in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the US is governed under US law and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10% of non-US members have abandoned their plans to use a US cloud storage service provider after the revelations about the US data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: "Our customers are asking us a question today that they didn't ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will stay physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be guarded at all costs.
It's not surprising that there's economic espionage.
There's always been.
 This has been a recurring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion , says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemicals company BASF.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would give an advantage to an opponent.
Large corporations have long been the ones to send the message that it is unwise to pick up a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of the car manufacturer Audi, says that collecting cell phones before board meetings so they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its managers to consider using only prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad because of the risk of compromising the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
 SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BfV in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) issued in February cited France, along with Russia and Israel, as the second-highest perpetrators of economic intelligence hacking behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member of a prominent German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month:  The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. 
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died under unusual circumstances believe their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled up in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found Jan. 11 wedged into a mat, leaning against the steps of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators have concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes those conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead, as stated in the sheriff's findings.
"They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense", Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were made for the sole purpose of covering up the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
 They sent their son to school with a briefcase and they returned him in a body bag , he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'm gonna follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
 I consider that there is a sufficient basis  to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died from "positional asphyxia".
However, a second autopsy identified a different cause of death, according to Moore.
 Several questions still need to be answered or confirmed, he said.
Moore added that if he uncovered evidence that would warrant a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in southern Georgia ordered authorities Wednesday to hand over all surveillance footage that investigators had reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage would provide clues as to the circumstances of his death.
CDC releases allergy advice for children to schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in school children.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government has issued since the number of school-age children with food allergies has skyrocketed.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stockpile of epinephrine  the EpiPen brand autoinjector being the most commonly used  to be able to respond quickly in the event of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I feel like something is stinging my tongue", "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue", or "I have tingling sensations on my tongue".
The NSA case highlights the complete absence of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand publicly offends itself by summoning the US ambassador on October 21st, and on the other hand forbids the Bolivian presidential plane from flying over its territory, based on the rumor that Edward Snowden was on board?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance of all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the Le Monde columns a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the Quai d'Orsay wiretaps by the NSA ?
Wouldn't that be a little bit of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks sheds light on the analysis of political and other issues by US diplomacy around the world, we consider that this is an important illumination from the perspective of American power.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any way to indignate ourselves with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from intelligence provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The introduction of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, for the last ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on an almost daily basis, which are described by both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France, for example, may be required to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services, and in return - as has already been said - the Americans can give information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, as the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of the violations of freedoms.
What is the United States really at risk of?
Even if we denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk for the Americans may be doubled.
The first is when their allies -- and this has been the case recently -- learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest levels of their state, have been under surveillance.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have become strained.
Another effect may be more economical: in the light of the revelations, more and more European and South American companies are reluctant to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to US laws and therefore to the NSA's control.
The last element: the massive movement of revelations by media around the world, which is helping to start a debate on the surveillance practices of intelligence services that until now were almost non-existent, could lead legislators, including in the US, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose  sex indeterminate 
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third gender for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The gender of newborn children will no longer be rigidly assigned at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the gender of their child, allowing them to write an  undetermined  or  unspecified  on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who may be making hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman".
I'll be the patchwork the doctors created, bruised and bruised.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexuality being one of the group of sixty or so diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sex identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, and then wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexuality expert, said that the new German law  seems like a good idea .
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
 Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children, he added.
It's possible to do a sex assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not linked to gender but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and height), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the scale of harassment and violence and prejudice-motivated crimes.
Young boys who are gender non-conforming now have camps that are specifically for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to list their gender as male, female or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognised as gender-neutral after winning her appeal to keep her gender unspecified for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F  X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this predominantly Catholic country signed a petition calling for the  gender theory  to be removed from textbooks.
The American Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that  since the world is being dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are being overturned. 
In Maryland, the mother of a newborn also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a gender to be assigned to babies at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child", she said on the website for new parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had both sexes.
And it was only a decade ago that the medical community saw gender as a piece of slate that could be erased and redrawn.
But now, many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and that doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their sex reassignment when they grow up.
 In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency , Drescher said.
When these kids were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was pioneered by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He coined the term  gender identity and argued that social and environmental cues  how parents raise a child  interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as  John/Joan , his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to have him castrated entirely, with his testicles removed, and to raise him as a girl.
 Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it was not the case, Drescher said.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors  still repeat this pattern .
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex-change operations say they are not satisfied with the result.
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
The doctors couldn't really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones when she was 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for her medical records.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth and no one had ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sex organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing treatment with testosterone and having his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law  is inviting labeling and stigmatization .
 Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an "undetermined" sex, she said.
We're afraid it might encourage the intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we haven't seen what the law was going to do, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supported the Australian law because it allows adults to choose to be recognised as a third gender.
 Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender, she added.
The German law concerns the assignment of sex at birth.
It's not a battle young kids should be fighting at that age.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will  hold parents and children  accountable.
Dr. Baratz' daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a resident in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
The law gives parents a certain amount of latitude so they don't have to make hasty decisions , said Baratz.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time limit before entering  masculine  or  feminine .
So, all is well  you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and you're enjoying the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush into surgery that's irreversible.
 It puts the children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing , she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with  and that is a great thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes his government will last until 2015 despite the tensions between the left and right in the ruling coalition as the Senate vote to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office approaches.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "firmly the intention" to continue governing with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The Italian upper house of parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former Council President who was convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where his opponents outnumber his supporters, votes to impeach him.
But part of his camp, grouped around the People of Freedom (PDL) national secretary Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to yield to Berlusconi's injunctions, who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The LA Times reports that a TSA agent and a suspect were injured in the exchange of fire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the tragedy said they responded to a call reporting "multiple injuries".
"Police are on the scene", the airport tweeted, with television footage showing people being evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting", a spokesman for the US Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
Local ABC broadcast showed one person being evacuated on a stretcher, and another being carried in a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at approximately 9:30 local time (12:30 Montreal time) at the airport's Terminal 3, the airport said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that terminals two and three are being evacuated.
A TSA spokesman was not immediately able to confirm whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas Palestinian Islamist militant and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip on Thursday, health sources said.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army has merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, which was dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as giving up Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to The New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann,  Double Down: Game Change 2012 .
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's close aides had conducted "deep group work and polls" in late 2011 to see if Biden's ouster could help Obama's reelection bid as his hopes dimmed.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, aimed at gauging what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the vote.
The possibility of an exchange is a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign headquarters and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisors - including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew the change was under consideration.
Double Down indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their close personal ties, before ultimately deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had looked at a whole range of questions, and this was one of them", Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president was not in shape, so we were like, "Sir, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "concerted", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in finding out whether the change would be beneficial in the election.
 Campaigns don't spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking action , Martin said on AC360.
However, it's unclear whether Obama was aware that his team was looking into the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he did not think the president knew about the possible change, the former secretary general admitted it was possible that Obama knew.
Martin added that  Double Down  did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn't know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was under consideration.
"Maybe", said Martin.
You want some fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first fluorescent ice cream made from jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it glow.
Chris explains that since ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick it, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's something incredible but we're still in the early days of production, and 2g of this stuff costs about £200".
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level goes up and the ice starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinarily bright effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice I've ever made because the luminescence of jellyfish is worth four times more than gold.
So each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But she has good taste.
Charlie's experimental-step company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I really would like to develop an invisible ice cream".
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session .
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the East Hampton Star regional newspaper and addressed to residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his musician's hands cleaving the air", writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also said that she had promised her husband a week before he died to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the past few years.
And even though we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the great joy of life that he had", she added.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late, and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today I became more pinger.
I haven't handed out a single candy in the last two years, and I'm definitely not going to do it again this year.
But the stats show that I'm the big bad guy when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
The thing I look forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk men from space will be in our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most searched disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We dressed our dogs up last year, and to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed up as hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't mess around.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
That is about 272 million pounds of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go candy hunting in their neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Actually, we're going to buy and, let's not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
Corn candy is the one thing we don't want to eat; and yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like Terror Behind the Walls, which is actually a real prison, Howl-O-Scream, and The House of Shock.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome pictures of you peeing on yourself that your friends post on Facebook that you can't get rid of and that a guy you like leaves a comment on that looks like "pretty head".
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin into a lantern shape is like decorating a Christmas tree -- it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "baby pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lighted pumpkins that are slowly withering on your porch were probably from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to carve their 2,000-pound pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will set up an in-house bad bank structure with £38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a move designed to relax its relations with London and speed up its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of uncertain assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned up its balance sheet in three years.
RBS also said it would put in an additional £4 to £4.5 billion of impairment provision for the quarter, a write-off linked to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also explained that this internal restructuring would free up GBP 10 to 11 billion of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the 'bad bank' would be a way of putting the past behind it, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, look to the future and the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for the customer and for the UK", new chief executive Ross McEwan told the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, the CEO of Bowler Motorsport said:  The rally fans who join Bowler have changed. 
Not all of them are experienced, some seeking excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of rally raiding.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle  the championship is going to be really exciting 
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost pup after being trapped 50 feet above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry.
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a car accident with no gravity.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
The firefighters came down the cliff to save the dog from certain death.
A puppy was lucky to escape the worst after firefighters were called in to retrieve it safely as it was perched 50 feet above ground on the unstable ledge of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped from a car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and appealed on social networking sites after she disappeared into the quarry following a minor accident.
At approximately 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with a good eye walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, stuck 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and came down to rescue Ruby using a pet carriage to carry her up the cliff.
Emergency services specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation".
It was right in the middle of the cliff, 50 feet from the summit and 50 feet from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue. She was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
I can't believe someone noticed the dog.
Emergency services specialist Peter Lau said:  Ruby was very lucky to get out unscathed. 
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said:  I was terrified watching the rescue. 
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The vet said if she was too exhausted and passed out, she'd probably have fallen.
The fire department was amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each one of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: 'We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move.'
The fire department was great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry claimed to have dined with the rock veteran and explained, "He hit on me when I was 18".
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind".
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies making advances" to Katy Perry.
The rep added:  Maybe she's confusing him with someone else. 
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing is blaming a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia", the head of Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website late Thursday.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has named a specific organization since Monday's bombing.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several countries in Central Asia, drove their cars loaded with petrol canisters against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of China's Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 as one of the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free-trade area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper has pointed out the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and it was to be expected).
Nor did anyone say that the EU member states spend a lot of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for all that it wants to get from the Scots.
So this is a story that is not a story.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the myth that independence means passport controls more than 40 years ago.
Yet, an interesting point has been overlooked in this interpretation of a dusty old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, really?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
The real news about Europe is that the great post-war plan to unify Europe has come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposed to the EU or advocating the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming out of nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the idea of a federal Europe.
However, the recent economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the strain on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - this was true only of Greece.
The European system has instead imposed on its members exchange rates favourable to German exporters - which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, the southern European countries are faced with an inherent productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way out is to make the deep cuts in wages and public spending that Berlin has encouraged.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise about productivity in Europe.
Following the green  energy policies imposed by Brussels  which are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer  European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a cost-defying disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry will not be prevented by all the wage freezes in the world from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is raging, especially in France, one of the EU's major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy to scramble.
The result: Marine Le Pen's far-right, anti-European National Front party has just won a crucial by-election, sending the ruling Socialists back to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create an anti-single currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make a good showing in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
I think that very soon anti-European and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the free Europe of (sovereign) nations favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will have their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will look kindly upon the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland?
We can decide to be a region of (essentially) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending people to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could settle for a freer European agreement provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise we should follow Norway's example and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is  and is notably  the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the deep cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it means accepting the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the obesity epidemic may be a trigger for early puberty
The tendency for early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at seven or eight?
At the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
 I spend a lot of time reassuring parents  in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty , said Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast growth, underarm and pubic hair, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there's been only a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, up from 12 years old in 1970.
 Once the breast has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first menstrual periods appear , said Kaplowitz, also the author of  Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem .
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is debate as to what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered  premature  when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows or stops - something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments exist to delay the onset of menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone ageing that can stunt growth and small stature in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication but acknowledges that  controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others .
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their periods.
 They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues , said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock", recalls a woman whose 10-year-old daughter got her first period.
Even though there were signs and we had talked about the period, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories about the causes of precocious puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is that obesity is an epidemic.
He was involved in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked body fat percentage to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genetics.
Another problem: Although boys have younger facial and pubic hair, the tendency toward true precocious puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common, even in infants and toddlers.
 We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty , said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician about how to communicate with their child.
"It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected", Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls who have premature puberty need to be reassured that, even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is a part of life.
The Coen Brothers' tribute to folk music
Inside Llewyn Davis, by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unable to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their eyes on rising American movie star Oscar Isaac, 33, as well as global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac proves himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she's gone from the rich, plush appearances of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" to less flashy clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the gun-sharp language when she speaks.
Inside Llewyn Davis is a week-long tale of the trials of a folk singer who can't get his head around the world and is angry with the world.
He's taking the back-to-back replacements in the studios.
He's homeless, and he's been wandering around the couches of his friends, who are still eager to see him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not career-oriented but has integrity, with self-destructive behavior", Ethan Coen, who won several Oscars and awards at Cannes with his brother Joel, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two filmmakers who were fans of folk music built their story on real figures of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the advent of Greenwich Village, this New York district destined to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would give birth to international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk wrote.
The film then takes on the look of a documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by 33T unsold inhabited by an old unpaid secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The Coen brothers' magic still operates with a strange character that runs through the film all the time: a gorgeous, red-eyed, creepy-eyed cat, Llewyn Davis's lucky companion.
When asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled "growing up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar", he added.
For Justin Timberlake, while work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch one's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be trapped by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He's never heard of retiring.
The French publishing phenomenon Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th book, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, The New York Times hailed him as "the author of the spy novel who knew too much".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the setting for the 198th and 199th installments of the famous spy novel series.
Physically disabled by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling on a walker during this trip.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, claimed to be unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million in all countries", he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his lap, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not to mention the pirate editions", he added, pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table among the bronzes or ivory brought from 130 countries, which he had scraped to fit his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with a picture of a young woman with a powerful chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and CIA contracted agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, goes after all the bad guys of the world, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
Every book, the same recipe: a big dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary author", explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't text.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, the Albert London type, who went out and came back with real, long investigations".
The father of SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I am constantly following up my files (Afghanistan, Syria, etc.) before leaving", added Gérard de Villiers.
I meet journalists there, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for 20 or 30 years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often prescient: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several high-ranking officials, he told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In "The Fools of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the bombing.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he described the columns of 4×4 jihadists that surrounded the Malian capital.
I am not a fortune teller, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make hypotheses from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM typewriter with margarita "all the parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected every page with a pen.
On the walls of his office are AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly accused of machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers rejected these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent, brave women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have a very large readership.
Gérard de Villiers said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die, nor will he retire.
No more than I do.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel over seat width as big orders are at stake
The dispute between the major aircraft manufacturers over the width of the economy class seats on long-haul flights is raging, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to passengers in economy class  which are not always the most frequently used by airlines, but for which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the airline industry to set a standard of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) seat size in economy class, but its major US rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute has erupted as aircraft manufacturers are looking to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, hoping to eventually record orders at the event, which runs from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft  in particular, will there be 9 or 10 seats at the front  is essential for the economic performance of the  mini-jumbo  segment.
states that its redesigned Boeing 777X will seat 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says its competing A350 will carry 350 passengers in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats arranged in rows of nine.
The giants of the aeronautics industry often exchange punches on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the lead over its competitors with over 100 orders.
We recently became aware of what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other in a restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?"
 Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft , said John Leahy, Airbus' commercial director.
As eating habits change, people get fatter, but seating on airplanes hasn't changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo jet defined the modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American age 40 to 49 gained 10 percent more weight, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The average American's waist is 39.7 inches in the 21st century, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the newly named aircraft  jet set  was narrower in circumference.
Airbus says it commissioned a study that showed that an extra inch in the width of the seats would improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures for seat width and says it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and amenities.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
 It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to run their business successfully, said Kent Craver, head of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
The dispute is a race for control of aircraft worth an estimated at least $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat configurations are exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Both Boeing and Boeing claim a 20% higher seat-per-seat efficiency in their latest twin-engine long-haul models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance advertised by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is small compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this to be able to fit more seats and make its planes more competitive in relation to our products", said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial standpoint, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777", said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines have to choose.
Aircraft salesmen who travel the world even take a meter with them to check out competing configurations.
While all manufacturers claim to offer comfortable aircraft, they also offer aircraft with high-density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasised the need for greater cabin personalisation by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its appeal to the airline industry to set up a standard seat size will succeed, but it could wipe out the 777X sales surge.
Oracle shareholders pissed off by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposed compensation for founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the company's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but it does tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, third richest man in the world just after his boat won the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software company he co-founded 40 years ago.
Ellison was already voted down last year on his compensation.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year that ended in May because of the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he received about $77 million in stock-options related bonuses.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the full year 2013, Oracle's net profit rose by 3.5% while the stock market price rose by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P 500 Index which gained 24% in the same time.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could take away the fun of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from lifelong nicotine addiction.
More tests are needed before human trials can begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting every method available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information necessary to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies target any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus preventing the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
In tests, vaccinated mice that were then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated  were appeased , the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous vaccines against tobacco have proven ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently to keep the antibody levels high that they were too costly and inconvenient.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing any nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
 They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this can help them to lose their bad habit , he added.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but pointed out that much more research was needed.
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security officials said.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been reported several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist officials said this time that he was killed in the strike, which took place in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike", said a senior security official.
The day before, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a visit to London, informed the British Government that talks had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid pressured several ministers of state to renew his leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a café, after they expired in August 2005 without a call for tender.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr Tripodi's former deputy secretary general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressed for the leases to be put up for tender.
The tenants were against it and wanted longer periods as well.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which brought the Obeids about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any tenders.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, was demanding a change in the government's policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior civil servant who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
"Was the topic of discussion during these phone calls the development of the policy on commercial leases?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.
 No , said Mr Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes are targeting Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia late Thursday, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official didn't specify who the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may be required to pass an authenticity test 
The government is currently studying the possibility of introducing an authenticity test for foreign workers holding a 457 visa as it plans to expand the crackdown.
The test, if passed, would be applied under a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to fill unqualified positions or as a roundabout way to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labor MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
 The blunt statements about "foreigners going back to the back of the line" and "Australian jobs first" are an unpleasant throwback to the days when unions were calling for a protected labour market, she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor had to be protected  and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working paper lists the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the changes recommended, with the others under review.
If the  authenticity  criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for  whether the job offer is genuine if the applicant is a relation or personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring enterprise .
Companies may also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employ hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's frightened nine-year-old son was travelling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would bring the UK together.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to be working with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will be a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June the Government raised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to consider increasing rail capacity and improving journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities together".
We are pushing for HS2 because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a capacity problem on our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major cities in Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
The UK Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added:  Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. 
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support  unequivocally  the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland into the overall project of a high-speed rail network throughout Britain.
 We are therefore excited to be working in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring the high speed rail network to Scotland, creating a win-win and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
 I look forward to reading the review report with the UK ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps. 
Rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the move by the United States to relax regulations on electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases as long as they are in  plane  mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they can't access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision which requires US carriers to do a lot of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
 CASA has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , she said.
The issue is regulated by a regulation which requires aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which had already told CASA of its intention to expand the use of its Wi-Fi-enabled in-flight entertainment system, was open to change, but said it would follow the regulator.
 We would welcome a CASA revision that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft , a spokesperson said.
Qantas stated that it was complying with the current rules.
 Under our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change this,  she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will be looking closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, and review manuals, training materials, hand baggage schedules and passenger instructions.
 Once an airline has verified its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes , the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be stored safely under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent brawl
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual fever Thursday night.
Three police cars, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween, the evening was heated on the Pia side where a brawl involving several people broke out on the Post side.
At least four minor injuries would be deplorable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's pawnbrokers are taking advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer Mall, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' school fees.
 My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it , says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 (US$2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, such is the demand in parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became the third mortgage company to be listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Getting jewelry pawned is not only a quick way to get cash - $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singaporean mortgage lenders charge an annual effective interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and can unblock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to mortgage lenders as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and household and consumer over-indebtedness.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income households are turning to mortgage lenders to make up the difference as their economies slow.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, stemming mainly from higher mortgage rates, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt/gross domestic product ratios in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
 The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle and bottom [of the wage ladder] are looking to supplement their income as much as they can says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high gold prices of the past two years have caused people to rush to pawn their personal belongings to get the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pawned in the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say, "Gold is expensive, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month".
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The rise in the pawn shop sector is such that ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer store and 15 other similar stores in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia  where it already has four stores  but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them using 60 percent of the $66 million Singaporean it raised this week from its IPO.
While some low-interest lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that not only does pledge lending offer lower rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase debt.
 Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetising their personal property does not increase household debt, she says.
Mortgages are becoming more socially acceptable as a means of securing short-term secured financing.
And people who go to mortgage lenders are not just people who have money problems.
Wealthy Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pawn shops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60 percent of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
 They can be wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term for business activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to get through a difficult time , adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who worked with youths in Halifax, Nova Scotia, is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following raids on his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist Church in Timberlay, where the pastor served, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his position.
The pastor was released on parole.
This includes not communicating with anyone under 18 and not accessing the Internet.
He's due in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes to the supermarket in a Nazi uniform, and then he gets kicked out.
A man in a Nazi uniform with a swastika-embossed armband was asked to leave a British supermarket after customers complained to the store's management, who called the police, the store said Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store", a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket chain explained.
The store called the police for help, but "by the time they arrived, he had already left without a scandal", she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were amazed.
"You don't go out in the street like this unless you want to attract attention", a client, Rosina Rusin, 60, told the Cambridge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda", said Paul Dutton, who said he had "mental problems".
A $325 million rescue plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the failing health system comes with strict conditions designed to ensure that the state government will not squander the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking urgent action to end a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic disease and systemic constraints.
The funding, which is for four years, was decided after consultations between the government and the Tasmanian Independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
 The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state , Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help to catch up.
Funding is also being provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved outpatient care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
 These investments are in response to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system,  said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian Government would face a strict regime of reporting and accountability.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it is spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services in the most efficient and effective manner.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not mean much unless it is followed by real reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system.
He nevertheless commended the government for responding to the request for urgent aid he had made to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
 I hope the federal aid plan will go a long way in removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist, said Mr Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "call of the wild".
"The reason we are here is because the state Labour government has taken $430 million out of its health system", he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government pulling in almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in $300 million, and pretend it's a big day.
Mr. Dutton visited Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout will be spent on additional red tape.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and meticulous reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the unlimited cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never gets into the sensuality or the sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed equipment critical to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A Syrian militant group also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day ahead of the deadline for the
The Hague-based organization set out on 1 November its orders to Damascus to destroy or render unusable all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is a significant step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have around 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which tracks the death toll through a network of militants based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of which 18,678 were pro-government forces and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people have fled the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting has highlighted the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid a continuing civil war, with tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was "now satisfied that all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling" had been "controlled" and "destroyed".
It added that  no further inspection activities were planned at this time .
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria,  abandoned and... that the chemical weapons program elements they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected .
It was difficult to tell at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
 I commend the moral strength and courage you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization , said the organization's Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war pits mostly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and security forces, who are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there was a large explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger over sentence for one of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angrily to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Omar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly a decade on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released on parole after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass murder for the bombings of two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
He was also convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence, but they could have asked for the man, known as  Demolition Man  for his reputation as an expert in bomb-making, to be sentenced to death.
The decision brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly a decade ago.
She said, tearfully, that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
 He should be dragged before the firing squad , Ms Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the bombing and was unconscious for a month, and he died three times while on life support.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have met the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre  Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra  who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death first.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He managed to evade capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
 He did not go , added Ms Corteen.
Until recently, he was a big fan of the pain he caused other people.
The verdict was handed down on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year with ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year", said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can appeal his conviction, though.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cell phones - under highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and aircraft stowage rules to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
Depending on the plan, we may approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They're not supposed to turn them on until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices when descending from the plane before landing and not turn them on again until the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines with aircraft properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and ground handling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy about the changes.
"Once the new policy is safely implemented and we will work closely with the carriers to make it work, it will be profitable for everyone", Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like  hall controllers when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be required to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly ejected from an American Airlines flight after refusing to turn off his device while it was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will always need to be stowed away because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones will also continue to be prohibited on board.
The regulatory power regarding cell phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national expert on transportation safety, said on CBS News that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, from the FCC, that they could disrupt cell phone relay antennas if used on board", Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the problem recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to loosen restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming more difficult to enforce as the use of the devices has become pervasive.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the day.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also have better resistance to interference.
The vast majority of airliners should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But the transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on passenger use of electronic devices.
In 2011, the company executives loaded a plane with Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA advisory committee with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the aircraft presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
One travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for technology-enabled travelers.
 We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety , said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird hoisted from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helicopter-ridden after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water raft was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being refurbished by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
The centre's director, Colin Seddon, said: "This water raft was probably a wintering migrant from northern Europe and was caught in the North Sea's strong winds".
It appears the exhausted bird has managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added:  He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help. 
The water rack was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and expanding while EU states stagnate.
They want the government to prioritise new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues - ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws - the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area  40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more significantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a significant majority wanted to see Britain continue the initiatives in favour of treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This finding, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is insisting on significant change that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high  succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would see a swing of 16 per cent of votes in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British businesses support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
It also shows that businesses hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of UK businesses as the euro area embarks on the path towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as our survey findings show, for businesses this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
The United States in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the Halloween tradition.
He and his wife, last night, distributed treats to hundreds of children who were invited to the White House grounds in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the East Coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the party people have caught up.
In New York City, thousands of people in costumes participated in the parade held in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
"Everyone is over-excited", says one of the participants, Andrea.
I finally got to put on the costume I planned for last year.
"We're having a great time", Rhonda added.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints' Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the Bulgarian pipeline is opening a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom CEO said.
 A historic event took place today: Construction has started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project , Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of the European continent.
South Stream should diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, through which most of Russia's gas to Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction to EU member Bulgaria means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated  forever .
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn is planning to create the world's largest marine reserve, the Tahiti News reported Thursday, quoting Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory covers 47 square kilometres, including three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its 1790 occupation by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen residents, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live on Pitcairn, and their income is 95 percent dependent on the generosity of London.
The Island Council voted unanimously to create a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which is 836,000 km2 and which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to approve the request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step toward greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to protect these 836 000 km2 provided, however, that it has the means to monitor them, which it does not.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more planes dedicated to the area's surveillance, and there is no port to station military surveillance ships.
France is already carrying out the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million square kilometres of the EEZ of French Polynesia, which is adjacent to Pitcairn.
The FAA is relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic devices on board aircraft  but calls to mobile phones will still be prohibited.

Life in prison for former Chinese vice governor
A former vice governor of China's northeastern Jilin province was sentenced on Friday to life in prison for corruption.
Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of accepting more than 19 million yuan in bribes, Chinese state media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the chairman of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's First Intermediate Court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying it poses a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
While the head of state promised that justice would be as tough with the powerful "tigers" as it was with the "flies" - the junior civil servants - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest office in the state.
But the government has shown no intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent body from the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord during a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were charged with child sexual assault following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 during a hearing of the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had never had to deal with a child sexual abuse problem within its organisation.
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA physical education instructor Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexually assaulting children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel for the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but not the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by pointing out,  External audits of the YMCA were done and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization. 
It was shown to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments out of four schools in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit carried out in August of that year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violation of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the idea that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings toward child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some failings, including Lord being alone with the children, keeping them in private, having them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was being tutored by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said she found the child services manager at the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who tutored Lord, "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The general manager said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these failures to their superiors.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment, so they didn't report his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his view before the New South Wales YMCA board that for the organisation the lesson from the Jonathan Lord incident should not concern staff reporting, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were brought to light was made by YMCA's chief executive officer for child services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an  overzealous  and had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University to the Commission.
He indicated that there were 'serious problems' in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his views on various national policies known.
Since leaving office in June 2007 after a decade in power, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Quartet special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to be Prime Minister again, Mr Blair is reported to have replied, according to the London Evening Standard:  Yes, of course, but it is likely to happen, so... 
When many of the world's equestrian experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be fierce.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old boy, to win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted through all three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable  who are the same size  were praised for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition which took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing up to men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat a little to the side in a casual way to parade his 2-year-old pony Toffee around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural training qualities uncommon for a child of his age.
And Toffee got very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been training with his Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee make a great duo".
They stood up to everyone, but both of them took the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he'd raced with Toffee and we were all thrilled that he had won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The young boy, from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in equestrian events for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said:  There was electricity in the air and everyone cheered and applauded her. 
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be tiny, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is an animal lover - he loves horses, tractors and the countryside and has two chickens to look after.
The way he's started, he'll probably be in the Horse of the Year contest soon and I'm sure he'll put on a good show.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said:  Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to ride his pony. 
They make a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They're looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer. Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his nice clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud looking.
Chinese newspaper calls for change
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be overhauled, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company.
Now the New Express will undergo a "complete overhaul", the regulator said.
The order for the "reworking" comes from the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
 New Express's editorial staff was disorganized , the regulator said in a statement.
He said that he had decided to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.
He also ordered Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the people responsible at New Express and immediately overhaul the newspaper's management team.
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page call for his release, writing that it supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a public television station where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
 In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust , he told CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published an apology on its front page, saying that it had not properly verified its articles.
Several high-profile suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically coerced into giving confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year banning authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is "not available"
The carrier is in the air at Toulon.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of the two nuclear boilers of the Charles de Gaulle in mid-October while the ship was at sea was "safe for the sailors", but it has consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has just confirmed that the ship will be "not available" until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
The Commission has also decided to extend the scope of the programme to include the following areas:
One of the tasks they have to do is to change a pump on the damaged boiler.
"Everything is being done to ensure that the Charles de Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013", explains DCNS.
And the Navy certifies that "this does not in any way call into question the ship's nuclear-powered program of activity".
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is just coming out of a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for a training exercise.
This was done in particular to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small accident", confined to the reactor containment area, had occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
The Navy has determined that the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For over a year now, I have been able to see the discontent of the people I meet everywhere: the monstrous re-evaluation of their properties, the flood of taxes, the cost of all kinds of permits, the endless administrative expenses.
In short, a limitless drain on our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved to allow for taxation that is very respectful of those who pay.
Any money that is taken from taxpayers by force diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, there is no shortage of health care and maintenance expenses for the lame ducks: a loss-making cultural center, a large subsidy to the Energy City, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they should be sold to private companies or demolished.
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties to accommodate a major industry that never came.
I do, however, give a fair mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?
It is not the public sector that invests in such enterprises, but the private sector, based on consumer demand.
The citizens were happy to learn that the lakes at La Pêche and des Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (which are major consumers of water) and the great decline in population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the country.
Not to say that it is wasted, the city will never run out of water, and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly relaxed.
In short, it's easy to do great things with other people's money.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city can't even afford to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by men with ties and mostly good degrees and I don't think a sheep farmer could do worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug tunnels between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation, and electrical systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The zigzag tunnel, which is nearly six football fields long, connects the warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, California, U.S.A.
The area is full of warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs could get out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men, who authorities said were working as chauffeurs, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence of 10 years to life if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers are exploiting vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to drug cartels that need to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard railroad tunnel that stretched from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue an extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a remission notice to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be liable to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden over allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, seeking political asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard  issued a remission notice to a 40-year-old man asking him to report to a police station on a date and time of his choosing , a spokesman said.
He's still violating the terms of his parole.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears extradition from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after he leaked more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, a website fighting against classified information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to access her smartphone or pay for her groceries?
Researchers in the United States, France and Japan predict a future in which we will be recognized by biometric sensors in phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a transversal and transnational universe such as the Internet.
Privacy organizations acknowledge this biometric craze, but are concerned.
In 2011 alone, the French National Commission for Information and Freedoms approved 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, hand shapes or hand veins in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime", says Justin Brookman, consumer privacy officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism in some and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will be based on new technologies, which will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, the most widely used biometric data in France are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the network of veins of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
"For example, some concrete workers have very badly damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible", says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity area at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and the verification of the network of veins and the contour of the hand assume a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - you cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches, such as face recognition and iris (the colored part of the eye).
With the increase in the precision of sensors and the computational power of computers needed to analyze data, these techniques are becoming operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold in the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automated border crossings using facial recognition.
It's now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we are doing research on speech recognition or gait recognition using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment", says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
As a unique and unmistakable marker, DNA also raises hopes and worries.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and prospects at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very time-consuming and very expensive.
NEC is offering the police a suitcase worth 90,000 euros to analyse DNA samples at the scene of a crime in one hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who he claims to be).
The identification process has so far involved the issuing of identity papers: biometric data (fingerprints, photograph, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to impersonate another.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
"We retrieve the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet", explains Dany Nassif, responsible, at NEC France, for commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Other uses include taking a picture of a quidam standing in a queue in a store, tracking its progress through facial recognition and calculating the waiting time.
Authentication originally concerned physical accesses (border, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical accesses (opening a computer).
More recently, attendance control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a friend pointing to another", explains Cyril Bataller of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also affect transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some ATMs by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader - this gesture replaces the secret code.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in stores with a credit card, the customer does not type in his code, but inserts his finger into a vein scanner.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon be available in French shops.
Some clues to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If biometrics can reduce a customer's time at the checkout by 30 seconds, that's a good thing", says the manager of a large store.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
Finally, reassure them by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which locks if you try to move it", says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, in the absence of extensive studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, however, continue to worry.
"The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras, and the sheer volume of photos available on Facebook, Flickr, and Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance", predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was fined £1,000
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 130 miles an hour with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 up Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be taken between his legs.
At the Colchester Magistrates Court, Howie admitted to the offence of driving without due care and attention.
The seven points removed from his license led to a six-month license revocation.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the London housing bubble
The Treasury has provisionally priced the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget included a 7% stamp duty on properties costing more than £2m and an annual fee for buyers who choose to hold properties as part of a company rather than as individuals.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and is £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, which is more than the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Following the increase in stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the Anti-avoidance Act, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are undertaxed independently of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system".
But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell, he added.
Luxury real estate - the top 5-10% of the property market - in the thriving southwest London area from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London have grown steadily year-on-year by 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by a growing domestic market, with the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have recently uncovered a link between the movements of a dog's tail and its mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog's perspective), while nervous dogs wagged their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.
Here, we tried to see what was happening in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals as they watched movies that featured other dogs.
They measured the animals' heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained:  We presented to dogs films with other dogs  either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor  and we were able to manipulate the movement of the tail and present it as going more to the left or right. 
When the animals saw an expressionless dog wagging its tail to the right (from the perspective of the dog wagging its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail that was mostly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate spiked and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not believe that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience which movements they should or should not worry about.
He added:  If you meet other dogs repeatedly and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to the side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience. 
The researchers say that the findings could help pet owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their pets' emotions.
Dog behaviourist John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Science, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog and to the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said:  Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was wagging left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious  the opposite of what was shown in the Italian study. 
He indicated that the differences may be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
 Although there is a lot of evidence in different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be worked out  and dogs are no exception , he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it probably won't take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed a Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys have postponed a concert in Glasgow after their frontman was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform at The Hydro concert hall downtown on Friday.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement was made after the band were forced to postpone a concert at Birmingham's LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the show at Birmingham's LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1st November".
 Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert. 
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the one at the Glasgow Hydro will be held on 21 November.
All tickets are still valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologise to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket office where you bought your ticket for further assistance.
Pope Francis will name his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and they elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope  so this amounts to a group of 120  cardinal electors .
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops are elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
 Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,  said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of electors to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a tendency to favour Europe and particularly Italy.
 It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , he added.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Before, the pope made his own decisions.
 Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , Valero explained.
He added that it was  quite possible  that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we have never experienced such a situation before. It is totally new.
Valero said that popes usually elevate bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises" so we don't know who he will appoint.
GM is recalling some of its new pickups in the U.S. to fix the seat backs.
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address a problem with manual-tilt folders, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a leaning mechanism defect.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for headrests.
 If the vehicle is hit from behind, the headrest may not protect the passengers properly, increasing the risk of injury , according to the statement posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The rollout of GM's pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the information letter to owners due to the 16-day government shutdown, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York stock exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks early Thursday in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred at about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
Evidently, work on the foundation had been going on for some time at this location.
A wall of adjoining foundation had been erected in the last days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve his tools.
"I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke", said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I went down and removed the big bricks that were covering it.
We could only see part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
Authorities say the victim is a middle-aged man who worked for a forging company.
Resuscitation attempts were made by the emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man did not survive his severe injuries.
An inspector from the Health and Safety at Work Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the accident.
The cry of despair from an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama's efforts are commendable, but thwarted by Republican obstructionism.
Obstructionism doesn't excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare website, nor the drone attacks
The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me through the gloom of my second year of medical school and give me hope.
It's called  The Audacity to Win  and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' medical reports at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and the news anchors took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was moving toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82 percent favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Coming back to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of past opportunities.
The change really happened in the years after I voted for the first time.
It was nothing like what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from passing the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our military from Iraq, to the end of the "never seen nor known" and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the areas of immigration reform, public health care and the closing of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration to my peers and colleagues, I can't come up with any explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
She can't explain the National Security Agency's collection of Americans' private data, or the indictment of whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the overspending during presidential campaigns.
She can't justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And, more recently, she can't excuse not being able to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if this is what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is unpredictable, because the opposition political party and random events, like the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that seemed to have no basis for his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected to a second term, free from the pressure of future elections, would deliver on the promises we've heard so much about for so long.
Yet, with the approval rating dropping below 45% this week, it's even harder to go back to 2008 in this book.
It makes me wish for the many promises that have flown by.
This week, I read the part of the book that described how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
 I want us to focus on our talent, he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr President, I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, at about 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on the Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The rider, 26-year-old Jonathan from Fleraun, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid response of emergency services, he died in the head-on collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Congressman Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest regarding the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of the system.
The mining tycoon, who is contesting the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has made this argument to try to avoid any questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
 He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave,  Mr Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.
Mr. Palmer has put forward the idea of a re-engineering of the counting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system", he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can log in, type your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the results at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is this so you can erase the result if someone disagrees?
These days, having a pencil and paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possible options for electronic voting and has recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties  very seriously .
The exercise of public office is a matter of public service.
 We are not looking for any reward, except the story award because we have to serve the community at a critical time , he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientist at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Life (OCEAMM), reports on this discovery for L'Express and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new species of humpbacked dolphin?
That's good news, but it doesn't surprise me much.
Whereas in the past species were described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of the science of species classification.
It is not impossible that advances in genetics and molecular biology will call into question the classification of species into a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are being challenged by advances in genetic science.
Similarly, two very morphologically related species have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case with the newly identified species.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily - the Pacific humpback dolphins and the Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this a significant discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has claimed?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
Although this population had been known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, found only in this area.
So if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or by accidental capture arises in the region, we may be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a species more widely distributed on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to re-establish itself from the neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there is a lot of genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
We'd rather send robots to Mars than find out what's living in the Marianas Trench, which is only seven miles below the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than we do on marine research, and it's time that changed.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division according to two sources familiar with the matter, once again showing that the global investigation by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in their investigations of the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expanded investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this matter is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators", a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said that RBS had passed files of emails and instant messages sent to and by a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of currency spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot currency trading at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file said.
UBS explained this week that it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspicions of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations that bankers colluded to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the matter said.
Banks have been sifting through instant messages and emails for years to find instances of wrongdoing.
News of these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year by low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the matter by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasing use of banks' own in-house platforms  explains why it is possible to start impacting the market at low cost .
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London-based exchange-traded fund office this week after he caused a $6 million loss late last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was brought under control", said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation was botched, says lawyer
After police confirmed they had a copy of the video showing Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby said he had never seen an investigation "so sloppy".
Ruby told me to believe the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and casual driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police also said they saw this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his phone, claiming that police chief Bill Blair made a conscious choice not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in person, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby's comments "an obvious and desperate attempt" to make a point to the media in a case that has nothing to do with him.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for bringing a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock markets down at mid-session, excluding London
With the exception of London, the major European stock markets are down on Friday mid-session, buoyed by some disappointing corporate news, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
Investors are also cautious, as they believe that the US Federal Reserve may unwind its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of a 0.7% inflation rate for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures are predicting an open for U.S. stocks, which are up after two consecutive downturns.
In terms of values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline in the CAC 40, led by the warning on the results of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) posted the worst performance on the EuroFirst300, after also posting lower results this morning and announcing the creation of an in-house "bad bank" with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) is still leading the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press report that AT&T is considering a possible takeover.
Speculation on the ECB's monetary policy is rife on the foreign exchange market, as Saxo Bank strategist John Hardy points out.
The ECB's single mandate has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
Against this background, the euro continued to decline against the US currency and reached a two-week low of $1.3517.
These same conjectures, on the other hand, support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court upholds Obama health care reform law
Big win for Obama administration: US Supreme Court today declared Obama's health care reform law was constitutional.
By a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, or face a fine, and declared it constitutional by virtue of the government's taxing power.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four most liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also upheld the other sections of the 2,700-page law and found that the provision in the Health Care Reform Act that states that the Medicaid eligibility threshold must be lowered or all federal funding for the program will be forfeited was constitutionally coercive.
The process to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primaries, including the nominee Mitt Romney, vehemently opposed the bill.
A vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the fallen of all wars on Friday afternoon.
Gherkins were placed in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinians and Israelis clash at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were injured on Thursday evening, October 31, 2013, in a violent standoff on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday, November 1 after running out of fuel, the Palestinian Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another Hamas armed wing official, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officers, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four militants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of about 100 meters into the territory before withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted for half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said that Israeli soldiers were killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier in Khan Younes.
Several enemy soldiers were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier", the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the tunnels were used to fight Israel, saying the purpose was to kidnap Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement explained.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting the IDF forces and wounding 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians", said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also struck a military air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a missile cargo destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported Thursday, October 31.
A US official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details on the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah", he said.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" it did not name, the Saudi-funded channel said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles that were destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, was unable to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Danse Danse: the first inspired by the ink and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos of Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole Chouinard prism, from art to tics and from black to ink to white.
A white screen serves as a backdrop.
On the carpet, as white as the vast space of the Théâtre Maisonneuve, a body appears, thin as a line and dressed in black.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a mere feature, takes its form.
And that shape will be the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, all dressed in black, only their hands and faces uncovered, wait on either side of the playing field, rush in when the next graffiti appears, embody it, run out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relay of solos, in a group in unison (a mass that is solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each one performs his sign.
We think of "Morning Glory", where, solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed in a row in the foreground.
It's the same principle, giant version of PowerPoint.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm is still fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monotone and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to start again, and the sequence to resume.
This energetic, loud, and long-lasting burst of sound eventually deafens and numbs.
So does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a strength of Chouinard - like these hair that blur or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed itself, with its tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider and more exuberant imagination than the dance, more porous.
Only the ending, in negative, with its dancers hacked by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in cloth, like furniture in a derelict house.
Dancers take turns playing the piano.
Their musical awkwardness, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in couples in love, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, little solo transitions, moving ensembles, choirs, the writing is less binary.
The clowns, as familiar to Chouinard, appear, sporting the red nose, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Lovers are carnivorous, fugitive or playful.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridiculousness of the bodies into coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the play takes off after the rescue.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
Everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers go to the floor, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, go around, play the codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated mess that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are sweating, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began a spate of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it took over at the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow for displaying advertising related to Internet search terms, the lawsuit found, which is Google's core business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not able to be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the patents of Nortel.
Google increased its bid several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel's patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal based in part on Motorola's patent library.
 Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at auction, it has infringed and continues to infringe the patents , the court findings said.
Rockstar is seeking more substantial damages against Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater caused the explosion
The grandmother lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion in a house in Gesves, which left two people seriously injured on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, was due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, the deputy prosecutor of the King said on Friday evening.
The expert sent by the prosecutor assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
Both victims are still in critical condition.
The grandmother was thrown out by the explosion and is badly burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was beside him and was slightly burned.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time before being taken to the Liège hospital, she by helicopter, he by ambulance", said Mayor José Paulet, who went to the scene.
The grandfather was upstairs in the explosion.
He was able to reach the ground floor safely by the staircase, which remained intact, while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, which was weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The fire brigade of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches have intervened.
Crysne's Civil Defence has stabilized both vessels.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has been sworn in as president, but it is unlikely that his triumph will mark the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the presidential oath, becoming the first freely elected president to succeed Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 black-robed judges of the court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
 We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic, President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television.
 Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life  absolute freedom, true democracy and stability , said Mr Morsi, a 60-year-old US-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for more than 84 years since its formation was considered an illegal organization and was severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, unlike the presidential splendour of Mubarak's years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Regarded as the uncharismatic "spin-wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has been greatly enhanced since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started in the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", said Mohamed Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges in the wood-carved hall where he took the oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by a military band that played the national anthem as he got on his guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
On his arrival, he was greeted by the chant  The people and the army, hand in hand... chanted by thousands of people gathered in the university's main amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and a former stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and vowed to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, deposed him from.
But by agreeing to take the oath officially before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bowed to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The US shutdown has slowed down the car market growth
The 16-day shutdown of most federal offices weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, figures released Friday by automakers show, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
All three of Detroit's major automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million sales at an annualized rate and adjusted for seasonal variations but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's clients, he believes that this slight setback is primarily due to "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month".
GM nonetheless reported a nearly 16% increase in its sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, against the consensus's expectation of 211,563.
The four brands of the group improved their sales performance compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickup trucks, among others, saw its sales increase by 14% year on year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was for 194,301.
Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared with the expected 143 536.
Toyota and Nissan also posted lower sales than the consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM stock was up 1.4% at 4.35pm GMT while Ford was down 1.1%.
Renault plunged in the stock market by the warning of Nissan
Renault's SBF 120 index fell sharply in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had cut its net annual profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders reported.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reorganisation of its management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
"It's clearly the profit warning of Nissan", said a trading manager at a Paris brokerage.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French one, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near a neo-Nazi party building
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots fired by two people on a motorcycle that passed a Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not able to provide any information about the identity of the victims or their political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn claimed the victims were guards of their club.
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorism unit rushed to the central avenue in the suburban area of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place, and sealed off the area.
The incident comes a few weeks after six MPs from Golden Dawn, including the leader and founder of the party, were charged with participating in "a criminal organisation" in an offensive against the party launched after the death of an antifascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has had his appeal dismissed and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
The Scottish midfielder, who was sent off against Barça for striking Neymar, has been suspended for three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households across the province were without power shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15 042 subscribers plunged in the black, the Montérégie with 13 464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal area also has its share of blackouts with nearly 7,000 homes without electricity in the city and in Laval.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Center seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has raised its net profit forecast and is expecting record results from holidaymakers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the full year of between $325 and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current projections are met, this will represent 12 to 17 percent growth from the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/12.
General Manager Graham Turner said Flight Centre had achieved 8% profit in the first half and the second half had started strong, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
 Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the whole year before interest and tax deduction, he said.
This is true of Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the most profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel business has performed well while business customers have spent less.
Its US subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year, when seasonal demand was lower, and was expected to make a profit for the full year for the third consecutive year.
Flight Center shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns firing on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo
Unknown masked gunmen opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt, but no one was killed, apparently as a result of a dispute with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, police General Abdel Latif.
The attack comes at a time when Egypt has been almost completely deprived of tourists since the military ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and is cracking down on protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the English literature course, students will be required to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce new texts to encourage a wider range of reading.
A combined English and literature course will be eliminated.
From 2015, students will be required to take an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English Literature.
The Department of Education is due to publish its new English and math curricula tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
The new system will also be based on a new system of grades and less courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a "broad consensus" about the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, insisting that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singaporean students have about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the comprehensive GCSE in maths  as well as the greater importance given to subjects in international rankings  would likely encourage schools to devote more time to classroom instruction.
The programme will focus more on  real-world problems , including financial mathematics.
The ruling means that a law passed in July in the state that largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to take effect.
An octogenarian welcomes kids with a rifle to the Muy for Halloween
The minors, ages 9 and 13, were going door to door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the Muy residents the children had visited opened the door with his shotgun.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His gun was confiscated.
Former Gestapo chief buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II and was never found, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte", he told the daily in a wide circulation, relying on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would answer one of the great puzzles of the postwar era.
The German secret service, the BND, claimed that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was completely wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a makeshift grave near the former Reich Ministry of Aviation by a commando", according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general's uniform".
"In the left inner pocket were his service records and a photograph", he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the borough council of Berlin's Mitte district indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the borough.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, expressed shock at this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists should be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is being crudely trampled underfoot", the newspaper protested.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who was never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Pamela Anderson is cutting off her iconic blonde hair and adopting a spectacular girlie haircut.
Pamela's blonde curls became famous thanks to her role in the TV series Alert in Malibu.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock her fans with a spectacular new hairstyle.
The old hottie from Alert in Malibu dropped her long blond hair for a platinum blonde girly haircut.
The 46-year-old actress unveiled her new look while walking in L.A. on Wednesday and shared a photo on her Twitter page.
This is the first time in 20 years that the pretty blonde got her hair cut, and we're all fans of the subtle change.
What do you think of Pammy's haircut?

Dr. George Bwelle provides free health care in villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely one for every 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the year 2013.
You can vote for him, or any of the other 10 heroes, to be voted  CNN Hero of the Year .
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visit hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would haunt him for the rest of his life.
 There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, getting him any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy", says Mr Bwelle.
You can leave your house at 5:00, you can run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die waiting too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the United States has a ratio of 1 doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's healthcare expenditure is in the private sector.
 The only problem they have is poverty , Dr Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of events.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 free surgeries in the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he started a nonprofit humanitarian organization, ASCOVIME, that goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with some 30 people, they crammed into vans with medical equipment on the roof and crossed difficult terrain to reach the villages that needed the most help.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
Many times they had to push the vehicles across rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed like heroes: the community throws a party, sings and dances, and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free healthcare is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle  with his big smile and overflowing energy  is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
 We receive 500 people for each visit , said Mr Bwelle.
They live 40 miles from the village, and they come on foot.
In this mobile hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches, a pair of prescription glasses or a free birth certificate - a necessary document to go to school - but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, a town hall or a home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to give his place to the next person.
With the generator lighting, operating theatre lighting, and equipment sterilization, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a grueling rhythm, but the village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
 They beat drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working , Mr Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they've done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their presence can make a difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he had to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and my family's future", the man said.
In addition to running this mobile hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This second job, he explains, finances 60 percent of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to raise money for his charity so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it's a learning opportunity on the ground that they don't have at home.
 We were able to participate in operations to help swab the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle , Ms. O'Malley explained.
This is not something you get a chance to do in America when you're a second-year medical student.
Student volunteers usually pay for their own journey to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical supplies.
But once in Yaoundé, their board, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He is a hero, there is no doubt about it", said Katie O'Malley.
He has given his life to this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not going to die.
Dr Bwelle does not find the relatively constant workload a problem.
Helping others to live a happy life in fulfillment of the promise he made to his Father is something that brings him immense joy.
 I am so happy when I do this job , added Mr Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons I do this.

The Two French by Pierre Nora
Puzzled, scholars have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in theaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but by emphasising its weakness for cross-roads, sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrating other people's work in his office on Rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Yes, but ignoring the editor's underground work and writing.
Heir to Fontenelle's chair at the French Academy?
Yes, but knowing that such a sacrament cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which he has passed.
They readily recognized him as a great inspirer, animator and unifier of their works, but pointed out that he showed little inclination to produce them himself.
The monument to the "Lions of Memory", to which he gave his name, also contributed to this uncertain image.
The bad tongues have seen a gigantic flea market, presented by a clever commentator, with a sharp eye and a sharp erudition, but incurably dilettante.
The two books Nora published almost two years ago have already established that whoever was not writing had written a lot and well.
This book should do him a great deal of justice.
Yet there is once again the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual wandering, jubilation jumping from one subject to another.
But it soon becomes clear that the disparate objects collected in this book, so beautifully titled, bring the brocanteur back to a single passion: that of discovering the constitutive knot of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of the time.
Here we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory mind of our leaders of the day, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is after is different.
He does not claim to inherit eternal freedom, he refuses to accept the definition.
Anxious at a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a puzzle-like object, tormented by irritating questions.
The question, which arises from the enterprise itself, is why, in a country so firmly established within its borders, so long ago timbered and solidly built, are we hearing these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, to ward off the turmoil born of the discords of French history.
The French and Gauls, the Armagnacs and the Burgundians, the Catholics and the Protestants, the forces of division here are very old.
And the most iconic is obviously the one that splits the national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but could not deny it; on the contrary, it was anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility because it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing beats the four steps outside the Hexagon, so Pierre Nora's American getaway could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France both made a revolution, wrote a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American cousinage is just a better way of emphasizing what's unique about us.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, the men are overwhelmed by the old indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
It's a consensual revolution when here it's sowing drama and confit.
There are founding fathers who are always honored, and here are revolutionary forefathers whose role models are hard to make, and who have killed each other.
There is an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as well as so many errors to catch up and attempts to recover.
France is leaving, France is coming
There was a time, however, when the French believed they could sew together the torn robe of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness in this central and creative moment of the Third Republic: he greeted those who were then working to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared the modern France and proposing a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity was only for a time.
Here it is again in dispute, shaken by a new kind of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of France as it passes away and a circumspect sketch of France as it comes.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should hold a few surprises.
We found out the chimney was a house.
The man of multiple curiosities was turning, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The slough-walker was standing in the center of the center.
And the man who had presented, more than half a century ago, a paper on the idea of nation, but had avoided the initial exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have finished it.
In a less rigid, more fractured and subtler form, of course.
But make no mistake, it is equally compelling.
For far more than the figure imposed by the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Otages du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for the hostages to complain and to bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
After being held for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqim (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical checks at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been reunited with their families.
And try to get back to normal life.
The New Observer interviewed Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former senior reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
The night you were released, you were on the set of the 8 o'clock news on "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In Beirut, for example.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free", but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're also very tense.
It's war, and the people who run us are very tense, too.
They're dropping us off on the side of the road.
There are Syrian military.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
French people are taking us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means of evacuating to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We arrive by helicopter, board a private plane, and return to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua gets on.
How did you arrive on French soil?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little rough.
There's an incredible rush.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three TV stations.
I come back and there's a lot of them.
The descent down the flight of stairs, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my house, many motorcycles follow our car, which Roussin drives.
The bikers are busy taking pictures and following me to my house where I have to do a bit of policing to keep some people out.
The media pressure is enormous.
It's not over, and we're in a better place to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so great that it's difficult to see clearly.
You come out of a hole and suddenly you're in the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to deal with.
But we did the hard part.
The same night, I'm on the 8 o'clock, the next day I'm on TV.
Then begins a sort of readjustment to life, very gently, for a month or two that is a bit like a holiday.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go ?
I had my first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at the Valley of Grace in the days after my return: X-rays, examinations of all kinds and a meeting with a psychiatrist.
It's not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the process.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
It made sense.
I didn't mind that.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what's being said.
The debate on ransom payments is one of them.
Some things make me mad, some things don't.
I try to sort things out between questions about my past as a hostage and my cap as president of the World Oats Association which allows me to put some distance, and seems much more interesting to address.
I'm wondering, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting with others for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a problem with the semantics.
It is necessary to define hostage-taking as 'political' hostage-taking - which is the case most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in sympathy, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might have access to justice, too?
A court in The Hague is for that.
Why not tell the hostage-takers, "You have violated the rules of war, as all the Geneva Conventions do, and we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me to be well-founded, legitimate, and common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the streets to protest against the trial of Morsi
Anger is building in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi is due to begin, they took to the streets.
A mobilisation across Egypt to demand the return of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, this Muslim Brotherhood activist stresses.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet with him, and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case file.
This isn't a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a fake trial, a pro-Morsi insurgency, he's the one who is supposed to put Sisi on trial, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense ID and the benefits that come with it", the minister said in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he said, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defense said he has ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of federal law.
The nine-state fray began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard installations, due to a conflict between Texas law and federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the same-sex marriage bill to be about 5,600 active duty personnel, including 17,000 in the National Guard, the Reserves and retirees.
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration will be held on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying rounds will begin at 10 a.m. before the final at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, such as the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place this year at the European Championships in Copenhagen and he loves nothing more than showing off to competitors who are three heads above him.
Toronto mayor's chasing reporters who came to question him on a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of using drugs, according to several media reports.
A video released to the authorities seems to support these suspicions.
The defendant, Rob Ford, has always denied ever having used crack, while admitting to having a penchant for cannabis.
This Thursday, he kicked out of his property several reporters who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images don't need any explanation or commentary.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, clearly of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and treat people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive", the ministries of health and agriculture said.
"Five people who had contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the animal carrier but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective", the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on anyone who has been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin that has been damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"As France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or its mother was imported from another country, not free", the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded case of "indigenous" rabies was in December 1998 in a fox and that "France was declared officially free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies in a female dog illegally imported from The Gambia was reported in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time", the ministries reminded, and it is transmissible for up to 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backs up his health care reform
Amid a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday reiterated his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you're happy with your health care, you can keep it".
After hundreds of thousands of people received termination notices from their providers, Republicans have been criticizing the president in recent days for deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
 The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it , he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a stir in the news" about terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-designed health plans for the same price or even less than they had anticipated.
"You will come out a winner", he declared.
The administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who buy their own insurance were forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
'Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,' said Kathleen Sebelius in her testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed  woefully .
 I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone , she added.
I can't wait to regain your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, when she thought her microphone was off, to an aide sitting behind her in yesterday's House session following a contentious exchange of views with Missouri Republican Representative Billy Long over whether she should sign on to Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long persistently asked Ms. Sebelius why the architect of the Affordable Care Act hadn't voluntarily forsaken government-sponsored insurance to sign up for a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now sells to millions of Americans.
Vettel wearing a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while incorporating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
German four-time Formula One World Champion Sebastian Vettel wore a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for the free practice session of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday.
Vettel chose from among 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and so can see the German champion up close, on the track and in his booth.
Vettel was supposed to wear that helmet on Friday and Saturday, when he was testing.
It's likely that he'll have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, meant to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
Aubervillians is launching a party for the suburbs
Let's not get this wrong.
In the spirit of its founder, Abdel-Malik Djermoune, the "suburban party" is not just for the suburban dwellers.
I chose a map of France as my logo, he explains.
When I speak of the suburbs, I am referring to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his native town of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, the great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighborhoods above all.
My number one proposal is to create a ministry for multiculturalism, he said.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
He was a member of the French Socialist Party from 2002 to 2011 and then of the Dominique de Villepin party from 2010 to 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left, but if people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
I only speak to extremist parties.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme - which can be consulted on the Internet - on a number of themes that are supposed to appeal to suburban residents and young people in particular: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of building guard...
"For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be just", he acknowledges.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he has already seven head of list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support mails I have received since yesterday are not all from the suburbs", he says.
John Kerry has admitted, in an unprecedented move, that US intelligence has gone too far in an inappropriate way.
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the US defensive stance towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions the spying had gone too far in inappropriate ways.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had been operating on "automatic pilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities came to light.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: 'It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have been taking things on autopilot because we had the opportunity to do so, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 9/11.
He later became the first senior member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had gone too far, but insisted that the rights of everyone had not been violated.
He said:  In some cases it went too far in inappropriate ways. 
And the president is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he was now making a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel deceived.
I can assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added:  We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up. 
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented airplanes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we have been able to learn the facts in advance.
In the meantime, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the US, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of counter-terrorism organizations because of the sense of frustration that the National Security Agency's surveillance is generating.
 It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that the Europeans remain by our side in the mutual commitment to fight terrorism , said Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chair of the US Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger that NSA's programs have caused.
The press reports that the NSA has intercepted millions of communications in Europe, which has strained relations with some US allies, however the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations have included documents leaked by Snowden that claim the NSA intercepted data and communications from the cell phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state.
Director of Intelligence James Clapper justified the Allied spying by stating that it was necessary and common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be released in the coming days.
He said the route was still to be worked out.
Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, but also to demonstrate  affectionate firmness.
He said that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they themselves have been applying for years.
 We can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world spying,  said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the resentment over US policies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed lower on Thursday, plunged by the poor results of Shell and the day after the Fed announced that it would maintain its support for the economy, as expected.
Australian woman appeals from prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming that she was assaulted by a taxi driver, has appealed the verdict and been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of making false statements after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were holding her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the whole story.
She was held in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We have obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible", said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on holiday in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a sentence of up to two years in prison and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to repair its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to a acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came with RSCA cars
The French police have decided to impose strict rules regarding the match between Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht and Paris Saint-Germain scheduled for Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Brussels-Medi police area, said on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who wish to attend this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium", the spokeswoman said.
The same procedure will be followed for the return.
"If other supporters were planning to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has informed that measures have been taken to allow arrests or even surveillance", said Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what prompted a consultation last year with parents, pupils, teachers and education staff to consider ways to better integrate pupils who live in a cross-cultural environment.
The school board has just unveiled its vision for "Living Together in French".
The organisation Vision diversité has been visiting schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common ground that is not limited to the French language.
The neighborhood exploration, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they're from the tribe or from somewhere else.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they can identify with all of this", explains the president of Vision Diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school board.
"For example, on the transmission of Québec culture, the feeling of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we are experiencing, among the student clientele", he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has set up a research centre which will provide tools for teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation for managing a classroom in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different pedagogical strategies are what is really needed", she said.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
