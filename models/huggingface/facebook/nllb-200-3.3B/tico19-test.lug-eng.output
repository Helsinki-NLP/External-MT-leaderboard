The number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) is increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The number of new cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) reflects the similar patterns across the European Union and its trading partners in the United Kingdom, which shows that, although the COVID-19 epidemic is at different rates in different countries, it is growing at a rapid pace across the world.
Based on the situation in Italy, countries, hospitals and emergency rooms must increase their preparedness for the rising number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical attention, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the outbreak was caused by a coronavirus of unknown origin that is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The findings suggest that approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild infection, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without respiratory infection, and that most of these cases recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a serious illness requiring hospitalization while in 6% of cases it becomes a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for COVID-19 patients who have been vaccinated is approximately 4%.
In this study, we examined the increase in COVID-19 cases in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and European country (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current COVID-19 infection rates in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread to other regions and the behavior of COVID-19 epidemics in other regions follows that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance 2020 release of 5 March, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first COVID-19 cases in Europe according to WHO data.
In the EU/EEA, the first case was detected in France on 24 January 2020 in a patient from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and the date of the report, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The number of COVID-19 cases and people infected with COVID-19 is increasing
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, from official sources such as the Ministry of Public Health, WHO's national health offices and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 02:00 am.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK, and compare it to that in Italy.
As a method to calculate the number of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the number of COVID-19 cases reported over a 14-day period, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the number of new cases in each country as it is increasing on 15 March 2020 at 02:00 compared to Italy on 31 January/15 March.
COVID-19 behaviour in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The increase in the number of COVID-19 cases reported in the last 14 days in the EU/EEA and UK countries generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the number of new cases of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 March and reached a peak around 28 February 2020 (January).
This was due to a rapid increase in cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK had similar increases in COVID-19 cases (Feb.
Figure 2 shows the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 02:00 GMT, the EU/EEA and the UK's other 15 countries had a total number of cases equal to that of Italy reported 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our data shows that the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing at a rapid rate in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The current trend in the number of people infected with COVID-19 indicates that the problem is increasing at a rapid rate in all countries.
This remains the case even though countries have different health status, different criteria for determining whether a person is infected and different criteria for determining who is tested for COVID-19, including an increase in the number of tests.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy described the situation as one in which 10% of COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care and reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were overcrowded.
The proportion of COVID-19 patients in hospital beds and/or intensive care units required at EU/EEA level is only 6% and 1% respectively, (these data are not reported).
Rather, these should be compiled in a well-organized manner in accordance with the data presented on the number of cases and deaths.
A 201011 survey showed a significant gap in intensive care and nursing beds in Europe, with Germany having 29.2 beds and Portugal 4.2 beds per 100,000 population.
This means that some countries have more or less health care facilities than Italy (12.5 intensive care and nursing beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The potential for a shortage of healthcare facilities, based on the estimated number of COVID-19 patients in hospital in each EU/EEA country and the UK, and the risk that the demand for intensive care beds could exceed 90%, are outlined in the sixth edition of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
As cases are still localized in the EU/EEA and UK, and as hospitals and acute care units serve populations in defined geographies, information on acute care patients and beds should be obtained in the form of Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience in Italy and other countries shows that the COVID-19 epidemic is growing at a rapid rate in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Hospitals and acute care units should therefore be prepared for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among local populations and the continued increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, especially acute care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC's emergency preparedness review, effective emergency preparedness is critical in preventing the transmission of SARS-COV-2, even if it is possible to move from containment to cure, as a sudden increase in the expected number of cases may not allow authorities and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and implement the necessary emergency measures if they are not implemented in advance.
An early diagnosis of the problem suggests health strategies to combat the problem.
There is limited evidence that countries have the capacity to increase their capacity to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare systems.
If this fails, it is expected that health services in other EU/EEA countries will be overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing number of patients requiring urgent care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and has infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a public health crisis.
As with the SARS-CoV-like virus, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible and causes similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 is less severe than SARS and has killed fewer people but is more transmissible and affects older adults and men than younger people and women.
In response to the many publications on the outbreak, this paper aims to present a comprehensive review of the outbreak.
We will discuss the basics of the disease, its causes, its germs, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prognosis and its prevention.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eliminate this disturbing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unforgettable occasion for Chinese people who were asked to stay indoors for the entire holiday and the following weeks due to the outbreak of a novel novel coronavirus.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The virus started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to the rest of the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had infected more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 cases recovered and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "man's number one enemy" and may be even more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including on the virus, disease, cause, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that found the virus genome isolated from a variety of patients.
The study aims to inform the research conducted in this newly developed airport at a rapid pace.
In the future, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-related illness, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which emerged in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the prevention of this disease and what assumptions are made as well as unanswered questions that are important.
CoVs were considered to be less dangerous to humans, accounting for about 15% of cases of influenza 4.
However, during this century, we have seen two major human-related coVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which first emerged in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then quickly spread to other countries with both disease and death rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV to emerge in known human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CoV genome sequence was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first confirmed case from Wuhan was reported.
During this time, the disease quickly spread to surrounding towns, cities, and countries.
On 20 January, a clinical case was reported, which meant that humans could have contracted the disease by passing it on to humans.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January the first clinical investigation of the disease reported that, of the 41 vaccinated patients, only 21 had come directly from the Wuhan fish market, which is thought to be the source of the disease from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global public health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread to China and at least 50 countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation changes, the outcome and the extent of the problem are yet to be understood.
On 11 February 2020, a randomized controlled trial of 8,866 people with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 provided a new definition of the virus (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but most are 30-65 years old.
The median age of the patients (47.7%) was over 50 years, few were under 20 years old, and only 14 patients were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more common in males (0.31/100,000) than in females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is spreading in the population more than in Hubei and vice versa.
COVID-19 lasted for approximately 5 (2-9) days from the time of onset to the time of diagnosis.
The duration of the symptoms was about 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The time from conception to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 value was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases peaked on 23 January 2020, due to the large number of people travelling ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The case fatality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), while the case conversion rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major COVID-19 risk factors were gender (men), age (≥60), and severe influenza.
CoVs are a large, round virus with a single stranded RNA.
It can be divided into four genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which both alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to cause disease in humans.
The (S) glycoprotein binds to the double-strand angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in this reaction, the two fatty acids are combined.
The viral RNA gene is passed into the cell; after replication of the viral gene, the RNA gene forms a complex of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins that form a viral enzyme, which then binds to the viral enzyme to produce the virus.
The first genome of SARS-CoV-2 was published on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of 99.98% in 10 samples tested at the first known site of infection, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV genetically than MERS-CoV.
Using ultrasound, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the airway portion of the respiratory tract.
ACE2 enzymes have been found to be inherited by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 enzymes but not as strongly as that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent in humans compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a short protein subunit called orf3b and a secreted protein subunit called orf8.
orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for human infection and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 is not a virulent agent.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, and colleagues, demonstrated the complete cryo-EM structure of the ACE2 enzyme at a resoolution of 2.9 Å in the amino acid residue B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which is a two-atom structure, was designed as a single-atom molecule and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex binds to S proteins, indicating the presence of a CoV and a host.
B0AT1 may be a target for treatment with a vaccine to weaken SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials.
Source and transport
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via camel bites, in the same species.
In comparison to SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, bat is considered the most commonly found vector of SARS-CoV-2 as the virus shares a 96% affinity with two other SARS-like CoVs that also reside in the bat called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Rather, the actual animal that helped the leap to humans has not been identified, and its route has not been confirmed.
Ji and his colleagues hypothesize that the newly introduced snakes were infected with the virus and passed it on to humans via S protein gene exchange.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, identified the pangolin - a small, silky-mouthed, insect-eating animal commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine - as a possible agent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans based on 99% genetic similarity in the CoV found in the mouse and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 0.1% between the two genes is still large; therefore, definitive data has not been obtained (Fig. 33).
The exact nature of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in glass for up to 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days in a temperature range of 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have some of the same conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be highly resistant to ultraviolet rays and temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% of the active ingredients, including chlorine, peracetic acid, californium, and other metal compounds, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in killing the virus.
The general population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore at risk of infection.
At present, no studies have been conducted to confirm a positive effect for SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can rely only on previously conducted studies of CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).
Generally, when a microbe attacks an animal, the first signals are detected by the pathogen's pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including the C-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs), Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus causes the formation, growth of dendritic cells, and production of interferon-induced I-forms (IFNs) that inhibit viral spread and increase the resistance of macrophages to the virus.
Instead, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help it escape from the bubble.
The adaptive immune response quickly joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes consisting of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a key role in the immune response.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to produce antibodies against the virus, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help maintain immunity.
Instead, the CoV can inhibit the T cell's function by causing T cells to die.
Humoral immunity including proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also important in fighting the virus.
For example, antibodies produced in a recovered patient have been shown to neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive physical activity causes the release of free radicals, which cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, sometimes causing organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which was detected in the first human case, appears to affect mainly older adults with underlying health conditions and pregnant women.
People with a different strain or a lower level of immunity are generally more susceptible to disease than others.
The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days according to the study of the first 425 patients in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the average duration of the virus is 3 days to show symptoms and the duration ranges from 0 to 24 days.
The latest study, mentioned above, shows that it lasts 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on 8,866 patients.
It is important for healthcare professionals to establish quarantine dates based on the exact timing of the virus's onset, in order to avoid infecting people who are not symptomatic.
Typically, people who live in a certain environment or who are infected with the virus need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first major symptom of COVID-19, which may be followed by no other symptoms or signs such as dry throat, difficulty breathing, muscle aches, dizziness, headache, throat pain, runny nose, chest pain, chills, wheezing, and coughing.
Some patients experienced difficulty breathing and/or shortness of breath within a week of being infected.
In extreme cases, patients were prone to pulmonary hypertension, low blood pressure (septic shock), metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory-related symptoms and acute fever, even if they do not have a lung problem, should be screened early for the presence of the virus.
A study of patients in December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% diarrhea, 76% severe diarrhea, 55% difficulty breathing, and 3% abscess; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were shown in two studies of patients with the same family and patients who did not show symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 human study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry throat (47%), and difficulty breathing (55%) as their main symptoms.
Rather, 80% of them required respiratory support, especially in COVID-19 patients, and this is consistent with the fact that MERS was more dangerous than COVID-19.
Dislocation (26%) and neck pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, it was reported that fever (99%-100%), dry mouth (29%-75%), difficulty breathing (40%-42%), shortness of breath (20-25%), and a sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and that respirators were required in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the new COVID-19 deaths were around 2% of the 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, the number of SARS deaths in November 2002 was about 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, according to the June 2012 population estimate, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies have shown that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, their specificity, and R0 is shown in Figure 1.1.
These figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less virulent than the other two.
However, it is much more difficult to contain SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
People with the condition often share a home, a convention, or a transportation facility.
The cases are those who have traveled from or have been in Wuhan or other outbreak areas or have had contact with infected or infected persons for at least two weeks prior to the outbreak.
However, it has been reported that people can be infected with the virus but do not show symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospitals can also become infected again, indicating the need for an extension of the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or decreased levels of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at baseline.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of &lt; 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of &lt; 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase increased with viremia were detected in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of myoglobin and coagulation enzymes were reduced in some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were also increased in most patients.
In patients who were critically ill, the amount of D-dimer, the fibrin degradation product in the blood, increased, and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
There is a chest disorder seen in most COVID-19 patients and this is accompanied by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity.
Patients often develop unusual pneumonia, sudden pulmonary involvement, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, there is a buildup and absorption of excess fluid, and the skin and wounds are covered which causes difficulty in oxygen exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduce the amount of surfactant and increase surface pressure, which reduces lung capacity and increases the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst results of a breast test are often equivalent to the worst disease state.
On February 18, 2020, the first clinical trial of COVID-19 showed the development of pneumocytes, production of hyaline, and the formation of skin, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of the infected patient, which is similar to the study of patients with ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary method for the detection of COVID-19.
However, due to the large number of positive and negative test results, which could exacerbate the epidemic, the health status indicator was introduced for testing (not based on RT-PCR alone) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation existed with the SARS test.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, symptoms, laboratory testing, and imaging is important and should be performed to make a correct diagnosis.
On 14 March 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a method to use a CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter were analyzed) using a dipstick in less than thirty minutes without the need for multiple tests.
It is hoped that this new technique will be useful in detecting the presence of a virus in samples tested in laboratories.
Due to the lack of knowledge about the unknown CoV, physicians are better able to monitor the outcome of COVID-19 patients, as they are testing different drugs that have been used or recommended in the past for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Figure 2).
This is a modern medicine that can also treat infections, reduce inflammation, steroids, blood (plasma) from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and anesthesia.
Plasma from recovered patients has also been approved for medical use.
Pharmaceutical companies are constantly developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and appears to later infect other ACE2 receptors, including the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory failure is the most common problem in patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory devices are essential in addressing respiratory problems and saving lives and this includes such measures as general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress should be assisted with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a procedure used to treat patients with severe respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating infections that may infect the patient with the virus, and protecting vital organs and tissues are also important in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been known that cytokine storms result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is an autoimmune response that involves the release of various cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the immune system to produce more molecules, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Reduction of the inflammation is important in treating cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm therapy for depression include induction of T cell-directed immune response; suppression of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, used to reduce the risk of infection, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the risk of infection.
However, the use of steroids in large doses did not reduce the risk of pneumonia in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
They also have the potential to cause serious side effects, particularly avascular osteonecrosis, which can affect the expected outcome.
However, corticosteroids have been reported to be used in severe COVID-19 patients in low doses.
At the time of writing, there is no approved treatment for the virus.
However, administration of remdesivir by injection, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antibiotic developed by Gilead that was originally used to treat Ebola and Marlburg virus infections.
Later, remdesivir was also found to be effective in treating other single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has approved the Chinese vaccine for testing in people with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have also been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for patients with severe respiratory distress.
Constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious complications may occur when lopinavir/ritonavir is combined with other medications.
Interaction of this medication with other medications when used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and generated antibody
The practice of drawing blood from people who have recovered from a transplanted disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent the disease from affecting living people has been around for some time.
In fact, people who recover from a disease usually have a high level of antibodies in their blood that can fight the disease.
Antibodies are antibodies produced by B lymphocytes to fight viruses and other foreign substances and to attack various molecules in the bacteria and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of COVID-19 patients and divided into 10 patients in critical condition.
Their condition improved within 24 hours, and their erection decreased and their viral load decreased and their airway was improved.
Rather, there must be a certain amount of confidence and imagination to make any method work for such a large number of people before such a method can be developed.
Also, due to the side effects of the drug, the plasma side effects must be considered first.
For example, antibodies can cause the immune system to overreact and cause cytokine release syndrome, which results in a highly toxic immune response.
Blood antibodies are usually low, and plasma is often needed to treat patients with severe disease.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is possible to isolate B cells from recovered individuals and identify the genetic codes of the antibody or to test for antibodies against the major viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a number of diseases in China for thousands of years.
Rather, its effectiveness is based on the combination of different ingredients in the drug that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease according to the TCM theory.
Most ingredients are unknown or unclear because it is difficult to analyze and verify the ingredients or ingredients.
Currently, as there is no known cure for COVID-19, TCM is one of the most commonly used treatments for patients with mild symptoms or who have recovered in a phased manner.
For example, the vaccines of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
Most patients recovered from COVID-19 in several provinces in China with TCM treatment in 87% of cases, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), as well as in Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 cases, where the recovery rate was even lower (13%).
However, this comparison is not fair because there are many other factors such as cost and the condition of the patients that have to be taken into consideration.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published the results of a study comparing the use of Western medicine alone with the combination of traditional medicine and TCM.
They found that the time it takes for body temperature to return, symptoms to disappear, and bed rest were shorter in the red + TCM group than in the red only group.
Interestingly, the incidence of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the white + TCM group than in the white-only group (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate was also lower in the white + TCM group than in the white-only group (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still needs to be tested with additional factors by being performed on more patients and in more locations.
It would also be interesting to explain the process and to explain the TCM processes that treat or create it if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are more likely to experience an increased fear of this highly contagious and dangerous disease, and people in quarantine may also experience feelings of loneliness, isolation, and anger.
In addition, medical symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and diarrhea as well as serious drug reactions such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can increase anxiety and confusion.
In the early days of the SARS outbreak, there were many psychiatric illnesses including major depression, anxiety, panic disorder, panic attacks, delusional thinking, attention deficit disorder, and suicide.
The forced search and quarantine of previously infected people, as part of the efforts to combat COVID-19, can cause people to feel more anxious and guilty about the consequences of the virus being transmitted, the quarantine, and the isolation of their family and friends.
Therefore, care in mental health conditions should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, their dependents and all people who need it.
The psychosocial support should include the establishment of teams of medical professionals in various psychiatric settings, timely and clear information about SARS-CoV-2 and treatment protocols and the use of smart devices to avoid close contact.
Vaccines are important in preventing the spread of infection from infected animals and humans to viable organisms and often work in conjunction with antibiotics to fight the disease caused by the newly emerging pathogen.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine based on the S protein to produce a more potent and effective antibody that inhibits and/or fights SARS-CoV.
A vaccine made from the virus itself is being tested in animals for SARS.
However, the efficacy of the vaccine in adult humans and in lethal-challenge models and its efficacy in animal immunization must be confirmed prior to clinical trials.
This is likely because SARS died 17 years ago and no one has been diagnosed with it since.
In contrast, there are frequent human cases of MERS in the Middle East and its spread to other regions is due to the presence of animals that live in those areas.
The MERS vaccine was developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, bacterial-like cells and recombinant protein subunits and was tested in animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in humans with mild immunodeficiency is urgently needed to combat the current crisis.
However, it is challenging to overcome this limitation due to the long time (about 18 months) required for the development and mutation of CoVs.
As a new disease, the full-blown COVID-19 response has been observed in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may recover gradually without remaining symptomatic.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients are more likely to become seriously ill and die.
Therefore, foreseeing the potential risks of the disease is important for health-care organizations to plan their services, especially in areas that are less accessible.
Based on the clinical studies performed, the following factors may be associated with the risk of complications in COVID-19 patients (Omesh33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in predicting the risk of infection for SARS patients, and this is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was more prevalent in people aged 30-65 years with 47.7% of cases in those aged 50 years in a study of 8,866 people as mentioned above.
Patients who required intensive care had other diagnoses and were significantly older than those who did not (at approximately 66 years compared to 51), suggesting that age is a significant factor in predicting the risk of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Other illnesses and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are at increased risk of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart failure was also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to recognize that age and other health problems are closely related and each can have a different effect on the other.
Unusual test results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood is an indicator of the resistance of a tissue to damage and has been shown to affect the patient's risk of complications, drug response, and overall survival.
The relationship between CRP values and the risk of complications for COVID-19 patients has also been discussed.
Further, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the effect.
These enzymes are expressed in high concentrations in various tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in response to injury.
Thus, they are often signs of a heart or liver problem.
Critical clinical symptoms: Chest imaging and monitoring of symptoms should be performed along with other measures to predict the risk of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are a potent anti-inflammatory and are widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases to reduce the inflammation of the joints.
Because high doses of corticosteroids were commonly used in SARS patients, many survivors developed a vascular osteonecrosis and remained disabled for long periods with poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients experienced severe mental stress due to spending long periods in quarantine and being unconscious and having seen their family members and fellow patients die.
These patients need to be comforted and supported for a while to help them recover from the stress and return to normal life.
Based on human studies, COVID-19 appears to have different symptoms than SARS.
In addition to being highly transmissible in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible in the upper respiratory tract and causes few to no symptoms in the first few days of infection, similar to other common influenza-causing CoVs.
Therefore, patients in the initial or late stage of infection may produce large amounts of the virus in their daily activities, complicating the immune response.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV is thought to have occurred at a higher incidence, so transmission was less common in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 pandemic is more severe and difficult to combat than the SARS pandemic.
A massive campaign is underway in China to lock down Wuhan and surrounding cities and quarantine almost all residents in hopes of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these events have been causing a severe impact on the economy and other national institutions, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating that the problem is getting worse.
The best estimate is that the problem will be resolved by Wednesday and that the decline will last 3-4 months.
However, other scholars do not hold this hope.
Paul Hunter, and colleagues, predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more pathogenic than SARS, will not disappear by 2020.
Longini, and colleagues, found a way to predict the outcome of the pandemic and estimated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian team noted that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in patients who recovered and were discharged 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be a recurrent strain of influenza.
Instead, encouraging signs have emerged in China in terms of a decrease in the number of new cases, suggesting that existing policies may be working.
Initially, Ebola was expected to infect one million people and kill half a million.
Instead, due to the careful application of quarantine and isolation protocols, the disease has been successfully controlled.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 could be attenuated in its ability to infect humans and subsequently eliminated or reduced in its ability to survive in humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is shown below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through contact with contaminated surfaces.
The virus was also found in poultry, suggesting that it is possible and possible to transmit the virus as a result of human infection.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of patients recovered from the infection in hospitals, including 17 patients diagnosed by other patients and 40 physicians.
Therefore, special precautions should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare professionals, commuters, domestic workers, workers, and people who are standing near the sick or infected.
The first strategy that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; the use of a cleaner and N95 (series # 1860s) both help to reduce the risk of infection.
The sanitary pads prevent contaminants such as human faeces from being released into the air or onto other surfaces, where they can be passed on to other people.
However, only the N95 vaccine (series # 1860s) is effective against 10 human pathogens at 80 nm, with only 5% of pathogens being able to pass completely; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since the virus can pass through surgical masks that are fastened together, doctors who approach patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, nurses should wear gloves to further reduce the contact with germs.
Bacteria can also infect a person's eyes when they pass through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a physician contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 patch; the virus may have entered his body through his blindfold.
Therefore, it is also advisable for physicians to wear a face mask or goggles when working with patients.
For the general population in areas where there is or may be a high risk of infection, it would be advisable for everyone to wash their hands with soap and water more often than usual, to try to stay indoors while self-quarantining and to reduce contact with people who may be infected.
A distance of three feet is considered to be a reasonable distance.
These practices are effective in reducing the chances of contracting and spreading the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus in humans, its close similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 would have provided China with a strong lesson in terms of its recollection of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020 the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan was still reassuring the public that the new virus was not highly contagious and did not have a high human-to-human transmission rate and that the disease was not contagious and resistant.
This information was very much in the public's mind, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the right time to combat the disease was lost prematurely in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies could use this knowledge to develop their next protocol.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful with their public messages because every word has meaning to citizens and can change their perceptions and decisions; (2) be more attentive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) increase efforts to combat a potentially dangerous disease outbreak in an attempt to calm people; and (4) work continuously to increase public awareness of the disease crisis and to monitor and improve the way people in the community address all issues at all times.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Due to the strong similarity of the virus to SARS-CoV and the similarity of symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to speculation that SARS is on the rise again.
Rather, these are the main differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in the control and treatment of the disease.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women, and the incidence and mortality are higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS is more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients are infected even when they are asymptomatic and SARS patients are infected when they are critically ill, making it much more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This is one of the explanations why SARS-CoV-2 is more rapidly and farther spread than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 and RNA testing can be shown to be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
In addition, patients who have been cured of the virus may develop the disease again.
These findings have greatly increased the chances of viral transmission.
Although this study was conducted in a hurry for COVID-19, several key issues remain unresolved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like viruses, we cannot yet determine the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the virus.
What animal, in the meantime, was the first to introduce a parasite from an animal, say a mosquito, into humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively control the spread, and the disease can return at any moment.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how does the virus enter the airway cells and cause disease?
Does the virus also affect the ACE2 receptors in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot quickly diagnose and actually find the right treatment.
How long will the illness last?
How does a virus mutate when it is transmitted to humans?
Will it become a global problem, will it disappear like SARS or will it come back in time like influenza?
It is important that you spend time searching for answers to these and other questions.
But no matter what it takes, all we can do is end the illness as soon as possible and get back to a normal life.
Coronavirus from animal sources
Genetic mutations have caused the coronaviruses (CoVs) and the animals they inhabit to change, including humans, over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two strains of human coronavirus (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, including the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has changed the landscape and exposed the potential for HCoV to become highly contagious and deadly.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has reintroduced the CoVs to the laboratory and surprised us with how much less contagious it is compared to the SARS-CoV variant.
HCoVs are of animal origin and understanding the animal origin of HCoVs is of great importance.
Most HCoVs originate in the intestines and are not virulent.
Some HCoVs in which animals first become infected before humans are also known.
Identifying animal pathogens is a key factor in preventing human disease.
Studying the relationship of CoV-host animals may also help to determine the extent of CoV infection in humans.
In this review, we summarize the recent findings of seven HCoVs, including their discovery history and their origin in the animal kingdom and their spread among different animal species.
Importantly, we show similarities and differences between different HCoVs in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current pandemic COVID-19 disease (COVID-19) is the one referred to in this context.
Other factors, such as the ability of the infected animal to mutate and the mutation of the virus, which indicate the severity of the disease are also discussed.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of viruses surrounded by a virus, each positive-sensitive, and containing a single stranded RNA.
These bacteria with the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in viral RNA were named CoVs because of their crown-shaped genome as seen in the test.
In structure, CoVs have an unstructured and cohesive genome.
About two-thirds of the genome is composed of two major sequence-linked proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b), which produce the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are then synthesized to produce 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein structure, CoVs are divided into four main subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV family has the largest number of HCoVs and is divided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
The results of the analysis suggest that the fungi and the mosquitoes are the most common sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the most common sources of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have been propagating from their animal ancestors and some have become the source of human disease.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the family of alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are more likely to cause mild infection, such as common cold and/or a stroke.
In contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are more virulent, affecting the lower respiratory tract in most patients and are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The original HCoV-229E strain, B814, was identified in the urine of patients with influenza in the mid-1960s.
Since then, there have been further discoveries through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, it was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the worst in recent history, with over 8,000 cases and an estimated 10% deaths.
A decade later, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused an epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula as it spread to other parts of the world.
2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020 when it arrived.
The tide has turned and the world must prepare for the global crisis of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs originate from bats, mice or domestic animals.
The overwhelming evidence suggests that all HCoVs originated from bats, where the pathogen is both benign and non-pathogenic but has a very different genetic make-up.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created major medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the origin of HCoVs in animals allows us to understand the history, motives and inhibitors of the transmission of the virus from one species to another.
This could also lead to a more rapid search for the source of SARS-CoV-2 from the animal origin to humans, which could have a significant impact on the avoidance of future outbreaks.
In this review we present information on the animal origins of HCoVs, their distribution in different species and their pathogenicity.
In particular, we point out and discuss the fact that HCoVs are harmless in the host animal but become virulent when they are transferred to another host animal.
We also study how the HCoV mutates as it is further infected and tends to decrease in virulence.
The effects of the current SARS-CoV-2 mutation are also discussed in this context.
Animal-derived CoVs have been known since at least the 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E subtype B814 was isolated from patients with previously common influenza, the CoVs were isolated in large numbers from infected animals, including chickens, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of the discovery of HCoVs in their lineage (Figure 1) will provide some insight.
The HCoV-229E strain was first identified in a group of patients with upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966, and was found to be growing in the WI-38 cell line of the lungs.
Patients with HCoV-229E had common flu symptoms, including headache, diarrhea, sore throat, and fever and diarrhea in 10~20% of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was detected in an organ culture system and later in a serial passage system in the brains of infected mice.
The clinical symptoms caused by HCoV-OC43 appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E, with symptoms not distinguished from other influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both globally distributed, and are most commonly found in winter in mild to cool climates.
On average, both viruses take less than a week to show symptoms, followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study of volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild case of influenza.
Only a few patients with low respiratory capacity suffered severe damage to the lower limb.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented global epidemic caused by HCoVs in human history and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was in late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
SARS infected 8,096 known cases and killed 774 people, affecting many countries and continents.
In addition to the most common known infections, it was estimated that each patient could have infected two other people, with symptoms appearing in 4 to 7 days with a peak of viral load occurring on day 10 of the infection.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experience neck pain, headache, fever, toothache and throat, followed by difficulty breathing, coughing and then fluid retention in the lungs.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are some of the symptoms of SARS that have been observed in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophage-induced cell proliferation are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and electronic ventilation equipment.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be damaged in these extreme conditions, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal especially in patients with low blood pressure.
The virus was first detected in the mouth of a lung transplanted from the lungs of a relative of the first confirmed case who had travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, much effort has been put into HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was detected in a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be more prevalent in children, the elderly and in patients with mild allergies and rheumatoid arthritis.
The incidence of cholera, measles, malaria, and bronchiolitis is common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
Other studies have found the same virus in a test from the nose of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was detected in the Netherlands, it actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of all respiratory infections, and is most prevalent in the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis (croup).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and pneumoconiosis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and pneumonia, HCoV-HKU1 has also been found to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected worldwide, causing a number of respiratory-related infections.
All of these HCoVs have been well characterized in humans and are generally not expected to evolve to cause a pandemic, although there have been outbreaks of unknown causes such as the rare variant of the pandemic HCoV-NL63, which has recently been shown to cause severe damage in the lower respiratory tract in China.
Overall, these HCoVs acquire the ability to move more easily and persist in humans, and become less virulent.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had severe diarrhea and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although all confirmed cases are from the Middle East, cases from other countries, including some from neighbouring countries, have been detected in several European countries and Tunisia.
The last outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 and 186 patients were confirmed.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, with a progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, most MERS patients also developed renal failure, which is currently the only MERS-related HCoV-related disease.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 patients confirmed in clinical trials had a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most virulent viruses in humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, cases of pneumonia with previously known SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current situation of the low-level infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases had been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the case fatality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, compared to 1.2% outside of the province.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory lesions similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, such as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Convulsions are also found in some patients.
Asthma is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress and cause complications in the respiratory tract.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology (82%), they fall on different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases have been identified and may help to speed up its spread around the world.
A comparison of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs revealed similarities and differences that need to be identified.
First, the timing of symptoms and the duration of HCoV infection are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 mimics the behaviour of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs (namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, a person with SARS-CoV-2 has symptoms that are commonly seen in a person with HCoVs, including mild, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of COVID-19 patients as infants can also be diagnosed as with SARS-CoV, although the sample size is not large.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also reflects the conditions found in the transmission of HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as robust as that of HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is not yet certain whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in negative samples.
The possibility of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 being as severe as with SARS-CoV in some cases is yet to be confirmed in future studies.
It is also important to consider whether SARS-CoV-2 may have undergone a period of adaptation similar to that of HCoVs.
However, the information on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the disease it causes and whether it can be transmitted to humans will be important to the outcome of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All mild infections caused by HCoVs in humans have been successfully treated.
In other words, it may also be true that humans have been successfully immunized against these HCoVs.
In other words, both of these could be the survivors of a previously unthreatened HCoV infection.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and in people who have had a severe HCoV infection have been eliminated.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans often enough to allow the replicated population to survive the next infection.
Thus, the more persistent SARS-CoV-2 is and the less it infects a large number of people, the greater the chance of its becoming known to humans.
Once it is well established, transmission in humans is difficult to stop by using lockdowns or other measures to prevent the spread of disease.
For many years, CoVs have been the fourth most common human infection causing chronic colds in people with normal respiratory function.
The insects do not need to hide in the animal's body.
In comparison, the most common pathogens SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not yet well known to humans and their transmission to humans is unlikely.
It must be present and alert in its environment and seek to influence and strengthen the weak, perhaps through one or more of the weak ones.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar symptoms to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and to four other human-related viruses known as HCoVs.
It is as transmissible as the human HCoVs, at least as far as is currently known.
However, it is more virulent than the human HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it has fully adapted to humans and spread to humans without any negative effects or living on a non-transmitting animal.
Before discussing the host species of HCoVs, it is useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of these terms, their evolution, ecology, transmission, host-containing and host-containing HCoVs.
An animal can self-replicate the HCoV if it has a similar genetic make-up that shares the same gene at the cellular level.
The newly produced virus usually adapts to the host and does not cause disease.
Similarly, the infected virus remains in the HCoV host for a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is the pathogen and the host organism is the HCoV or the parent organism.
In contrast, when HCoV is exposed to a host before or during its first contact with humans, it is not adapted to the host and is more likely to spread disease.
A host can act as a source of infection in humans and take over the host's role in the transmission of the virus by inhibiting the transmission of the virus and infecting humans and spreading the disease to humans.
HCoV cannot be transmitted if it cannot replicate on the host host.
In other words, HCoVs can adapt to the host organism's host and remain pathogenic for a long time.
In this way, the host becomes the natural host of the parasite.
Disease data has emerged suggesting that SARS transmission was associated with wild animals.
A study of wells showed that the animal traders had higher antibodies against SARS-CoV IgG in their bodies compared to other people.
Mice (Paguma larvata) and the common Asian racoon dog have been found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are highly similar to SARS-CoV.
This was further supported by the fact that after the killing of all the animals in the markets, the SARS virus was no longer detected.
However, wild or pastured chickens that were previously marketed were free of SARS-CoV, meaning that the animal would have been susceptible but not contagious and therefore not a natural candidate for SARS-CoV.
Well, since 80% of the different animal species in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV agents, the possibility that a small animal may also be active in the presence of the virus that transmits SARS-CoV cannot be ignored.
All of these appear to be host to SARS-CoV but not contagious.
As a result, the host organism of SARS-CoV showed some similarity to the bat CoV, SARS Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
This vaccine contains antibodies against SARS-CoV and the bacterial subtype BatCoV HKU3.
This and other novel coronavirus share 88-92% of the same genes as SARS-CoV.
This discovery laid the foundation for a new understanding that mosquitoes are hosts of new human diseases.
Several other SARS-like viruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the liver, but none of them except WIV1 can be identified as a live virus.
The enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 was derived from human liver samples and has been shown to use bile, plaque and ACE2 in humans as a means of immunization against viral infections.
Fortunately, the SARS virus strain in the recovering patients was able to induce WIV1.
Even so, WIV1 represents the closest relative of SARS-CoV in the genome, sharing 95% of the genome.
Despite the strong genetic similarity between the two viruses, it is widely accepted that WIV1 is not a direct ancestor of the SARS-CoV and that the genome is not closely related to that of the SARS-CoV.
The molecular evolution of MERS-CoV is grouped with CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
Both CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same bacterial host, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to infect the virus.
The genetic material (RNA) of MERS-CoV is similar to that seen in the bacterial beta-CoVs detected in Europe and Africa.
However, no live MERS-CoV virus has yet been detected in the feces.
MERS-CoV and its cousin virus CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the same genome.
Therefore, the lungs may not be the most susceptible to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels show MERS-CoV-like antibodies, as do camels in African populations of Middle Eastern origin.
MERS-CoV is a virus similar to the human virus that was isolated from camel saliva, further suggesting that camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that a small but significant number of infections were detected in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Of course, camels carrying the disease are not only the only ones who smoke, but also the main source of air pollution.
However, questions remain as MERS-confirmed patients have no known contact with camels as the symptoms are not present, which could be a human-to-human or a viral transmission pathway involving unknown animal species that contain MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the genome with the virus CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so large that it is difficult to determine the relationship between the viruses.
That is, the virus may not be susceptible to the host and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 unless a similar virus-like strain of CoVs is detected.
In theory, the host animal that transmits SARS-CoV-2 should be one of those wild species that is sold and traded in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first COVID-19 cases were identified, there is animal-to-human transmission of the disease.
Several recent studies based on genetic modification have suggested that the endangered pangolin (Manis javanica) group may also have a similar ancestry to the beta-CoVs that are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This unidentified Pangolin genotype with the CoV gene shares 85-92% of the same genes with SARS-CoV-2.
Rather, it is identical to RaTG13 with approximately 90% genetic stability.
They divided 2 sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 into a single lineage that shared a genetic structure with (RBD) SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of the genes being identical.
In a separate comparison, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were significantly different but were separated by genetic mutation.
Preliminary studies of infected pangolins also showed infection with bacteria in lung samples related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of techniques including genetic modification to obtain a genetic sequence containing 86.3% of the virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the few host species that do not transmit SARS-CoV-2.
At present, there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in pangolin that is clearly differentiated between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs in pangolin.
Similarly, the time interval between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is longer than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs of pangolin .
The exact nature of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other primates is not yet understood.
No genetic link has been identified between RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the same virus that causes SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the same genome.
It is expected that the strong similarity between RBDs in the pangolin-like SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is dominated by a single isolated gene.
A different proposal supports the incompatibility between pangolin SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the wild animal species.
As the dominant force in the evolution, neutralization is especially important in beta-CoVs.
A decision has not yet been made on the host strain of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the most common infectious agents of HCoVs, the animal source of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been investigated.
Evidence from genetic studies suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from mouse CoVs, while the ancestral strains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were identified from mice.
A newly identified coronavirus, ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was reportedly isolated in North America as a trichromatoma and showed a close relationship to HCoV-NL63.
In other words, HCoV-229E was genetically linked to a virus CoV, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, and which is also thought to be a host of the virus.
For information, the current animal source information for known HCoVs is provided in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Recent studies have provided evidence that HCoVS is spreading through species that are as diverse as they have been historically.
When HCoV-OC43 mutated from a single species to humans from domesticated animals in 1890, a virus associated with the respiratory system was identified.
The history of the spread of HCoV-229E variants is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been identified.
Among these is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several different data support the transmission of the virus from the mouse to humans directly.
First, humans - not alpacas - are closely linked to hamsters in their distribution of habitat.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are heterogeneous and do not cause lung infection, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused the disease in the respiratory tract of infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in domestic animals returning to the wild.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas derive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, the mosquito is the source of several viruses that transmit disease to humans including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
In other words, while alpha-CoVs act as the genetic source of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may act as the hosts of a non-transmitter virus in humans as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a good example of a highly transmissible virus that can be transmitted from a mouse to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the MERS-CoV mutation from the mouse is known from the early stage and the identification was confirmed in the mouse by its discovery.
It is clear that mosquitoes have a very diverse range of species that have evolved into different species and spread into different species.
The longevity, large number of species, close contact and high flight capacity all allow the fly to be a good transmitter of viruses.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been isolated from dromedary camels for a long time.
It is a perfect fit for camels that have evolved from a parasitic host to a parasitic host.
MERS-CoV causes a limited number of infections and is highly variable in the host.
The estimated human transmission is accidental and humans remain exposed to MERS-CoV but do not spread because transmission is not expected.
Compared to the role of camels in transmitting MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, when isolated, in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 is different.
More specifically, the pangolin beta-CoVs are the most common cause of disease in pangolins.
It may be a host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as is the case with SARS-CoV.
The potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans in various species is yet to be confirmed or evaluated in future studies.
First, the virus may have been infected with a SARS-CoV-2-like virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can compare the processes of the food chain to those of the mining industry.
Second, pangolins may be host to the pathogenic organisms that transmit SARS-CoV-2 viruses to which they are exposed.
People get the parasite by killing and eating the meat of the mosquito.
It is possible that hominids including domestic cats could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research in domestic and wild animals to identify the immune system is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the genetic incompatibility and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have fallen into a third category related to fungi and pangolin.
The investigation of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals is ongoing.
In addition to the host species, three main factors on the viral side are also important in determining the CoVs resistance to cross-species transmission.
First, the rate of replication appears to be the highest in the replication of RNA.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the viral viral viral load is estimated to be between low and high with a median annual rate of ~10-4 per second, depending on the CoV's adaptation rate to the previously unknown virus.
CoVs are known to be active on the exoribonuclease, and as a result of their active status, they become less active or sometimes inactive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to inhibit the proliferation of CoV by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA) genes.
Remdesivir is one of the SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
In addition, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than that of the virus itself.
Similarly, the mutation rate tends to be higher when the CoV is not familiar with its host.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting that it is now fully adapted to humans.
He may already have become accustomed to another human-like creature.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has previously been known to infect camels.
In theory, it appears that a genetic mutation could cause a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be less effective.
Second, the RNA genome expansion in CoVs suppresses the genome-wide recombination of the mutant, thereby increasing the probability of mutations in the gene, a positive factor in the evolution of the new CoVs if the mutation is successful.
This is supported by copious unique open reading frames and the importance of the protein located at the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often inadvertently change the host during transmission by a knockout-prevention process.
It is a bacterial virus that acts as a transducer, a mutation that occurs mainly during CoV RNA transcription.
Closely related RNAs and subgenomic RNAs can be combined to form a new CoV.
Information on the evolution of bacterial resistance has been observed in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal co-viruses such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Contact with a virus is a common source of infection.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host organism is also a major factor in the transmission of disease in various species.
In this paper, the SARS-CoV isolation is considered a well-known example of positive selection during transmission.
Based on a comparison between the isolates observed in human and mouse SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to have a rapid adaptation to host bacteria, especially in mutations to RDB in S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of CoVs is highly reactive to antibodies and highly selective by the immune system in the host.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acid sequence of the S1 fragment, which binds to ACE2 in humans and to the receptors of the bacterial interfaces.
SARS-CoV RBD can infect ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, mice, rats and raccoon dogs, allowing for cross-species transmission.
In fact, 6 amino acid residues were found to be different from those isolated from humans and spores in RBD and 4 of them are found in the same bacterial form as the ACE2 receptor.
The new SARS-CoV has a K479N mutation and its S487T RBD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein for human ACE2 receptors.
That is, the other two amino acid residues may be particularly potent in viral resistance.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 is a viral infectious agent that shares a similarity to SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 level of the S protein means that the S protein's affinity for ACE2 in humans may have been altered.
In fact, cryo-EM studies indicate 10-to-20 is a stronger relative in this enhancement than ACE2 in humans and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to see if another agent may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also enhances ACE2 but by using a different S subunit.
There are also many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also explain the adaptation of the CoV virus to humans after it has been transmitted from its host species.
In addition to host viruses, the HCoV-derived viral load is controlled by other factors that depend on the host's host and its resistance.
Differences in host proteins between humans and HCoVs-transmitting organisms such as bats, camels and rodents can act as a barrier to the transmission of disease in different species.
HCoVs have adapted to the host and avoided the host's barriers to the transmission of the disease to various species.
Thus, the molecular mechanisms in this central bacterial-hosting system still need to be analyzed and explained.
Genome-wide screening of SARS-CoV-2 viruses and their inhibitors using advanced technology may be successful.
Previously unknown outbreaks of HCoVs: back to the beginning
Variation in novel CoVs offers significant opportunities for the evolution of previously unknown HCoVs.
In this way, the single-celled CoV acts as a gene source for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene silencing also control the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important processes in this gene.
For example, the acquisition or loss of previously unknown protein-coding genes has the potential to completely alter the bacterial genome.
In SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in identifying humans, as the SARS-CoV virus that infects the lungs was isolated but found to have divergent ORF8 proteins.
29-nucleotide deletion signatures of SARS-CoVs have been identified in samples isolated early in the course of the outbreak of the disease in humans.
The breakdown split ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutation of the gene that promotes the alteration of the host.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of resistance to cross-species interaction in alpha- and gamma-CoVs, with a small degree of resistance observed in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Some of the sites were designated as nsp9, most as nsp10, and some as nsp14.
Similarly, it has been reported that the outbreak of MERS-CoV was a cross-species transmission, occurring in camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, multiple isoforms have also been identified in other HCoVs, where HCoVs are associated with animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It is also worth noting that human-induced virulence testing can produce unpredictable changes in viral genomes, mainly due to the response of viruses to the stresses of testing, such as those from the presence of a virus.
An example of this vulnerability is the severe loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to double nucleotide expansion.
While the unchanged ORF4 can be detected in the mouse and camel viruses that infected HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV exhibited nucleotide absorption, from the frameshift.
Last but not least, the growth of HCoVs has been unpredictable and is governed by selective inhibition of host host.
Symptomlessness or mild symptoms have been observed in the infection of CoVs, suggesting a cross-adaptation between CoVs and viruses.
It appears that the virus is better adapted to CoVs in its environment (anatomically) and in everyday life.
For example, structural weakness in the lungs reduces the unusual effects of CoVs.
In addition, the genetic death of the kidney is thought to be due to a reduction in the genetic expression of the NKG2/CD94 antigen and a lower expression of the active phase of the class I molecules.
However, the oxygen species (ROS) from metabolic activity in the liver can suppress the CoV's proliferation and impair proofreading by exoribonuclease, resulting in selective pressure to produce more pathogenic strains of the virus in a different host environment.
Other CoVs can also grow uncombined, producing new proteins or protein signals that allow the host to adapt.
Well, it is no coincidence that previously untreated HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in their vectors such as bats and mice.
It is more variable and does not cause severe damage to the host.
This includes the mystery of how the viruses that transmit asymptomatic diseases are detected and cause deadly disease in humans.
The most serious symptoms are from inflammation and symptoms of hyperventilation (cytokine storm) so that the more severe the inflammation, the more severe the lung damage.
Compared to people without symptoms, the incidence is limited by the frequency of CoV transmission.
A technique to remove the collateral of the vesicle may be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon reaction is particularly potent in the liver.
Therefore, the action of type I interferon on at least the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans has been shown to be positive.
Similarly, induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the lungs is ineffective.
In this context, suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in association with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak follows the same pattern of transmission as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks.
While it was found that beta-CoV shared 95% of the nucleotide with SARS-CoV, there was also a CoV that shared 96% of the nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
Some monkeys and other commercial animals have been found to contain SARS-CoV-like viruses, although the virus that causes SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs with a remarkable similarity to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, suggesting that pangolins may act as a non-transmissible pathogen or that pangolin beta-CoVs may have a genetic component that causes the development of the final SARS-CoV-2 strain.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is deliberately or accidentally produced by humans.
CoVs have reappeared in humans due to the recent mutation of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in mice and other animals have dramatically changed the understanding of the role of animal-derived infections and of the animal hosts of HCoVs in transmitting disease to humans.
The most recent data suggest that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of primitive origin and are transmitted to humans through the presence of non-transmissible agents.
Since SARS-CoV is caused by contact between humans and mosquitoes in markets, closing of supermarkets and mosquito control would have been effective in stopping the spread of SARS.
Similarly, pangolins should be removed from the fresh produce market in order to prevent the transmission of animal-to-human diseases, with a view to identifying specific strains of pangolin beta-CoVs that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other primates and how it is transmitted will be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camels for a long time.
Camels are a vital transportation vehicle, and they often provide much of the meat, milk, skins, and wool that humans need.
They are common in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore extremely difficult to kill all camels to prevent MERS, as was done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the outbreak of MERS, a vaccine for the disease must be developed to produce a direct MERS-CoV vaccine, which works in conjunction with other immunological mechanisms.
Since we cannot eliminate this virus, another strain of the virus can emerge and cause another infection.
A variant of CoV that transmits disease from animals to humans has spread in the wild.
In particular, it is a simple CoV that has the potential to transmit disease from animals to humans in many forms.
There is a high probability that the CoV that transmits disease from animals to humans is infected due to the emergence of a new CoV that is rapidly transmitted and/or in which humans are infected.
The practice of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the emergence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and management systems are required.
In fact, many microbes have been on earth for thousands of years.
They stay in their natural habitat until an opportunity arises and they move on to another place.
Although bats have a high potential for transmitting pathogens, the chance of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are warned to avoid them.
Concentration of the virus is required in animal-human species to better understand the evolution of CoVs and the genetic makeup of the pathogen that will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission of disease and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-to-human transmission of pathogens is from the natural environment where the pathogens are transmitted from animals to humans.
There is still much uncertainty about the origin of the animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats are transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is worthwhile to look at the extent to which bats and pangolins are interacting in their environments.
Second, if mosquitoes play a role in transmitting disease directly to humans, then human interaction with mosquitoes should be considered.
Third, if a hominid is infected with a non-infectious parasite, its interaction with other species including humans, bats and pangolins should be highlighted.
Finally, since many primates including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and testing for both infections should be performed.
If it is a mouse, pangolin or other animal like a human, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens closely related to it will be found in the host organism of the same species.
Further research on this topic will shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, including important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Communication of the basis for confirming suspected and confirmed COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team had published the emergency protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of people with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and these protocols were to demonstrate our expertise and demonstrate how to effectively combat this outbreak globally.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, whose identity is being improved based on the findings of ongoing research and treatment; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment are also being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of our guidelines and provided the most up-to-date guidelines for determining predicted and confirmed based on the latest guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the Peoples Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of the disease, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global health emergency.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a series of emergency measures that were published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
They have been widely read since their publication.
It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, the knowledge of which is evolving in line with the findings of ongoing research and clinical trials; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment are also being revised.
The Standard Testing and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has published seven publications with some cases having been completely reviewed.
Our model was presented by Zhou and colleagues, who devised a simple diagnostic method based on their clinical findings.
Their work has added to the evidence of our own success and has brought attention to this worldwide problem.
We acknowledge and commend their fine work.
Instead, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the new COVID-19 Testing and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) and new research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected patient it is necessary to combine one of the following two clinical criteria to make a final decision, or it is necessary to fulfill the three clinical criteria if no clinical criteria are available:
A history of infection: (1) having visited or stayed in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other areas where COVID-19 cases were detected within 14 days of onset of symptoms; (2) having been in close contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (a positive nucleic acid test); (3) having been in close contact with patients with measles or respiratory problems from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other areas where COVID-19 cases were detected within 14 days of onset of symptoms; (4) having been in close contact with infected individuals (≥2 cases with confirmed cases/symptomatic cases were detected within 2 weeks in community centers, such as community centers, schools, hospitals, etc.).
Clinical signs: (1) fever and/or difficulty breathing; (2) symptoms of missed breath that indicate infection with COVID-19; (3) white blood cell count, indicating normal, or initially decreased, lymphocyte count.
Confirmation of the patient should be performed on a suspected patient with evidence of infection or a blood test as follows: (1) a random PCR test indicates a person is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole viral genome sequencing has shown a strong similarity to the novel coronavirus; (3) a blood test indicates a person has IgM antibody and IgG specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2; or a change in the LGG specific antibody to SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or a positive test titer is ≥4 times longer than the recovery time from the critical period.
We note that the PCR test for the detection of nucleic acid in urine or blood was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
Diagnosis of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and Friday (8 February 2020); and evidence of urine testing was added to the seventh edition.
This change is based on research efforts to develop a product that can effectively isolate nucleic acid for rapid testing, as well as samples from the blood sample collection system, which increases the availability of multiple tests, and supports the need for specific antibodies as one of the criteria for identifying a patient.
In addition, there is a lot of other evidence that reminds us to be careful with patients who show or do not show any unusual symptoms.
Therefore, the chart of Zhou and colleagues should be revised, as it shows a person without symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system also needs to be validated in other clinical and clinical studies.
In summary, we hope that further evidence will be forthcoming and invite the reader's comments.
With the knowledge of the predicted and confirmed, we recommend that you follow and obey the latest laws of your country.
Our team will update our tracking information in time to help you.
Bangladesh reports five more deaths from COVID-19, the highest number of daily deaths
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed that five more people died from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day in the history of the virus.
By yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had registered 114 patients and 33 recovered at home.
A total of 17 people died.
In a news release posted online, the IEDCR official, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two of the deceased were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50 years old.
He said that two of the men were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, an official of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Bangladeshi Transport Minister Obaidul Quader while delivering the video announcement said that all the transportation around the country will be suspended for a longer period than originally planned, until the following Saturday.
The suspension of the train had started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on 4 April.
The transport of basic goods -- medicine, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were reported on 8 March, with two people who had arrived from Italy and one of them a woman.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infected one million people worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases had exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 people have reportedly died from COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
This was achieved on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first case and Zambia recorded one death from coronavirus.
North Korea said on Thursday that it was one of the last remaining countries that had not yet been hit by the coronavirus.
On Monday afternoon the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 new cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 4am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases have been reported and at least 5,900 deaths have been reported.
CBS News quoted Johns Hopkins University as saying that there were more than 1,000 deaths from the coronavirus in the US on Wednesday.
Worldwide, nations are announcing urgent measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until 1 May.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will be paid even if they do not go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the 15-day moratorium, with a majority of 215 in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the coffee hour in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to a full day; initially, coffee was available between 9 pm and 12 am.
Thailand prepared coffee between 4 pm and 10 pm.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the curfew until May 1.
Australian supermarkets limit the number of chickens that can be bought at one time
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, Australian supermarkets across the country, Woolworths and Coles put their limit on the number of coconut shops that can be found in any one or two stores in the country.
ALDI also set a limit of one unit on Monday.
The ban was posted as a public message on the companies' Facebook pages.
Customers were told to be prepared for COVID-19 as people were required to quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of chickens that are bought and sent home if a person earns one pound per day.
The changes follow the first restriction of four ads per share brought by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 by both companies in the auction.
In a post on 8 March, Coles noted that the ban on the use of the advertisements was "a little over an hour old", and that the demand was "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
The stock has reached a record high last week according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco in Canberra also set a limit of two bags per week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles had the stewards make more bags and increase the frequency, Woolworths had the supplies increased, and ALDI had the supplies increased as scheduled for the special Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase their sales but are hampered by local government restrictions on the number of vehicles they bring in.
It expects to increase the amount of money spent, as the staff try to accommodate the demand and the short-term differences.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the launch of the instant store, some stores will not be able to offer specials on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a marketing expert from Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are delivering goods every day.
He said that the chickens are so large that the prices of the products sold in the stores are so low that when they are sold out, the chickens are left as pests and there is a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that "Coles and Woolworths think [that] if there's more of a supply chain, products like toilet paper and hand sanitizer [are] made available in quantity, the leakage can be reduced".
The chicken farmer who feeds the sheep on Wednesday said that the chickens were gone.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes the bags, and Solaris Paper, which makes the Sorbent, insisted they were working 24/7 to keep up with demand, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some vendors were giving away free cookies to the first winner of the auction in Melbourne, with little sales due to the fact that buyers had a long weekend off including Labor Day.
In a Thursday edition of the NT News, a daily newspaper in Darwin, there was a book that was about eight pages long that had to be taken out and used as a toilet.
The stores initially refused to impose the limit, according to a report from ABC Australia on 3 March, but said they had no plans to impose the limit on sales.
Russell Zimmerman added that items are also on sale including towels, hand sanitizers, dry foods, hand soaps and detergents.
Similarly, outside Australia, the online marketplace Ocado was seen on Sunday evening banning the purchase of Andres chickens for between 2 and 12 chickens.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global health emergency
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19  caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  as a global emergency.
Although the term "global epidemic" refers to the extent of the disease spread, rather than the threat posed by individual cases, WHO suggested that governments should take action:
"All countries can change the nature of this global problem.
If they can monitor, diagnose, treat, isolate, monitor and mobilize the world on this issue", said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned by the scale and the danger of this epidemic and its over-representation".
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) described the epidemic as "unexpected".
He said, in a statement published on CNN in February, that "except for it, no other virus that attacks the respiratory tract has been identified since its outbreak until it has spread anywhere in the world".
Ghebreyesus shared the same sentiment, stating that "we have never seen a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
He added that "we are also not seeing a global problem that can be prevented".
The new global epidemic came after the WHO decided in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, described the outbreak as "an unstoppable, unstoppable epidemic that is on the verge of collapse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVOID-19 worldwide, of which 4,600 have died.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared a public health emergency on 30 January 2020, and a global emergency on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories and approximately 97,000 people have died.
Some 364,000 people were saved.
The death rate is estimated to be around 4% in China, while globally it is 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, chills, and shortness of breath.
Complications of the disease can include diarrhea and severe respiratory problems.
The time from infection to symptom manifestation is about five days but ranges from 2 to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or treatment against the virus.
Primary care is limited to symptoms and limited help. Preventive measures include hand washing, covering mouth as a precaution, isolation from others, monitoring and isolation if suspected of having the disease.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, restrictions on movement, work restrictions and lockdowns.
It has also caused a decline in the health and economic well-being of people worldwide, the increase or decrease of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as the creation of certain shortages of goods due to the mass consumption of goods.
Schools and universities have been closed at national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of students worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of hateful attacks and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people or those who are similar to others from the areas where the virus is most prevalent.
Due to the closure of transport and large industries, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a few cases of unknown dengue fever as of 31 December 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases were identified in connection with seafood at Huanan (Seafood Wholesale Market) and the virus is believed to have originated from animals and spread to humans.
The virus that caused the outbreak is SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is similar to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The first case of the outbreak was detected after an illness on 1 December 2019, and the person was not found to have any genetic link to the virus.
Of the cases first reported in December 2019, two-thirds of them were found to be linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, a controversial report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the previous case on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, may have been the first.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that after new cases had been reported in China but rapidly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China once it had been fully contained.
There may have been a misrepresentation of the actual number of patients, especially those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, the small number of cases reported among young people aged 19 years and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population could have been infected with the virus before severe infection was detected in the population.
Cases refers to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and tested positive for the virus according to official statistics.
23 As of March, no country had tested less than 3% of its population, and many countries have a policy of not testing those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A survey published on 16 March showed that in China, as of 23 January, about 86% of patients had not been vaccinated, and that those who had not been vaccinated accounted for 79% of those vaccinated.
A review of the data released on 30 March suggested that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than previously reported.
The initial estimate of the primary reference rate (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the average risk is 5.7.
Most people who get COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not survive, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, but the average is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 people were reported to have died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of the deaths were among those over the age of 60, and 75% had other illnesses including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official death toll for COVID-19 is mostly reported by those who tested positive for COVID according to official data.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be higher because there may be no deaths without a diagnosis - for example, at home, in a nursing home, or elsewhere.
Partial data from Italy found that the death toll during the pandemic exceeded that of the official COVID numbers by 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "We know that [the death toll] is not accurate", and confirmed this to the American public.Incorrect measles are common during seasonal outbreaks such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu.The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside of China was in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
On February 28, outside China, more than 12 people died in each of these countries, Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
13 On March, more than forty countries and locations reported the deaths of people from nearly every continent except Antarctica.
These rates vary by region and time and vary by the number of tests, quality of care, available treatment, time since onset, and demographic characteristics such as age, age group, and overall health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated death rate relative to the number of cases has decreased from 17.3% (for those with onset of symptoms on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).The measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with a disease and the case infection rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of patients (vaccinated and unvaccinated) who have died from a disease.
These numbers are not fixed in time and follow certain individuals from the time of diagnosis to the time of diagnosis.
Several researchers have attempted to estimate the numbers of some populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall incidence of syphilis is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimated number in this range reflects the results of the first COVID-19 screening tests in Germany, and the statistical analysis of the tests that produced the estimated mortality.
WHO estimates that this global epidemic is preventable.
The incidence and duration of the disease are unknown and may vary from one place to another.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "The disease that is left to fester is uncontrollable, it is aggravated and begins to decline when the disease is not controlled.
But it is almost impossible to make a precise prediction at this point".
Senior adviser to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan said that it "could be gone by the end of June" if all countries could be encouraged to follow WHO recommendations and guidelines to curb the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, probably for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, long-term isolation and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"I think that this coronavirus - because it is spreading so fast - could become a chronic disease with a recurrence every year", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The danger of its return will depend on its previous status and its current status.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be subtle and people with the disease may not show symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry chest (68%).
Rare symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, wrist pain, sore throat, headache, feeling windy/panic, nausea, hemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO says that one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the immediate symptoms as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain, feeling faint, difficulty walking, and swelling of the face or mouth; immediate medical attention is required if symptoms are present.
Some patients may be asymptomatic, but if they are confirmed to be infected, then researchers have recommended that those who come in contact with those who have been confirmed to be infected should be closely monitored and not be forced to confirm their infection.
Estimates of China's infection rate range from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (the time from infection to onset of symptoms) is usually from one to 14 days; it is usually five days.A sample that shows no evidence, the estimated rate of infection with COVID-19 was initially 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some of the mechanisms of disease transmission are still unknown.
The disease is thought to be spread by contact with infected persons and contact with infected urine, which is transmitted by coughing, sneezing or talking; the contact distance is usually between 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that the removal of the oil from the mouths of the pipes causes the water to flow at a depth of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27t).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be spread by long-term exposure to airborne fluid, which can be released during speech, and by respiratory secretions during and after speech, although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air.
The fluid can travel to the mouth or nostrils of people nearby or be absorbed into the lungs.
Some treatments such as catheter catheterization and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause a hole to be opened in the lung and thus the infection spreads through the air.
It can also be spread by contact with an infected surface such as the skin, and by contact with the face, joints or mouth.
While there is a risk that it could spread to the wrong, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread in a negative way.The virus is most prevalent during the first three days of symptoms, although transmission is possible before symptoms appear and during the later stages of infection.
People are diagnosed with the disease three days after the onset of the disease, even if no signs of infection are present, and even if severe symptoms are not present.
There are few reports of confirmed cases with no symptoms, but transmission from asymptomatic individuals has been observed in some countries by contact tracing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not clear how the disease spreads, the average person infects between two and three people. The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus has been found to survive for three days on polypropylene and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard and for four hours on paper.
However, this varies depending on the air source and temperature.Fox and wildlife have also been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the UK health authorities recommend that people wash their hands after touching an animal, as well as for touching objects that people suspect are infected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a previously unknown virus, first identified in three patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome who had a severe acute respiratory syndrome as seen in Wuhan.
All previously unknown SARS-CoV-2 viruses are associated with the coronavirus, which resembles a mosquito.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, a soap that kills the virus's protective membrane.SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have originated in animals and then spread to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus in its genetic structure is similar to the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) and two bat-derived strains.
It has 96% similarity at the whole genome level to other viruses in its sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid in certain regions of the genome sequences between the bacteria from pangolins and those from humans.
To date, the most comprehensive whole genome comparison has found that 92% of the genes shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 are shared by pangolin, which has not yet been confirmed as the most transmissible pathogen.
The presence of the virus can be detected by early symptoms, but confirmation is usually done by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in infected tissue or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that using CT is more accurate than PCR, although this is not clear, and the imaging is less likely to be associated with other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should be used for screening or used as a primary test for COVID-19".
WHO published a set of RNA test kits for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on samples of respiratory fluid or blood.
The results are usually seen within a few hours to days.
Generally, the test is done on a nasopharyngeal swab although a nasal swab may also be used.Many laboratories and companies are developing blood tests to screen for antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these had been proven scientifically effective enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States a blood test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use in approved clinical trials only.
Imaging signs on radiographs and CT scans of people with self-reported symptoms include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is in the process of creating an online collection of images from people who have been diagnosed with the disease.
Due to the interaction with other infectious agents such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation cannot be reliably confirmed in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT scan of the chest with PCR and suggested that even imaging is not an accurate indicator of disease, suggesting that it should be used with caution in the diagnosis of disease-affected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to improve the accuracy of viral imaging using radiographs and CT scans.
Prevention measures to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining general hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with the face, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and peeling or rinsing with a cloth or paper and then placing it directly in a garbage disposal.
Those who may be ill have been advised to wear a mask when out of the house.
Many governments have restricted or advised against travel unless it is absolutely necessary to travel to or from an infected area.
Instead, the virus has reached the point of spreading to a persistent area in many countries around the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some people in the community do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare professionals/doctors caring for a person who may be infected are advised to exercise caution, contact with caution, and wear face masks. Contact tracing is an important strategy for health care providers to identify the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy as Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published documents showing the limits of such tracking.
Various mobile apps have been disabled or disabled for unknown reasons, and as of 7 April 2020, more than 20 government groups were advising on privacy issues such as using Bluetooth to connect the user's phone to other devices.
Users receive messages if they have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.Disinformation is being circulated about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are developing a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of infection.
The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water regularly for at least 20 minutes, especially after going to the bathroom or if your fingers look really sore; before eating; and after you have coughed, coughed, or coughed.
This is because outside the human body, germs are killed by the household soap, which kills the skin.
The CDC further recommends the use of a disinfectant with an alcohol content of at least 60% when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their face, nose, or mouth and fingers before washing.
Surfaces can be disinfected using a special water solution (in one minute if the product is made of steel and has been touched by a patient), which contains 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-75% povidone-iodine.
Other water-based solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, have less effect.
The CDC recommends that if a person is suspected of having COVID or is confirmed to have it in a place such as an office or child care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, air conditioners, limousines, and ATM machines used by a patient should be disinfected.
Health authorities are recommending that people cover their mouth and nose with a surgical hand or tissue as soon as possible.
Masks are recommended for those who may be ill, as wearing a mask can restrict the amount of time a person can talk, cough and sneeze.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how a person should use a condom.
According to Stephen Griffin, a microbiologist at the University of Leeds, "Cloaking can reduce the risk of infection by contacting the face and is a source of more infectious diseases than hand washing. Cloaking is also recommended for the treatment of a person whose nose may be infected.
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only during high-risk situations such as treating a COVID-19 patient, although it also believes that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their face.
Many countries have started to encourage the wearing of face masks by all citizens.
In the United States, the CDC recommends people wear a non-invasive, non-invasive, non-invasive mask made of cloth.China recommends disposable medical masks, especially when coming within 1 metre (3 feet) of people.
Hong Kong is allowed to wear a mask when riding public transport or when living in crowded areas.
Health officials in Thailand are urging people to wear masks at home and bathe daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from leaving their homes without wearing face masks or a mask.
On 16 March, Vietnam required everyone to wear a face mask when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone who enters the store must wear a mask.
Israel has required every citizen to wear a mask whenever they are in public.
Taiwan, which has been processing ten million masks a day since mid-March, on 1 April mandated that passengers on trains and buses traveling in cities wear masks.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks whenever you leave home, and they also encourage people to make their own face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy one.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Distancing involves taking measures to prevent the spread of disease by limiting contact with other people.
Activities include quarantine; restrictions on movement; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, parks and shops.
Individuals can take steps to keep themselves at home, limit travel, avoid crowds, greet without touching, and avoid contact with others.
Many governments now require people in areas affected by the disease to isolate themselves.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health departments has been reduced from 250 (if there are no COVID-19 cases in the community) to 50 and then to only 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany cancelled gatherings of more than two people.Adults and those with other chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illness, hypertension and dysfunctional ovaries are at high risk and are advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible, especially in areas with high prevalence.In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies used the terms isolation and air isolation to describe the intention to reduce contact with other people but to avoid social contact or isolation.
The use of the word "separate" has come to mean that people should be separated from each other, rather than encouraged to maintain contact through other means.Some authorities have issued guidelines for safe sexual intercourse in emergencies.
This includes encouraging them to have sex only with their partner, who is neither infected nor has any symptoms of the virus.
Isolation is recommended for those who have been tested positive for COVID-19 and those who are suspected of having the virus.
Health departments have issued individual quarantine guidelines.Many governments are requiring or recommending self-quarantine for all people in affected areas.
The strictest quarantine orders have been issued for the most dangerous areas.
Those who may have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 and those who have contracted it in a country or region where the disease is highly prevalent are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time they may have been exposed to the disease.
The tactics in preventing and treating it include fighting or preventing it and preventing it.
Prevention is carried out at the beginning of an outbreak and aims to monitor and isolate those affected as well as to introduce additional measures to control and contain the spread of the disease in the remaining population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of a disease, the focus turns to control the disease: measures are taken to reduce the spread and to prevent the consequences in the health system and in society.
Both the prevention and the control mechanisms can be used simultaneously.
The curve is a measure of the rate of spread of infection and the rate of spread of disease. One of the ways of controlling the curve is to try to reduce the spread of disease by flattening the curve.
This reduces the risk of health services working too hard and spending too much time on the vaccine.
Non-pharmacological measures that have helped to control the outbreak include, individual prevention measures, such as hand washing, wearing masks, and self-quarantine; community-based measures aimed at reducing the spread of the disease, such as closing schools and disrupting public gatherings; encouraging people to participate in such activities; and community-based measures, such as cleaning up areas and equipment.
Other countries have also introduced measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea initiated a public quarantine and quarantine, and issued a travel alert for infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who quarantined themselves due to illness and severely punished those who refused.
Taiwan continued to develop cancer and vaccinate people who had hidden the vaccine.The British and American studies show that prevention (mitigating rather than preventing the spread of the disease) and control (preventing the spread of the disease) are both challenging.
The most effective disease control strategies can reduce the need for treatment by two-thirds and reduce mortality rates and decrease the number of deaths but often result in thousands of deaths and hospital stagnation.
Prevention can be effective but must be undertaken until the virus has spread to humans (or until a vaccine is developed, if first), but disease can return if measures are taken.
Long-term efforts to control disease are costly and exhausting.
There is no approved vaccine for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop a vaccine, including the testing of existing vaccines.
Taking over-the-counter flu medication, drinking fluids, and rest may help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the injury, ventilation, water supply and ventilation may be required.
The use of steroids can complicate the situation.
Several compounds previously used to treat other viral diseases are being investigated for their use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also stated that "some of the traditional therapies" may alleviate some of the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and flexibility in the treatment of COVID-19 patients as defined by WHO is a key factor in addressing the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO European Office issued guidelines to hospitals and primary care providers to implement healthcare at various stages including focusing on the healthcare system in the detection of COVID-19, taking non-emergency measures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and increasing the availability of specialized care by training staff and increasing the number of equipment needed to support the delivery of healthcare services.
There are several theories as to the origin of the first patient (the so-called patient zero).
The first case of an unknown coronavirus was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a period of one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily rising.
These were linked to the Huanan fish market (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market), which sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, its source is in an animal.A strain of influenza of unknown cause was detected on 26 December by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, as reported by Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, the medical team at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted colleagues to the possibility of a virus similar to "SARS coronavirus".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were charged by the police for spreading false information and Ai Fen was charged by his superiors for beating a witch.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
Several cases of unidentified virus had already been reported to the authorities in Wuhan to begin investigations in early January.When the outbreak began, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by the Chinese New Year celebrations and the fact that Wuhan is a busy city and a major rail hub.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in a single day, with two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data showed that 6,174 people had been infected by 20 January 2020.[citation needed] On 26 March, the United States surpassed China in the number of confirmed cases worldwide.[citation needed] As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 cases had been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and 364,000 had recovered.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the crisis in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have imposed restrictions on free movement and have imposed restrictions on their borders.
Some of the countries that have implemented measures to prevent the spread include quarantines (also known as stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns) and restrictions on movement.As of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or about 90% of the total population, were living in the United States, more than 50 million people were living in the Philippines, 59 million people were living in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were living in India.
As of 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were infected with the virus and the number increased to 2.6 billion two days later, almost a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 is believed to have been identified on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; there is an unconfirmed report of the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian identified a group of unidentified patients who had brought him in on December 26, after which the hospital where he worked informed the authorities in Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of samples from patients on 27 December 2019 showed positive for the SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Following the announcement, doctors in Wuhan were alerted by the police to spread the word of the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission previously said that there was no "definitive data" to prove human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign that Chinese Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping described as a "people's war" to combat the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", the lockdown was announced on 23 January to stop travel to and from Wuhan, and was extended to at least 15 cities in Hubei, affecting an estimated 57 million people.
The use of private cars was banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was also built, later named Leishenshan Hospital, to serve other patients.

The coronavirus outbreak could result in 47 million job losses in the United States and an unemployment rate of 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimate.Lockdown in India has left millions of Indian workers unemployed.A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have been affected by unemployment.Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the mid-March 2020 unemployment crisis.
In the second half of March, 4 million workers in France applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million workers in the UK applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German concept of part-time work and paid work has also been introduced in France and Britain.
The arts and culture sectors have also been hit hard by the crisis, which has affected the efforts of companies and individuals who use them around the world.
The cultural institutions have tried to maintain their functions (often paid for by the public) of allowing people to visit cultural sites, protecting the health of their employees and other members of the public, and providing support to artists where necessary.
In March 2020, across the world, libraries, museums, museums, and other cultural institutions were closed as exhibitions, events were postponed or extended.
This was followed by a massive campaign to reach people through online services. Another result of the pandemic was the suspension of religious services, sports, other entertainment events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology workshops, and fashion events.
The cinema has also been disrupted, the Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, held during the last week of Lent, have been cancelled.
Many churches have asked elderly Christians to stay home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have put prayers on the radio, online or on television while others have prayed in their cars (drive-in worship).
When the Roman Catholic Church closed its churches and the churches in St. Peter's Square and emptied the monks, other churches also stopped their prayers and reduced the number of people meeting in churches, mosques, synagogues, shrines and cathedrals.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the suspension of Friday prayers in the affected areas and mosques were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its citizens from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the worst disruption to the sporting calendar since World War II.
Many of the most popular sports have been added or updated, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA, and 2019-20 NHL.
The pandemic disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start at the end of September; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games would be rescheduled beyond the end of 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021".Casinos and other sports venues around the world were closed and poker tournaments were also postponed or cancelled.
This has led to a surge in online gambling, with online gambling sites now reporting a sharp rise in the number of gamblers. The entertainment industry has also been hit hard, with many bands cancelling or cancelling their concert tours.
Many of the major theatres including those on Broadway have also canceled all their productions.
Some artists have experimented with alternative ways of releasing and sharing their work via the Internet in place of the traditional live performance method, such as live streaming concerts or web-based "festivals" where artists can perform, broadcast, and share their work.
On the Internet, the news about the coronavirus has spread so that many people have started to make it a joke and play around with ignorance.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a significant increase in prejudice, racism, and racial bias observed against people originating from China and East Asia, as well as people from the most affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
There is a sense of dread, of terror, of brutality, in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from Tuesday (when most cases are still in China) have revealed a racial bias towards Chinese groups around the world who are deemed to be infected or exposed to what is considered to be a fair retaliation.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China protests.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported that they are discriminated against because of their ethnic origin.
There has been support for the Chinese, online and offline, and for those living in the affected areas.
As the virus spread to other countries, people in Italy, the first European country to be severely affected by COVID-19, also began to experience stigma and discrimination.Nations in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions banning Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian citizens in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in discrimination and harassment.
President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus "China virus", a term that critics have called racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens in Wuhan to take them to Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, now connected to China, studying in major Indian cities reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus.
The president of the West Bengal branch of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese were destroying the environment and that "it was a divine punishment for them".
The remarks were later criticised by the Chinese ambassador in Kolkata, who called it a "mistake".In China, xenophobia and ethnic prejudice towards non-Chinese nationals have been exacerbated by the epidemic, with foreigners being labelled "foreign trash" and followed by "throw-away".
Many newspapers with paid editions have removed them and replaced them with information on the coronavirus in some or all of them.
Many scientific journal publishers have discontinued their papers on the disease.
Some scientists chose to share their findings quickly on a convenient site like bioRxiv.

The clinical trial for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus that causes SARS-CoV-2 includes both virus detection and antibody detection mechanisms that are activated by the virus.
The presence of viruses in the samples tested is confirmed by RT-PCR, which is the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test was performed as a test for RNA for SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to confirm the presence of a virus or a virus that has been passed on.
Antibody testing (serology) can be used to diagnose a disease or to determine the number of people who have been infected.
Antibody testing shows how many people have been infected, including those with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization or those who did not show symptoms.
The exact number of people who have died from the disease and the susceptibility of the population to the disease can be determined by this type of testing.
Due to insufficient testing, as of March 2020 no country had accurate data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
23 As of March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are wide variations in the number of tests worldwide.
These differences may affect the mortality rates, which may be significantly higher in some countries.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) technique, these tests can be performed on samples of the respiratory tract obtained by various techniques, including nasal and oral administration or a characterized sample.
The results of the treatment are obtained in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR assays with reliable molecular response are performed only during the first week of infection.
The bacteria can then disappear into the air as it replicates in the lungs.
For patients who are tested in the second week, test samples may be collected from the airways using a suction catheter or a catheter may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in February 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and this was the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test protocol on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It looks for the "E" gene found in all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene found only in SARS-CoV-2.[citation needed] In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel test for government testing through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three-stage genetic tests on the oldest test systems showed inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, as well as a problem with testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to less than 100 samples being available for use by the end of February 2020.
The two-step test was not found to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then state and local testing was not allowed to start testing.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under its Emergency Use Authorization program.The US clinical trial began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced that COVID-19 testing was available nationwide based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; collection and processing of samples must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and published by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the test kit was registered with the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic developed a COVID-19 test.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours in bulk, allowing one device to test approximately 4,128 people in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency approval to Abbott Laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar approval to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an immediate approval from the FDA to perform a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved testing using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this method does not require temperature adjustments, it can produce positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to expand the capacity to test 50,000 people per day.The test uses monoclonal antibody to target the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of a novel coronavirus being developed in Taiwan, which is expected to provide results in 15 to 20 minutes as with the rapid influenza test.
A review of the data in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic imaging is not useful in the early stages, and CT [computed tomography] results may be present before symptoms appear".
Commonly seen in CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities as well as peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation are all associated with progressive disease.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan in the outbreak zone showed that CT is much more accurate than PCR, although it is less accurate, as many of its images are misleading and confuse other viruses and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology advised that "CT should not be used to diagnose or make an initial diagnosis of COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC was endorsing PCR for initial diagnosis.
One of the most important functions of the immune system is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect the virus in people as early as 7 days after symptoms appear, to diagnose the disease, and to monitor the number of people infected.The testing can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or in point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-throughput automated systems in several laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the volume of each system produced.
For CLT, a single-dose blood test is usually used, although other blood tests may be used to monitor the clotting process.
In PoCT a single blood test is usually obtained by a skin prick.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction step is not required if the test is not performed.As of 26 March 2020, the FDA has received 29 regulatory approvals and can now distribute their own antibody test kits.
On 7 April 2020, only one of the tests had been cleared by the FDA for emergency approval.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
They can test hundreds of samples in a few hours and are therefore much faster than traditional PCR methods for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of a person being infected.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody kits it had purchased were working properly.
Hong Kong introduced a system where if a suspected case remains at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a collection of samples", the patient will be infected, receive a sample and receive the test results.The British NHS announced that it was piloting a system to test suspected cases at home, which would determine the risk of the case spreading to others in the hospital or being contagious if an ambulance was used.In the COVID-19 testing system, if a case is found at home, a doctor will collect samples following the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through testing centers have enabled South Korea to conduct rapid testing, on a larger population than any other country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March, it was able to test about 12,000 people per day in a round-trip system and that about 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by insurance if the examination is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to test 160,000 people per week.
19 On March the self-directed screening was conducted in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the number of people tested in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are published.
Initial clinical studies showed that during the week of 12/2020 a total of 483,295 samples had been tested by week 12/2020 with 33,491 (6.9%) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients at once, combining the samples and testing them again to see if any samples showed a positive result.In Wuhan, a 2000-sq-meter laboratory called "Huo-Yanmu" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) opened on 5 August 2020, with more than 10,000 samples available for operation.
The construction project was led by BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, and estimates suggest that Hubei's patient population would have increased by 47% and the cost of quarantining would have doubled had the testing facility not been built.
The Wuhan trial was followed quickly by Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the daily testing rate had reached 50,000. Multiplexed designs uncommercial systems developed by Origami Assays have been developed to test for COVID-19 in 1122 patient samples using only 93 tests. These designs can be used in small experiments without the need for robotic intervention.
By March, shortages of the test drug had become a major obstacle to high-value trials in the EU and the UK and US.
This has led some researchers to experiment with a process of preparing samples by heating them to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to extract RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates had tested its population for the coronavirus more than any other country, and was looking to expand testing to a larger population in the country.
This was achieved by combining the policy of self-testing in the testing centers, and the purchase of a mass-testing system from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" system of emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory, which was built in 14 days, has the capacity to process tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to operate outside of China.
Several test kits that target different parts of the coronavirus genome have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization recommended that a German company produce tests for developing countries that do not have the capacity to produce their own.
The German version was released on 17 January 2020; the version developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not released until 28 January, delaying testing in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the accuracy of the test equipment during the initial outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to produce enough of these devices to satisfy the demand and the healthcare professionals' approval for the test equipment.
In contrast, experts say that mass testing in South Korea helped to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, especially in proprietary laboratories, were built years ago by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, World Health recommended that testing systems be expanded as the most effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19.[107] The need for more rapid testing of the virus caused a shortage of testing in private facilities in the United States, and a shortage of testing materials and equipment.
In March 2020, China reported that there were problems with the reliability of their testing equipment.
In the United States, the CDC's test kits had a problem; the government removed barriers that had prevented private testing.Spain purchased the tests from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or to use the test accurately.
The Spanish Ministry of Health said it would withdraw negative tests, which were later confirmed by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of tests purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave negative results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million tests from China which were found to be negative.
Prime Minister Matovič said the tests would be dumped into the Danube.Most recently, Karaş of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the tests Turkey bought from China had "high potential for error" and "were not used".The UK had purchased 3.5 million tests from China but in early April 2020 announced that these could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those found to be infected and tracing of those who had been in close contact with those with SARS-CoV-2, was successful.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, conducted two tests on a total of 3,400 people, ten days apart.
Half of the infected people were asymptomatic, and all those who were infected were quarantined.
As they were not allowed to go out in public, the possibility of new infections was curtailed.
Close contact tracing, denial of entry, screening, and quarantine have helped to contain the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore more effectively than in other developed countries, but without shutting down many services such as food services and retail stores.
Many items were confiscated, and Singapore began telling citizens to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holiday on 23 March.
Many other countries have also managed to control the disease through contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but without the use of emergency measures, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have found that countries with high rates of infection, compared to high rates of death, have lower death rates, possibly because these countries are better able to detect those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing and testing capacity should send their initial five samples of COVID-19 patients and the first ten live samples to one of the 16 WHO-advised testing sites to confirm their testing.
Of the 16 studies studied, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the ratio Patients to % tested depends on the national testing system.
A country that tests only people who are assigned to hospital beds will have a higher percentage of patients tested than a country that tests the general population, whether symptomatic or not, if all other factors remain the same.
Hand washing, also known as finger hygiene, is the practice of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap and detergent at "special times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, including rabies, which are transmitted through oral contact.
People can also get the same type of infection as the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their face, nose, or mouth (i.e., sensitive areas).
The five most important times of the day to wash hands with soap are when it is most necessary to work: before going to or after leaving the toilet, after cleaning the baby's back or changing his diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and before or after preparing food or touching raw meat or fish.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with a hand sanitizer.
Before cooking, even if you are already done.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
I've just changed the carpet or cleaned the baby after going to the bathroom.
After you have your mouth, cheeks, or nose cleaned.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene is the hygiene of the hands related to medical care.
Hand washing before administering medication or treating a patient can reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to kill germs (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and to remove chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the healthcare field, but it is a good thing for everyone.
Hand washing has many benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; avoiding contaminants; reducing the incidence of infectious diseases;
and reduce child mortality in the home.
A 2013 study found that increasing hand washing habits may slightly improve growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the number of child deaths related to diarrhoea and seizures can be reduced by making behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap and detergent.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by as much as 50%.
Handwashing promotion can reduce congestion by up to a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to low-income communities.
A 48% reduction in infection can be attributed to handwashing with soap and water. Handwashing with soap and water is the most effective and inexpensive way of preventing infectious diseases, a practice that is practiced in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Diabetes, the most common disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together kill about 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap and water before eating and after using the toilet a common practice among people can save more lives than vaccination or treatment, reducing the mortality rate from malaria by a quarter of all deaths from respiratory diseases.
Hand washing is often accompanied by other hygiene practices as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) campaign.
Hand washing is also a prevention of the skin disease called plague which is spread by direct contact.
A small amount of regular hand washing can damage the skin of the face.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause skin irritation, redness, and inflammation, a condition called hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common in medical practice.
Frequent hand washing is also considered a symptom of a complex obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five key times of the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of oral infection: after using the toilet (sweeping, rinsing), after cleaning the baby (changing the toilet), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or touching raw meat or fish.
Other situations where proper hand washing is required to prevent the transmission of disease include before or after handling a fever or cold; after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after handling litter.
In many countries, hand-washing with soap is not common.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households used soap and handwashing. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest handwashing rates at 97 percent; the United States was at an average of 77 percent; and China was at the lowest 23 percent. There are currently many behavioral change programs to increase handwashing habits and soap in this critical time. Handwashing in groups of children at school is one of the most common practices in developing countries to improve handwashing behavior in children.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is one example of a program to improve the health and education of children.
Disinfection twice a year, such as hand washing with soap daily, daily tooth brushing and fluoride, are the cornerstones of the national agenda.
This system has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is supplemented by the addition of soap to water.
The main function of soap is to reduce water resistance, and thus to facilitate the washing process.
Water alone cannot make the skin grow because the fats and proteins, which are part of the natural soil, cannot be absorbed into the water.
Rather, the cleaning is aided by the flowing water.
Soap, because of its reuse, may retain some of the same bacteria from the previous use.
A small study on the transport of bacteria left on soap and butter showed that it is difficult to transport bacteria because of the way it travels through the intestines.
The CDC also stated that "a soap and water bath is best if it is not touched".
Health-conscious people are strongly advised to use antibacterial soaps.
At present, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or disinfectants kills germs.
Instead, disinfectant soaps contain antibiotics such as triclosan, which has a high concentration of antimicrobial agents.
Therefore, antibiotic-resistant soaps are not selected for their potency, nor do they work as well as advertised.
In addition to the skin-protective agent, the various chemical compounds it contains may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin-cleansing agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, herbal extracts). A major study from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that regular soap acts as a detergent against triclosan in preventing infection and removing germs from the hands.
The hot water that a person can wash his hands with is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Instead, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing the contamination of soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, recent scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not affect the number of bacteria on the fingers.
Hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990's and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand rubs (also called alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol by mixing a solid material such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) with a liquid, or a humectant such as glycerin with a liquid, or a solvent to make them more convenient for users and to reduce alcohol consumption.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide adds to its antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with less than 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers are effective against bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, compared to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hands after 30 seconds of use and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria in the hands after 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria but not effective against certain viruses.
Hand sanitizers made with alcohol are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, which is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in patients with the condition. Hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to rub or wipe both fingers.
The front and back of all fingers and the fingertips are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the water, foam or wax is dissolved.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed thoroughly, with both hands washed.The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over using hand sanitizer, especially if the fingers appear dirty.
The increased use of these devices is based on their ease of use and fast detoxification; however, they are not intended to replace the regular hand washing system unless soap and water are available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizers can cause skin irritation unless they are combined with lotions and/or moisturizers.
Skin irritation can be reduced or eliminated by adding sanitizer or other skin-friendly products.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based sanitizers mixed with skin moisturizers caused less skin irritation than soap or antibacterial soaps.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergic reactions to alcohol or alcohol-based sanitizers are rare.
The less severe irritant contact dermatitis has attracted attention compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Although effective, water-based hand sanitizers do not instantly clean hands, they only kill germs.
This is why sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water in fighting the spread of germs, as germs remain in the hands.
Non-alcoholic sanitizers are highly dependent on their contents, and historically they have not been as effective as alcohol-based sanitizers.
Recently, it was discovered that benzalkonium chloride-based products are more effective and more effective in killing bacteria when used, compared to alcohol, which was found to be less effective with increasing use, possibly due to its effects on the skin.
Many people in developing areas do not have access to soap, so they use mud and dirt.
Ash or soil may be more round than salt water, but it may not be as round as soap.
The problem is that contaminated soil or soil may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, dust is highly toxic because it reacts with water to form an alkaline solution.
WHO has approved the use of ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
Proper hand washing recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water before moving.
Flowing water is regulated because stagnant water can contain bacteria, whereas the temperature of the water makes no difference.
Bring a hand towel with a towel and a soap bar, including behind the fingers, in the glove, and under the fingers.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more effectively with soap than with plain water.
I bathed for at least 20 seconds.
Handwashing promotes the production of antifreeze, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and prolonged handwashing removes many bacteria.
Dip the fish in running water.
Soaking in stagnant water can cause re-infection of the fingers.
Dry your hands with a dry towel or leave them to dry.
Dry fingers quickly become infected with bacteria. The most neglected areas are the palate, the scrotum, the skin, and the stomach.
Famine pets and food can hide germs.
Moisturizers are recommended to protect the hands from irritation; dry skin can cause skin lesions which can increase the risk of infection.
There are many other ways to wash hands such as tap water or soap is not available to try to drain the water from a hanging toilet or a vacuum cleaner and/or use ashes if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water is scarce (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are measures to reduce water use, such as "tippy-taps" and other costly procedures.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique of using a small hand-held drill bit, which is held in the middle of the hand to draw a small amount of water and then apply it to the hands with a piece of soap.
Proper hand washing is an important part of finger cleaning, but there is some controversy over the best way to wash fingers in public restrooms.
Many studies say that paper towels are more effective than the electrical appliances found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the European Tissue Symposium, comparing the hygiene benefits of using paper towels, air-dried hand dryers and new jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and rinsing hands and breathing air, the number of bacteria was found to increase on the hands by 194% and on the hands by 254%.
Handwashing with high-pressure air caused a 42% increase in the number of bacteria on the hands and 15% on the feet.
After washing and rinsing hands with paper towels, the bacterial count was reduced on the hands by 76% and on the forearms by 77%.The scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a potential for the toilet to be contaminated with bacteria and the condition of the toilet area as a result of the different types of hand washing.
A high-speed air-conditioning system, which blows air at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), could blow the air from the hands and nose and could infect other toilet users and spread it to the toilet 2 metres away.
Using a cold air filter, the air blows the bacteria 0.25 meters away from the target.
Paper towels have not been shown to be capable of transmitting germs.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various handwashing techniques were studied.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after hand washing were found:
There are many hand washers, and hand washing has been compared to hand washing with paper towels.
Hand washing with a soft paper is used to go without soap and water.
Sanitizer containing alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing for the prevention of disease became mandatory long after the Austrian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of disease in hospitals.
Electronic devices are used to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
Some studies have found that infection rates decreased with the use of the device.
Hand washing to prevent infection takes at least 15 minutes, using soap and water to clean and wipe each area of the hand.
The arms should be joined with the fingers that are touching them.
If there is a contamination in the food, a small amount of the dangerous substance can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water that is handy, it is important to rinse thoroughly and wipe with clean towels.
After washing, a paper towel should be used to block water (and remove the drain if necessary).
This will prevent the fingers from becoming infected again.
The main benefit of hand washing in a hospital setting is to remove germs and avoid spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing is still a major problem in many hospitals, with many doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, potentially infecting them.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple steps can reduce blood-borne infections related to transplantation by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a paper recommending hand washing and hand rubbing in hospitals.
The guidelines are the signature of the foundation and can be found on its website for comments.
A thorough analysis was done by Whitby and his colleagues.
There are devices that can measure and verify the cleanliness, if necessary to ensure compliance with legal requirements.
The World Health Organization has identified "Five Conditions" for handwashing:
after contact with blood/ bodily fluid
I'm going to work on something that's not a germ, and
After contact with the patient. Adding an antimicrobial to a soap (medicated or antimicrobial) makes the soap more effective against bacteria.
Disinfecting may be necessary before the patient is treated or in the case of a highly contagious patient who is already familiar with antibiotics. To disinfect a patient, it is necessary to have a disposable tape that can be removed without touching the patient, washed with chlorhexidine or iodine, a towel boiled to wash the hands after washing, and a toothbrush with a special gel.
All the masks must be removed.
This requires washing the hands and the fingers from the palm to the elbow, for 26 minutes.
Longer (ten minutes) massage is not necessary.
During the stirring process, the water that is left on the hands should not be used to make the hands wet.
After washing the hands, the fingers are washed with a clean cloth and the cloth is then washed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is important to wash hands or use disinfectant before and after working with a patient.
To prevent staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand washing came from the first 20% of washing areas, and that the smallest benefit was obtained when the frequency of hand washing increased by more than 35%.
Washing with soap and water increases the risk of bacterial infection in food by more than three times compared to washing with antibacterial soap.Comparing hand sanitizer with alcohol and hand washing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds each showed that hand sanitizer with alcohol reduced the risk of bacterial infection by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizer in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands.Tips to promote hand hygiene in hospitals may include teaching staff about hand washing, supplementing with alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and providing written or verbal reminders to staff.
There is a need for further research into which of these approaches is most effective in different clinical situations.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap and water is seen as a cost-saving, health-enhancing, and nutritionally-improving technique.
However, the lack of water, soap or handwashing products in private homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge in promoting and implementing handwashing practices everywhere.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing mats are not available near any private or public toilets, although inexpensive methods of constructing hand-washing facilities are available.
However, hand washing in small quantities can also be a person's long-standing habit rather than lack of water and soap.
Advertising and promoting handwashing with soap can change the national policy, educate people about the benefits of handwashing and change people's lifestyle habits.
But this effective, monitoring and monitoring of people's activities is very important.
A study of 70 countries found that community-based policies in developing countries (LMICs) are effective in promoting handwashing; however, the marketing campaign is not.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach"; this approach involves encouraging schools to use simple and cost-effective methods to encourage students to wash their hands with soap, as part of a hygiene mandate.
When the basic standard is met, schools can go from one star to three stars.
The establishment of hand washing facilities can be one of the measures taken to reduce the number of diseases and child mortality.
Global Handwashing Day is also a good example of how to use this day to encourage behavioural change.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF created an online campaign to promote handwashing.
There are few studies that have examined the financial impact of handwashing in developed countries compared to the average of averted DALYs.
However, some observations suggest that the promotion of handwashing with soap may overshadow other water and sanitation practices.
The importance of handwashing to human health was first recognized in the mid-19th century by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, and by Florence Nightingale, the English "father of modern medicine".
At the time, it was believed that the disease was caused by a condition called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne illness and infectious disease caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study and educate the public on the importance of handwashing in preventing the spread of disease.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020 has led many countries to recognise the importance of hand washing with soap and detergent to prevent the spread of the aforementioned diseases.
For example, printed labels with phrases such as "correct hand washing techniques" have been found in hand washing toilets in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing one's hands" conveys the idea of one's renouncing responsibility or involvement in a matter.
The phrase is from the Bible in Matthew where we find Pontius Pilate washing his hands over the decision to crucify Jesus Christ; however, the expression is now commonly used in English speaking areas.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her hands while trying to recall her thoughts, symbolizing the guilt she felt over her crimes and the time she had to leave.
It has also been observed that when people remember or remember bad things they have done, they tend to wash their hands more often than others, and they tend to respect handwashing appliances more than they did before.
Additionally, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a brief consideration may not be able to participate in other hygienic practices such as self-cleaning.
Religions encourage hand washing both as a means of purification and as a symbol.[1] Symbolic hand washing, i.e. the use of water without soap to wash hands, is one of the few hand washing practices practiced in several religions, including Bahai, Hindu, Tevilah and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.[2] Religions also encourage hand washing especially after certain rituals.
Hindu, Jewish and Muslim faiths encourage hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims all advocate hand washing before and after eating.
Preventing work-related disruptions due to COVID-19
The workplace safety measures related to COVID-19 include the implementation of risk prevention and risk management measures for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The best workplace prevention practices are based on the location and type of work performed and the challenges are determined by identifying the source of risk, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk to individual workers and workers who are most susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have less contact with the outside world and other workers, and such risks can be mitigated with basic health care, encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick, breathing habits, and efforts to regularly clean and disinfect the workplace.
Low-risk occupations include those that involve close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may become infected due to local transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who have contact with other people, such as schools, crowded workplaces, and busy shopping areas.
Prevention of such risks in the community involves the adoption of basic preventive measures, including the use of respirators, and wearing personal protective clothing if a COVID-19 patient is in the vicinity.
OSHA policy is to take into account the healthcare professionals and personnel working in facilities that handle suspected COVID-19 cases because they are at high risk, and that risk is exacerbated when these workers collect samples from a deceased or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Safety measures for these workers include building building safety measures, such as air-tight doors from one room to another, and appropriate personal hygiene equipment for the workplace.
The COVID-19 lockdown can result in many types of work disruptions.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of contracting the disease.
The market can change, depending on the products people want and the way they buy those products (e.g. buying at the lowest price or preferring to deliver the goods they need or staying in the car when they arrive at the point of sale).
Finally, the transportation of goods from COVID-19-affected areas may be disrupted. Preparedness for the spread of the disease and management of the disease is necessary to help guide the response efforts.
The plans consider the risk factors associated with different workplaces as well as the specific workplace, including the effects of infectious diseases, risks from home and community, and other risk factors such as age or chronic illness.
They establish the necessary restrictions to deal with the threat, and the prevention plan for the eventuality of an outbreak.
Prevention of infectious diseases may depend on national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of controlling outbreaks are to reduce the spread of disease among the workforce, to protect people at risk of contracting the disease and serious injury, to maintain the normal flow of work, and to minimize the impact on those with whom businesses interact in the performance of their services.
The prevalence of disease in the community is increasingly affecting the way we fight it.
Risk management is a widely used approach in the world of work and health to manage risk by simplifying processes based on the best available knowledge.
The most important prevention measures for COVID-19 are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally, individual prevention measures.
Engineering controls involve the removal of the work-related constraints without reliance on work ethic and are therefore less expensive to implement.
Administrative controls are changes to the work process or work environment that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective for the initial diagnosis or management but can help prevent infection.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, should be properly stored and maintained (e.g. washed), worn regularly and properly, should be regularly inspected, maintained, repaired, removed, and disposed of as necessary, cleaned, and stored or disposed of for disease prevention.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs involve fewer interactions with outside workers.
Basic precautions for all workplaces include hand washing and proper cleaning, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, proper grooming practices including covering the mouth when cleaning or sneezing, giving people toilet paper and hand sanitizing paper, being prepared to talk on the phone or switch jobs if necessary, encouraging workers not to use their colleagues' tools, and cleaning the work area regularly and disinfecting.
Early detection and isolation of suspected cases helps to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever has subsided, the symptoms of malaria have resolved, and the symptoms have subsided for at least 24 hours without using a tranquilizer and that workplace restraint policies be flexible, allow home-based care, and that employees be familiar with these policies.
According to OSHA, low-risk work is work that requires people to maintain a physical contact distance of less than six feet (1.8 m) from people who are not known to have or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the workplace in the past month or because the person has traveled abroad to a known COVID-19 site.
This includes workers who have contact with other people such as in schools, crowded workplaces, and contaminated shopping areas.Prevention of engineering controls at these locations and high-risk groups includes installing high-efficiency air filters on buildings, increasing the size of the building, installing a safety barrier such as a mask, and installing a window for people to buy into the car to be tested.Administrative controls on the workplace to ensure that workers are properly protected and sanitized during COVID-19 pandemic, coordinated workplace safety measures to encourage COVID-19 prevention and preparedness, and the ability to plan for COVID-19-related emergencies, to provide workers with the necessary training, to provide appropriate vaccinations, to provide information to workers, to provide training, to provide training, to provide training, to provide training, to train, to provide information to others, to provide training, to provide training, to provide training, to provide training, to provide training, to provide training, to provide to provide to the public, to provide to the public, to provide to the public, to provide to the public, to the public, to the public, to the public, to the public, to the public, to the community, to the community, and to the public.
Workers in this group of patients rarely need to use respirators.
If someone is sick on a flight, good prevention measures for staff and passengers include keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others, having a staff member attend to the sick person, giving the sick person a mask or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with sanitary napkins when they cough or sneeze.
Airline staff should wear disposable masks when handling a sick passenger or contacting a body fluid or a contaminated object, and should wash their hands if a passenger appears to have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be stored in a biohazard bag, and the container should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. Freight ships, including passenger ships, avoid these hazards, extend the journey if you are sick, isolate yourself and inform the crew if you experience fever or other symptoms while on board.
In fact, monitoring of the patient should be done in the patient's isolation room.In schools and daycare centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure of the facility for cleaning and disinfection if the patient has been in the school building even if the area has not been contaminated.
In the case of a community-wide outbreak, self-isolation techniques may be used, such as cancelling outings, school queues, and other large gatherings such as gymnastic or choir parties or school lunch, increasing student seating, changing the arrival and departure times of students, reducing the number of unnecessary travellers, and using a separate health office for children with the most severe symptoms.
In the event of a severe outbreak in the community, the precautionary measures should be increased to include a prolonged closure of schools.For public safety personnel engaged in daily activities, the risk of infection is considered very low by the CDC.
Security personnel who have had contact with people with confirmed COVID-19 are advised to follow the same procedures as emergency medical personnel, including the use of full body hygiene.
If contact occurs after an arrest, the workers should clean and disinfect their clothes before reuse using household spray or fumigation, and follow all known procedures for cleaning toilets and washing clothes.
OSHA considers some health care workers and facility workers to be at high risk of infection.
The most high-risk occupations are home healthcare, advocacy, testing, and medical personnel who have contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are particularly at risk when workers are involved in aerosol-generating procedures, or when they are exposed to samples from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Aerosol-generating procedures include respiratory, bronchoscopy, dental procedures, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk work on the cadaver is the preparation of the bodies of people who were known to have or were suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these are at particular risk when performing autopsies.Engineering controls for these high-risk groups include the use of isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 cases, where aerosol-generating procedures have been used.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be useful in certain medical conditions and for the handling of cadavers.
Human samples should be handled with the utmost care (Biosafety Level 3 precautions).
WHO recommends that newly infected patients be isolated by air-conveyance if suspected of having COVID-19.In addition to other PPE standards, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work within 6 feet of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and those who work on aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, N95 vaccines that are NIOSH-approved or better must be used in a controlled environment including pre-testing, operator training, training, and clinical trials.
Other types of masks can be more effective and help to reassure workers as they do their jobs. WHO does not recommend using the mask because COVID-19 is a viral infection and is not transmitted through body urine.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks for isolation.
For those who are collecting blood samples from people, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without using aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of a mask, a face mask, and a glove.
During the aerosol-generating procedure, the mask used for cleaning is covered with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE), WHO recommends limiting the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when providing telehealth care, the use of distractions such as remote controls, allowing only direct care providers access to the COVID-19 patient's room, using only personal protective equipment necessary for the procedure, using a single contact lens when treating patients with certain medical conditions, monitoring and controlling the use of personal protective equipment, and not allowing the use of masks for asymptomatic patients.

WHO: [Covid-19] Reducing workload and preparing for the future
The following is the list of all stations by UTC time: as of 12 January 2020 (UTC+2).
CC0: No rights reserved
We are in a difficult situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly shown us that all people in the world are connected and have responsibilities to each other.
We have no precedent for this challenge, but we know that our response will depend on the global empathy, cooperation, and solidarity of the people on whom this institution is built.
The warmth and concern we have seen in the e-mails, phone calls, and phone calls is evidence that our associates are caring and friendly.
I can't thank my friends enough.
Last week, someone thanked me for my work.
It reminded me of the importance of the world turning to Wikipedia at this time, and that this is a powerful sign that Wikipedia is valuable and should be available online for everyone to visit.
Your work helps us achieve this success, by helping to maintain the website, by helping to pay our employees or by helping to keep our customers safe.
The world needs Wikipedia's information now more than ever.
It is a time when we realize that our actions and attitudes have a direct effect on the world.
In view of the importance of this dedication and your work on this matter, we will be making some adjustments to our schedule starting next week.
Adjustment in our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the committee met last night to discuss our policy and our schedule to be followed in the coming days and months.
In our presentation, we talked about what we think is the best way to prepare for the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization running in the present time.
We all wanted to be free of pressure and to support our cause for a long time.
If you want to hit again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and temporary workers:
We are looking at 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until we can make a change.
We don't need a vacation  If you can work more than that, the department can use you.
But in this uncertain world, whether you want to care for a loved one, shop for a home, or seek medical attention, we want you to be healthy.
We are not going to keep track of your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This is not a topic that we would have liked to discuss, but we felt it was worth discussing.
Sick leave or paid leave is not required  simply inform your supervisor and help your coworkers to make changes to your work schedule to ensure that all scheduled work is done.
(If you are tested positive for COVID-19, inform Bryan at T&amp;C Ops so T&amp;C can provide you with the necessary support and will work to ensure that you are well and receive the necessary support from our leadership).
Those who worked the full hour would be paid in full.
We have already said, and we reiterate here, that we will honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly co-workers.
Each person will be paid according to his or her normal hours under normal circumstances.
This includes taking time off when you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means to relieve stress from the people/things around them.
Our efforts are rewarding and productive especially at a time like this.
Again, it is up to you to take care of yourself.
We simply ask that you discuss with your employer what we can expect and make adjustments if necessary.
Some jobs are considered to be of special importance.
Some things do not stand.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Wellness, and the selection teams (etc.) perform a variety of tasks that require additional support.
We will begin the process of reviewing our current motives and focusing on what we are now in order to support the most important of our actions.
We have a lot to do, we just need to focus on more important projects.
Slowing down will not affect our future.
We do not plan to work overtime to compensate for the loss of a job or to avoid delays.
You are not expected to work longer hours than you would have otherwise because of an unreasonable amount of work.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we are willing to adjust our goals and priorities as needed.
What will be done on the Annual Planning?
To change the way we live, and the expected time in our daily routine, we hope to change the days of the week to the desired goals in our 2020-2021 Year Plan.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 schedule to allow more time to work on the budget so that staff can prioritize their priorities, take care of themselves, and their people while also considering those who want to work part-time in the next few weeks.
This increase significantly reduces the current workload and the ability to complete current workload across the department.
We will present our proposals to the Governing Body next week and will inform delegates and others of the changes that need to be made once we have confirmed them.
Thank you all for your organization and leadership in all matters.
Office environment, plumbing and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues in San Francisco appeared to be infected with COVID-19.
Instead, with great care, we obtained a disinfectant and sprayed the entire space and equipment in the San Francisco office.
They used disinfectant used in hospitals to disinfect everything, from the infected area, to the elevator stacks that reach the floor of our office.
The owners of the building also used their own methods to take care of their employees.
We feel secure that the office will be in good order when we decide to return to work.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, and the facility has been informed of its COVID-19 response plan and all staff members have been informed of the plan.
By the end of last week, our DC office was moved to a more remote location following the inspiration of San Francisco.
And as some of our friends in NYC know, we've been dating and renting a place in Brooklyn.
This courtship is a process that can be resisted.
Some of our colleagues are working from home for the first time.
Some of our longtime associates recognize that it is a challenge, and they would like to offer some suggestions:
Let the eggs cook for one to two hours.
If longer meetings are necessary, discuss how the meetings can be rescheduled to different dates.
Each committee sets out its own agenda, makes recommendations and discusses the issues that need to be studied in advance.
Prioritize your video by using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to help with this ongoing conversation.
Have someone lead each meeting, someone monitor the discussions and questions and give time and monitor who is speaking and who is doing the talking (or check in and do the talking).
If you need earplugs, email the technician for a better earplugs.
Use the refund to keep the purple color.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack and chat with your colleagues about the tasks you've been given
The Department of Human Resources is looking into the topic of webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the work of the Department as a whole.
In the past week, we have asked donors to cancel all Wikimedia funded events such as editathons, until the WHO has confirmed that I will be available again.
We explained that we fully understand that asking them to cancel or restrict certain activities makes it difficult to carry out some of the plans they have made and that no one will be penalized for delaying or changing the plans.
During the next week, we will be tracking other inspiration on Wikimania and on the political classroom and elsewhere.
What we see most of all in our colleagues around the world is that our colleagues are saddened by such a loss but are also shocked when they realize that they have to devote themselves to the interests of their community, Wikimedia and so on.
In the future, CRT is working hard to create a Meta-Wiki to allow people to track their interactions and follow our communications.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will be calling you through your calendars to a special meeting next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to talk about other matters, to answer your questions and to have a brief discussion.
This is a matter that involves all of us, and we should all help one another in any way we can.
This information is available on email and other COVID-19 related information sites, and on Office Wiki.
The CRT will attempt to store the latest data in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff in the most affected communities at this time.
If you have any questions about transportation, events, any project or challenge to fulfill your work commitments, or anything else you need help with, please feel free to let us know and contact the CRT.
We are always ready to help and cooperate with you on the necessary issues.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
All these changes are not meant to seem as if they would change our work and responsibilities.
Rather, it helps us to recognize that at this time our roles and responsibilities may need to be adjusted to a degree that is different from what we have experienced in the past.
These steps are believed to be necessary to support one another in order to keep us functioning, supporting our organization in any way necessary, and serving the people and the ministry on which it is based.
The tasks we have planned will be there for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to help one another and to set aside time for the most important activities that will take place in the weeks and months ahead.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can be in good shape when we need you.
Now, I'm not touching your face!
The following are the names of the members of the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the other leaders (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The body's b-component angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a substance that binds to the surface (cell surface) of cells in the tissues, muscles, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II that increases Ang{1-7) making it a potential target for use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.ACE2 also acts as a target for cell-mediated immunity against certain coronaviruses.
In humans, this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The active ingredient of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of blood cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a transdermal patch, with its main effects manifested on the surface of cells in the joints and other tissues.
The ACE2 receptor is then transported to the skin by a chemical called sheddase, where the protein is washed off into the blood and then injected into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most tissues: ACE2 is found in most tissues, especially in the skin of cells of the secondary red blood cells, the skin of the small intestine, the blood vessels and nerves, and the nerves of the kidneys.
The ACE2 mRNA is also found in the membranes that cover the brain, the brain stem, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main benefit of ACE2 is to improve ACE
ACE binds to the angiotensin I hormone by vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 then binds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is subsequently converted to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to a variety of receptors including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is suspected to be a factor in Hartnup disease.
As a protein transported on the skin, ACE2 acts as a key entry portal to the immune system for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the interaction of the spike protein S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 supernatant on the surface of the cell causes the absorption of the virus and the spores from their original location and back into the cell membranes.
This intervention also requires the activation of the S protein by the serine protease TMPRSS2, the effectiveness of which is being studied for clinical use.This has led some to speculate that reducing the ACE2 level in the cell, may help to reduce the risk of infection.
However, various research groups and regulatory agencies support the continued use of the common ACE inhibitor alongside ARB therapy.
A detailed review of the results of the clinical trial published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was 34% more effective in reducing risk of pneumonia than the controlled therapies
In general, "the risk of asthma was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at increased risk of asthma, especially those with depression and cardiovascular disease
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been shown to reduce the mortality rate of influenza, although the effect is not as severe as the risk of influenza".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered to be the most effective treatment for chronic respiratory depression, and was shown to improve neural connectivity and respiratory function in young rats with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The decrease in rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the operation starts in 30 minutes with a maximum duration (time to complete) of 24 hours.
Findings from several studies suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising therapy for those who are intolerant of classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with increased angiotensin II release.Infused rhACE2 is being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of renal-related disorders.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps developed to help monitor contacts during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. to isolate people (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various apps have been developed or recommended, with official government support in various states and provinces.
Various methods of building apps that track contacts of patients have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, particularly with regard to applications based on tracking where users are.
Other unusual methods of wireless communication include using Bluetooth waves to connect a user's phone to a nearby phone.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would jointly support Bluetooth apps in Android and iOS directly on their mobile devices.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipau, has developed an app that allows citizens to test for COVID-19 in people they have been in contact with.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, the TraceTogether app is used.
The app was developed by local IT specialists, developed for public use and will be funded by the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth app to track the presence of people with suspected illnesses and send instant messages to healthcare providers and authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
It was released on April 14, 2020, as an app by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that a contact tracing app was in the final stages of development, and would be available within a few weeks.A similar app is being developed in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, identified potential problems with app-based systems, including the possibility of poor performance and vulnerability if the app is used by multiple users.
To address the issue of harmful or dangerous coronavirus apps, Apple has restricted the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, allowing only those that are "corporate" or "recognized".
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Advocates expressed concern about the potential impact of mass tracking of coronavirus apps, especially questioning whether the tracking built for the virus would be effective once the epidemic was over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have passed a resolution calling for restrictions on the monitoring process.
The agencies announced eight restrictions on government projects:
monitoring should be legal, necessary and proportionate;
The extension of monitoring and monitoring shall include a statement indicating when it will end;
The information will be used for COVID-19-related purposes only;
the protection of data and confidentiality shall be protected and this shall be evidenced by evidence;
computer monitoring should avoid further aggravation of issues related to racism and discrimination;
the sharing of information with third parties must be regulated by law;
there should be policies to prevent human rights violations and the right of citizens to defend themselves when they are attacked;
"Clear participation" of all "affected" will be required, including social workers and groups of affected people.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also called for action.
The Google/Apple joint initiative aims to solve the problem of unnecessary tracking by disabling tracking on their devices when it is not needed.
Some countries have introduced mobile phone tracking in place of apps, preventing the download of apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, phone tapping is legal.
Telephone tracking systems that provide information about the exact location of a person are a serious threat to the security of the network.
However, not all hosts with shared servers need to be able to identify the user's location; several privacy-preserving hosts are set up as shared servers used for internal communication.
In South Korea, an app-based system is being used to track contacts of infected patients
Instead of using a standalone app, the system collects data from multiple sources including phone tracking and credit card information, and combines them to record and send messages to the phone to people suspected of having been infected.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts of the infected, government and public information about where the infected person is located is publicly available, which was made possible by changes to the vaccination law after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through various apps and websites.Germany's federal states are considering using a shared system with privacy protections.
6 As of April 2020, the uniforms have not yet been released.
Contact tracing is a well-developed technology, which has been the subject of numerous studies since 2013.On 7 April 2020, several teams of experts worked on improving the security of mobile devices, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to determine the user's location relative to other devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a collaborative protocol that includes a number of protocols, and does not follow a single rule. The rules that are included include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, aka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) among others.
In this policy, the trace data is not removed from the device, and all contact is made there.
The MIT Media Lab research team has developed SafePaths, a methodology for using data security techniques to analyze and use a data-minimization platform to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the report "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar system is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a security technology company that was originally based at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace builds secure technologies to enable users to share confidential location and health information with other users and administrators, without compromising privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Coalition launched a network of groups using the same platform and shared rules, with the aim of reducing the number of groups, and to be able to collaborate to develop apps for tracking and messaging, a key factor in enabling greater participation and engagement.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it was deploying the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 June 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a new contact tracing system, which they said will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption using signals.
They also published information on the proprietary technology used in the spice.
According to Apple and Google, the product is expected to be released in three phases:
release of a protocol that allows the government to develop an app for coronavirus surveillance agencies but with privacy restrictions.
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android applications Google and Apple are working to resolve the issue of allowing and monitoring the content when it is first shared via the app's mobile app, and later removing it when the threat is resolved.
Drug repositioning (also called re-use, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the re-use of a drug to treat a disease or condition that is different from the original target.
This is one of the most advanced scientific studies currently being pursued to develop a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other follow-up studies include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has 66 vaccine-derived proteins, each of which contains several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites is helping to develop vaccines against the COVID-19 proteins.
The major target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the papain-like protease, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, the S protein, and the ADP ribophosphatase.

The COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine to fight the 2019 (COVID-19) disease.
While no drug has yet reached clinical trials, there are several attempts to develop such a drug.
In late February 2020, WHO said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available in the market in less than 18 months.
The five-dose vaccine was in Phase I testing in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The flu pandemic spread across the world in 2020, prompting significant investment in research to develop a vaccine.
Many agencies are using the published genomes to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The trial began in May, the key requirements for CEPI's efforts to develop a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capability, production of the required vaccine quantity and global distribution.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technologies were in R&D by 2020 to begin developing a vaccine for COVID-19.
The main sources of information that came to the Phase I risk assessment include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Developer of Phase I and the vaccine driver: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Developer of Phase I and target drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 targeted vaccines were in the early-stage of development, 78 were confirmed as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but with no clear data on them (believed to be in development or in clinical trials).
Phase I-II clinical trials include preliminary risk assessment and vaccine testing, including early surveillance, including the use of a vaccine, conducted at multiple sites, as well as determining the most effective dose.
Phase III trials involve multiple participants with a control group to test the effectiveness of the drug against disease, while monitoring the effects of using higher doses.
Of the 79 targeted vaccines in development (approved in April 2020 for launch), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (still at "preclinical trials").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is developing a molecular clamp vaccine that could genetically modify viral proteins and thus prevent the spread of the virus.

In March 2020, the US government, three companies, and universities selected resources to acquire cloud computing from IBM, in addition to cloud computing products from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a number of side effects, which are known as side effects.
This means it can be more effective than simply preventing disease.
Another randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines that are being developed may be harmless or ineffective.
Early studies to evaluate the safety of vaccines using animal models for COVID-19, such as ACE2-positive mice, experimental animals, and other animals, indicate the need for biosafety-level 3 prevention strategies to address the health virus, and for collaboration at the global level to ensure that the products are safe.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animals.
As of 2020, no cure or vaccine for SARS has been found to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development and development of new vaccines and treatments for SARS was a priority for governments and health organizations around the world. However, no vaccine has been approved for MERS.
When MERS first emerged, it was thought that the existing SARS research could provide valuable information on which to base the development of vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was only one (DNA-based) vaccine that had passed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more in development, collectively known as viral-vectored vaccines, including two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
There are rumours circulating on the Internet that the COVID-19 virus was already known and that a vaccine had already been developed.
The innovations mentioned in various media outlets refer to the development of a drug to treat rheumatism and other respiratory illnesses caused by the coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include a runny nose, pain in the nose, runny nose, tingling in the throat, difficulty in smelling, and abdominal pain.
The time from infection to onset of symptoms is usually around five days but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most patients present with mild symptoms, some develop severe epilepsy and have paralysis of the extremities.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been identified in 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. Mostly the virus is spread by people in close contact, mainly through human urinary, urinary or oral secretions.
Of course, the gas that comes out of a person's breathing air, often falls on the ground or on objects, and does not affect people who are far away.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face, nose, or mouth.
The virus can remain on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is usually diagnosed within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it can be diagnosed when symptoms are not present even in the later stages of the disease. The most commonly used method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) by removing a pore from the urine.
It is recommended to use masks on those suspected of being infected and their caregivers.
The use of cannabis in public is permitted, while some authorities prohibit, some approve and others have imposed restrictions on its use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or cure for COVID-19.
The intra-community spread of the disease has been observed in several different countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected may not experience symptoms or experience the symptoms of influenza such as fever, chills, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Urgent symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain, dizziness, difficulty walking and facial or oral flushing; it is advisable to seek emergency medical attention if these symptoms persist.
Less common symptoms include, upper respiratory symptoms such as a cough, runny nose or a runny nose.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported in varying degrees.
Initially, some patients in China will first feel a heavy weight on their chest and a throbbing in their thighs.
In some cases, the disease progresses to the point of seizures, paralysis, and death.
This is called the period of transubstantiation.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually between five and six days but can be longer, ranging from 2 to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days of being infected.Reports suggest that not all infected people develop symptoms spontaneously.
The role of asymptomatic individuals in transmitting disease is not yet fully understood; however, the available data suggest that they may be more susceptible to disease.
The proportion of asymptomatic patients is currently unknown and is being investigated, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of the patients who were vaccinated were asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began counting asymptomatic cases among daily patients on 1 August; of the 166 patients reported on that day, 130 patients (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.
The leaves and stems can be completely contaminated with bacteria.
Shouting is more likely to cause diarrhea than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that if a person licks his lips without covering it, he will produce a puddle that will sink 4.5 meters (15 feet) deep.
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences reports that bioaerosol transmission is possible and that airborne contaminants outside human dwellings have been detected in samples containing RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may involve the emission of particles that are dispersed into the air and thus result in airborne infections.
While there is concern that the disease may be spread through contact with the infected, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is most commonly found in patients who are symptomatic; although the infection may occur when symptoms are not present, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while the spread of disease is slow, on average, one person infects two to three others.The virus spends between one hour and one day on surfaces.
In particular, the virus has been shown to survive for one day on a carpet, three days on a plastic (polypropylene) and a plastic (AISI 304) surface, and four hours on a 99% copper surface.
Rather, this time varies according to the air hole and temperature.
Soaps and detergents also work well when used properly; soap products remove the protective skin layer, neutralize and remove any skin pigment and debris.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a disinfectant used in personal care), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, human fecal samples were collected at a rate of two days after bed-wetting.
Of the six cases, the first sample showed a high level of bacteria and the sixth patient showed a high level of bacteria on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first identified in three patients with cholera as a variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus identified in patients in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in all the viruses that are resistant to coronaviruses in the genome.
When the virus is outside the body and in contact with soap, the soap will release the virus virus that is outside. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
The lungs are the most susceptible to COVID-19 because the virus enters the cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is mainly expressed in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special membrane glycoprotein called "thorn" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute myocardial infarction was found in 12% of patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, due to systemic inflammatory response and impaired circulation during the disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are found mainly in the heart and are involved in the cardiovascular system.
A rare combination of blood clotting (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been found in COVID-19 patients requiring multiple treatments and may be associated with a false diagnosis.Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 have revealed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including the presence of non-vascular blood clots in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is activated by ACE2-containing epithelial cells, patients with fatal COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Most notably, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have been observed in autopsies.
WHO is developing a research platform for many of these diseases.
The most common test is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on samples taken from the nose and obtained with a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a biopsy can also be used.
Results are usually obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used but the samples must be taken twice from the person in two weeks intervals and the results are not usually useful in an emergency.
Chinese scientists identified the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that tests could be conducted worldwide, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.
As of 4 April 2020, immunoassay testing (which can detect disease in the body or in a person's history) was in development, but not yet widely used.
Testing experience in China has shown that the accuracy of the test is only between 60 to 70% percent.
The US FDA approved the first point-of-care test for use on 21 March 2020 later that month.The test guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University included recommendations for a diagnostic strategy based on the characteristics and epidemiological risk of the disease.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
This may occur as a result of progressive subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation.
The limited data on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 is limited.
The key findings of the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema is also seen
Four aggressive strains of the virus-borne pneumonia are being investigated:
moderate swelling: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe depression: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD has been associated with severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
treatment of pneumonia: or a combination of pneumonia and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the chances of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining a healthy breathing pattern and avoiding touching the face, nose or mouth before washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth, nose, and throat whenever you cough or sneeze and removing your hand when you sneeze or cough if you are not covered.
Careful hand washing after stretching or cupping is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public, with one goal in mind to avoid transmission of the disease, especially in patients with mild symptoms.Self-isolation measures aim to limit contact between infected people and large groups of people, such as school closures and workplace restrictions, movement restrictions, and cancellation of public gatherings.
The rules are to be followed to avoid long distances and include the requirement that people throw 6 feet (1.8 meters).
There is no known vaccine against COVID-19.The most urgent time for a vaccine to appear is in 2021, when the strategy to combat COVID-19 is to try to slow the spread of the disease, called "pre-vaccination".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if the fingers are noticeably sore, before eating and after spitting, sneezing or coughing.
The agency also recommends using a sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only if soap and water are not available.In areas where sanitizers are not available, the WHO recommends two methods of application.
In this process, the active ingredient is either ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "a hand antisepsis agent".
Glycerol is added to produce a humectant.
People are treated with supportive care, which may include water, oxygen, and supporting the affected organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they have the virus wear a mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory distress, but the efficacy of this procedure is still under investigation.
Personal hygiene and health care and nutrition are recommended to enhance the health of the individual.
Emergency treatment may help those with mild symptoms when the disease is first diagnosed.WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled recommendations from various agencies and posted them in the open source database, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no treatment for COVID-19 has been found.
In treating symptoms, some specialists recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen as the first-line drug.
Care should be taken to reduce the risk of infection, especially in hospitals where there are procedures that can cause infection such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For physicians treating patients with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the patient in an air-conditioned isolation room (AIIR) that includes the use of routine precautions, contact precautions, and air-conditioning precautions.The CDC recommends the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in an emergency.
The most commonly used cosmetics are: a scarf, a scarf, a mask, a face mask, and a medical glove. If there are two, the cosmetics (rather than the mask) are preferred.
N95 injection is recommended for industrial use but the FDA has authorized emergency use of the injection (EUA).
They are designed to protect the wearer from airborne particles such as dust, but the high level of protection against germs is not guaranteed in improper use.
If a surgical mask is not available, the CDC recommends that if there is no surgical tool, a homemade surgical mask may be used.
Most COVID-19 patients are not sufficiently young to be vaccinated, but there is a high demand for vaccines.
The type of nasal protection required for people with COVID-19 infection in respiratory care is being studied especially for people in the hospital setting, and there is some information that nasal re-implantation can be avoided with the use of a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether any of these have the same beneficial effects on terminally ill patients.
Some physicians prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique reduces the particle emission compared to high flow nasal cannula. The most severe cases are seen in older people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds for their population, limiting the capacity of hospitals to respond to an outbreak of COVID-19 and requiring all beds.
A study in China found that 5% were hospitalized for non-surgical treatment, 2.3% required mechanical assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients in hospitals are admitted to intensive care units (ICU).
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more common because the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with COVID-19 and respiratory distress is becoming more common.
Ventilators that can respond to respiration with high PEEP are needed to provide adequate oxygen while also reducing the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be on older machines.
A clinical trial of a possible treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently being used.
Remdesivir is the one that seems to hold out hope.
While new drug development may be delayed until 2021, other experimental drugs have already been approved for use in other diseases and are currently in advanced clinical trials.
Antiviral medication may be tested in patients with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in clinical trials of new drugs to determine their safety and efficacy.The FDA has granted temporary approval for convalescent plasma as a treatment option in situations where a person's life is at risk.
It has not yet been tested to determine whether it is safe and effective in diagnosing or treating the disease.
In March 2020, China launched a mobile app to help monitor the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect 'close contacts' using tracking information, thus helping to detect potential infection threats.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
In the event of a suspected outbreak, the app not only recommends quarantining, but also alerts local health authorities.Big data analytics on mobile phone data, eye tracking technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track cases and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed agencies to monitor cell phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
This was done to strengthen the quarantine measures and to protect those who may have come into contact with those who have been infected.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a government agency that tracks and monitors the spread of the disease.
Russia has developed a sophisticated technology to detect those who have fled the country.
Giulio Gallera, the head of Italy's Ministry of Health, said he was informed by mobile phone that "40% of the population is still on the move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Similarly, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called on the world to develop various measures to combat the coronavirus.
Individuals may be self-hating because of the Valentine's Day, restricted mobility, impaired healthcare or fear of contracting a disease.
BBC reported Rory O'Connor made the following statement, "Increasing isolation, loneliness, frustration, pressure and economic isolation, are disturbing the mind and the quality of life of the people".
The disease can be mild and cause little or no symptoms, similar to other commonly encountered high-risk infections such as the common cold.
Mild symptoms usually resolve in about two weeks, while severe or chronic symptoms may take three to six weeks to resolve.
Women who are overweight may be at increased risk for COVID-19 from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data on COVID-19 in this regard is not yet available.In humans, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause diarrhea.
For those who are severely affected, COVID-19 can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
The most common symptoms associated with COVID-19 include organ failure (sepsis), abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Increased blood clotting, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while renal complications were observed in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes, transaminases.
According to the same report, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was ten days after ten days spent in hospital beds.
However, patients in intensive care units (ICU) had a median seven-day delay in hospital admission and death.
In early case studies, the average duration of the onset of symptoms and death was between 14 days and 6 to 41 days.
In a survey by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for males was 2.8% and for males it was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of the dead samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage as well as cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The patient's symptoms were similar to those of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of deaths reported to the National Health Commission of China, cardiac arrest is considered to have higher rates of cardiac arrest (troponin or cardiac arrest).
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had a pre-existing medical condition.Local healthcare and economic conditions can also contribute to the mortality rate.
Estimates of the death toll vary because of regional differences, but also because of the severity of the earthquake.
Underestimating the number of people who are not seriously ill could result in an overestimation of the death toll.
Rather, the fact that deaths are those of people who have had the disease in the past could mean that the death rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require emergency medical care or die compared to non-smokers.There is a concern for those with other medical conditions.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a reduction in liver function of between 20% and 30% in some patients who recovered from the disease and a lung scan showed a decrease.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether newly diagnosed infections provide a better prognosis for patients who recover from the disease.
The possibility is uncertain, based on the behaviour of the other coronavirus, but patients who recovered from COVID-19 were later tested positive for the coronavirus.
The patient is thought to have developed a secondary disease, not a recurrence.
The virus is believed to be a natural and animal-borne infection that spreads from animals to humans (spillover infection).
The exact source is unknown, but by December 2019 the transmission of the disease was focused on human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 first confirmed COVID-19 patients, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed that the first symptoms appeared on 1 December 2019.
Official data from WHO stated that the first symptoms were detected on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These rates vary from region to region and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of care, available treatments, time since the disease has been present and other demographic factors such as age, age and overall health status.
As of late 2019, WHO has assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for test-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for test-confirmed deaths from COVID-19 without test-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global death and disease rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case-fatality rate (CFR), a measure of the percentage of cases that die from the disease, and the infection rate (IFR), a measure of the number of cases (re-tested and re-tested) that die from a particular disease.
These statistics are non-clockwise and follow a population from the time of the initial infection to the end of the infection (survival or death).
While not all infected people receive immunizations, having immunizations can give us information about the number of people who have been infected.
In Italy, the worst outbreak was in the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, where 4,600 people died, 80 (1.7%) of whom were children.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through the Carnival festival, where it infected young people, a few people died and not everyone who died from COVID-19 was reported to have died.
Also, hospitals in Germany are not overburdened with patients.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as shown in blood transfusions.
69 (population 0.004%) confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The frequency of seizures and the rate of death varies between men and women.
Mostly, men are the ones who die according to surveys in China and Italy.
The highest risk is in men, in their 50s, and the average age of men and women is in their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of this difference in sex is unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Differences in mortality based on age, less smoking among women and men having different diseases such as epilepsy at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher male mortality rate.
In Europe, 57% of cases were male and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government was not tracking gender data in COVID-19 patients.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most nurses, especially nurses, are women, meaning they have a better chance of being infected.
WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the time the disease was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to any place (e.g. China), species or group of people, with worldwide restrictions in place to avoid bias.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "virus COVID-19" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in its public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are often referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO designated 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as temporary names for viruses and diseases following the 2015 recommendation to avoid the use of vaccines for diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
With limited capacity to produce quality products, some manufacturers produce medical devices such as nasal swabs and respirators.
In one example, when a hospital in Italy needed a ventilator, the manufacturer was late to deliver it, and a local factory invented and produced 100 of the required valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, a series of false, misleading, and misleading reports about the origin, severity, immunity, and treatment of the virus and other information about the disease began to circulate online in a matter of seconds.
Humans seem to be able to infect animals with this disease.
Studies have failed to find any information on the germ-producing activity in pigs, bats, and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine for the disease.
Global trials for a vaccine and a treatment for COVID-19 are being conducted by various government agencies, research organizations, and laboratories.
In March, WHO launched a "TEST-BASED REPROB" initiative to focus on the currently available vaccine that is most effective.
There is no cure, but various agencies are on a mission to try to find one that will work.
Preliminary studies on SARS-CoV are used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter the human cell.
Three types of vaccines are being researched.
First, researchers aim to develop a new antibody.
The use of such a virus, whether live or dead, is aimed at creating a reactive immune system in the human body to new infections as well as COVID-19.
Another approach, called subunit vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that makes the immune system resist the virus when it invades the body.
For SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that allows the virus to interfere with the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third option is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new approach to vaccine development).
Vaccine trials from these programs will require safety testing and clinical trials.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial began with four human volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Immunity enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 clinical trials underway.
Seven trials were conducted on already approved malaria drugs, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
An antimicrobial agent used to treat other infections is the largest part of China's research, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir scheduled to be conducted across several countries by the end of April.
A large clinical trial to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 and potential therapeutic agents was conducted in April 2020.Many existing antiviral drugs are under study for the treatment of COVID-19, including, remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was unconfirmed information that remdesivir may be therapeutic.
There has been a decrease in the incidence of patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria, was approved in China in February 2020, with preliminary findings.
Rather, there is a call for a multi-disciplinary review of the findings.
Health officials in Korea and China have endorsed the use of chloroquine.
However, while the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which advocates taking at least one dose a day, warns that overdosing is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency ruling banning the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the advice of physicians treating COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition of the Chinese version also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19.
The findings suggest that higher doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been studied in more than one species after a weakness in the inhibition of SARS- CoV-2 was identified.The findings suggest that initial spike protein priming of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is highly effective in injecting SARS-CoV-2 by binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have several limitations that have prevented clinicians from approving the use of these treatments without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and the efficacy is unknown for COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a serious disorder when COVID-19 is suppressed.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Toclizumab was listed as a potential drug by the China National Health Commission after a limited number of studies.
It is in phase 2 of a national-level clinical trial in Italy after showing symptoms in a patient.
It is now being combined with a serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms, and is intended to induce these reactions, which are thought to be fatal in some patients.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on previous studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another agent, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no conclusive evidence that you can cure CRS.
The transfer of surgically prepared and recombined immunosuppressants from COVID-19 survivors to the general population was considered a necessary preventive measure if the person was not vaccinated.
This method was tested for SARS but the results were inconclusive.
Antivirus therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses antibiotics specifically targeted against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other approaches to treat the immune system, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Convalescent serum, which contains blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies against the disease-causing bacteria, can be added to enhance the effectiveness of the vaccine.
Coronavirus infections, a group of symptoms that are similar
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, later tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently died after reporting the spread of the virus.
