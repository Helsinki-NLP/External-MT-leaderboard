So far, no drugs have been clearly demonstrated to treat an existing infection, although an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola deaths.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed great promise in this area, but official studies show that it has less contribution than needed to prevent deaths.
ZMapp serves as a control in the PALM study, which means that the scientists use it as a baseline and compare the other three treatments to it.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's now widely accepted, but it also gives details that the fossil record doesn't generally provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have found that the animal's feathers on top were brownish-brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed handle called the rhinus, but do have other feather characteristics - branches and hooks - the researchers conclude that the rhinus is probably a later evolutionary development, compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or parade.
The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult, not the down of a young individual.
Yesterday morning a car bomb exploded at the police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that it affects ordinary matter.
This theory claims that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is arranged around a halo-shaped galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

In the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, Dr. Tony Moll discovered highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
He said in an interview that the new variant is "very troubling" and is "worried" by the very high death rate.
Some patients may have picked up the virus from the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Within a year, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the rate of XDR-TB in the entire TB population still appears to be low; 6,000 out of 330,000 people infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared imaging shows that the temperature fluctuations between night and day suggest that these are probably caves.
They're colder than the neighboring surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal state is not as stable as that of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glenn Cushing of the USGS's Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally, voting in France is low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a booth, indicate the candidate they have chosen on a pre-printed sheet of paper and place it in an envelope.
Once the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, he or she places an envelope in the voting booth and signs the voter roll.
The French electoral law is quite strict about the procedures.
Since 1988, polling stations have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are released except those of duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts view the publication of photographs as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be moving along a dangerous line if they spread photos and so on of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for prosecuting the case, told reporters that no further comment would be made until charges were brought.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other themes are supposed to be the future state of Jerusalem, holy to both sides, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
After signing the agreement, Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agreed to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and its efficacy assessed.
The Australian Sport Shooting Association hunting programme has recruited qualified volunteers in partnership with NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Conservation and Heritage at the National Park Service's National Wildlife Service NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shot received detailed safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in to the nine-member new interim election board yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth temporary board in four years.
Last month, a committee to the president recommended the resignation of the former election commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the commission.
Violent protests have sometimes been triggered by the failure of elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 iPod devices malfunctioning, and an overheating incident has been reported, causing a total of six fires and slight burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it was aware of 27 incidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had been notified of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in the Apple report "a real regret".
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 07:19 am local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reports no damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held tourists hostage in Hong Kong after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate preterm birth in her spare time.
His research shows that if you administer a hormone, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators found two flight recorders called "black boxes" on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
There was a tribute to Luna and fellow fighters.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremism, my first manager, Luna went away on the night of the two moons, quite unique, like her.
"The moon is as strange as I am...maybe even stranger...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place", says Dustin Goldus Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to the idea of Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the end, 29% of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% say Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three Commonwealth Games relay events, but his fitness has been called into question by his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to manage the pain because it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest known prime number ever.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the Earth formed after comets collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There's been speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow flight controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and to determine the precise location of aircraft.
There is no additional transport and no ground trains will stop at Wembley and there is no on-site car park and parking facilities.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A new species of bird has appeared on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, reports a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium-sized earthfinch (Geospiza fortis) and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, it can be rolled into any shape.
It can be pulled out as a thin wire that can be spun and twisted, then forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and bonded to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn paintings in books known as illuminated manuscripts.
So if you use red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is, cabbage juice changes color.
The amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then form them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, and you'll feel a little weird, and it'll form a sort of envelope.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected by a complex sewage system.
In the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, the remains of sewage systems have been found in houses.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women in mixed company would gather together.
You use satellite when you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away.
The satellite in space receives the call and almost instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing we have because of the bicycle is a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, there are very small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat takes, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called pride.
The larvae consist of one to three adult males with blood relations, along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides act much like pack wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and just as lethal to their prey.
Like a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make huge jumps, and pull with the strength of five healthy men.
The tiger is in the same group as the lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that roar.
The roar of the tiger is not exactly like that of a lion, but rather it is like uttering roaring, shouting words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that survivors follow and find prey by their sense of smell, by guessing where they were on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very quietly, and they hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that its return is difficult), it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
After all, in thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and take in carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plant food, without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the supreme predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were dotted with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the top of his mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that would cross his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue, his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that went into the water; it couldn't even match a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had some rather strange or unusual delicacies, including boars, peacocks, snails and a species of rodent called the sleeping man
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate, sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together, lying on the side while eating.
It is not possible that ancient Roman cuisine included foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a prime temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of such importance.
Most of the Jewish family life takes place in the open.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just shelves overlooking the street.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
But despite his discovery, by this time, the Inuit tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs and the history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.
You might think that the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you've seen the movie "National Treasure".
But that's not true, it's not a treasure map, although there's something written on the back of the document.
The words Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776 are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at first, after it was created, the large parchment (293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was wrapped in a scroll for preservation.
Most likely, the notation was just added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the ensuing battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not.
It's run by the Vichy French, which is French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
The Allies entered southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and French forces had liberated southern France and moved into Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large and substantial group of people, working and living together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civic, related to the Latin civis, or citizen, and civitas, which is a city or city-state, and that kind of determines the size of society.
Culture in the context of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and natural diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence of their existence and therefore fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no taxing power, and with no national judicial or executive authority, it relied on government agencies, which often refused to cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
Nor does it have the authority to reject tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Clauses required the unanimous consent of all states to be amended, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives often absented.
Along with the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, as a geographical term, it is often called an archipelago.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, changing local grain production customs and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the boundaries of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how they came to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
The most common still format in the world, for example, is 35 mm. This was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format is inherited from the touch-sensitive image formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing twelve to get the lowest whole number denominator) is therefore 3:2.
Very common formats are equal to or very close to this ratio (e.g. a group of APS formats).
The much-abused and often-ridiculated rule of thirds is simply a rule that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most appropriate location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the photograph into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become rich and powerful, came under criticism.
The Christian religion has bound European nations together for over a thousand years, despite linguistic differences and different customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A basic Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds exist for that very reason.
The centralization of church power in Rome continued for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been observed.
Britain began a naval blockade of Germany soon after the outbreak of hostilities.
Although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective in disrupting vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain mines international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
The nations wanted to avoid a war situation again in the future after seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I.
To accept a job at the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; for each stage of history or for each ruling family, there was a separate dynasty.
Between each of the two dynasties, there was also a period of instability in the divided provinces.
During these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, and fighting to take the top spot in the grand palace of Xi'an, thousands of people died.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, classes were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of the military unit being based on class, it's now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside this worldly life, and to meditate, he often visited the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located atop a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the late Pharaoh.
In Egypt's Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, there are several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples are in honor of his women and family members.
The upward sign looks like a V, and the downward sign looks like a tailboard or bottomless square.
Up means you have to start at the top and press the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull it out.
An upward bow usually makes a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more confident.
Feel free to put your own signs, but remember that the printed bow strokes are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 -year-old Marie Th√©r√®se and 4 -year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women in the marketplace.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles to the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the military costs of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The U.S. colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover much of the cost and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The surplus profits made from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, major gains of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events occurred is usually called the Late Middle Ages - the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The actual Middle Ages is preceded by the Early and followed by the Late, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice - from the technological rush or technological imperative to the strict sense that human fate is governed by logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are shared among most interpretations of technological determinism: either the development of technologies itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, or technology itself influences inherent rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network would not be economically viable for a handful of cars alone, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars has also led to a higher frequency of road accidents, necessitating the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a large element of cultural determinism, which was pioneered by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures emerged that were related to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its glory as an epicenter of luxury dates from about 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts of spices and silk, which were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was very much influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles can lag 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button their clothes, one of the greatest developments of the time.
Livelihood agriculture is agriculture which is carried out to produce enough food for the sole needs of the farmer and his family.
Market farming is a simple, often organic system, often using preserved seeds from the same ecological area combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel ignored by social standards, and they allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The signs that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through the characteristic and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used means of illustrating the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, ill-treatment or deliberate violence, were not socialized by adults during the period of their children's growth.
Some untamed children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
The wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by animals, the feral child displays behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular caretaker animal, as well as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a training method but rather an aid that provides support to persons going through a new training, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The skeletons can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of skeleton, like the little guy with the pads in Microsoft Office.
The software has built-in virtual skeletons that are designed to ask questions, remind and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to handle on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing and educational, but it happens.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving people to care for, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care is supposed to provide everything necessary that was missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use of the satisfaction approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' have been cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and long-term relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Imay and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
Using video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
It is claimed, more specifically, that a person can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his book The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks points out that despite the fact that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able to perceive the sincere attitude.
He even suggests that similar abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Studies in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination blend the variations back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but they are hard for us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should come as no surprise if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual time to fall asleep and falling asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without completely waking you.
If you find yourself turning off your watch in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and our own tension and negativity are the only thing standing in the way of that goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is continued by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana path of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle, which is Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations and mantras.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and enlightenment of the mind is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years, and real combat was fought by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Cuba, to Afghanistan, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already defeated and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian beachhead and reorganize.
These plans, however, were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way of transporting huge numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and goods while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy is trying to stop this traffic, mostly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have invaded Britain, like the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goats, usually children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd.
Railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the more uneven roads of the time.
Travers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient with an iron band on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (or erect man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecines dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce some of the negative impacts in the future.
In many cases, it's just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being passed by Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the manuscript was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as Dunlap broadsides".
The document was first read publicly by John Nix in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops on July 9th in New York, a copy arriving in London on August 10th.
The 25 one-sided copies of Dunlap's large sheet of paper that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Now, many paleontologists believe that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today, and we call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for birds that still look like dinosaurs, there are many things.
They have claws and scales, they walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex and lay eggs.
Almost all computers in use today operate on the basis of manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't always show up immediately, but symptoms like vomiting are too common to diagnose right away.
The presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals may be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term bug is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from a recent acquaintance with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both flying and bed bugs are colorless, living in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parent's parental rights are terminated, after which the other couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the method that guides most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, although to rule out some of the possible hypotheses, experiments are used, asking questions and using guides also accompany research.
Naturalists and philosophers have been working more with classical texts, and especially with the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself torn from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run the cycle of free movement even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they either tagged the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a variety of effects.
Only mutations in cells in the germline can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is attractive for people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
Activities that can be done here include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples.
Every morning, people travel from small rural towns to work by car, and they pass by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is to some extent connected to and maintains a transport system through private cars.
That this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years is now being shown by science.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
Rarely in the developed world have there been so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus traffic flows have some logical sequence and can be represented approximately mathematically.
For a better view of the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help in the planning, design and ultimately operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid their enemies more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back on their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and sunflowers are the only insects that can't fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many hold the opposite view - that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in places.
The Amazon provides as much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 kilometers long, and thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the stone pyramid boom continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed in size and technical superiority.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the world's least populous and smallest independent state.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All the subjects of the Vatican are Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, so remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Metals are elements like calcium and potassium, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, and the universe is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So when it first came out, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was reduced to a lower status and use.
People today text on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The plutonium-nuclear bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill, and then the fission of the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to decay with little or no thrust.
The lunar surface is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There could be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness focus on finding what makes people respond or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized by the time they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory of motivation are two popular theories of content.
Generally speaking, once managers start managing their former colleagues, two behaviors are likely to emerge: on the one hand, those who try to stay "I'm one of our boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility and demanding responsibility from people.
You become, at the other end of the spectrum, an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often leads to a rift between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as normal teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not even understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a training organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be shown.
As a result, the organisation's workflow to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process in service of the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organisational training and knowledge sharing.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher performance.
The physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognition is provided by the neurobiological data, which narrows the scope of the study and makes it much more precise.
The link between pathology and brain behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is of great importance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science dealing with machine learning, behavior and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, being able to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Problems like this have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real life problems.
The artificial intelligence system, which is embedded in several home computer and video game software applications, is already commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military.
Excursions are a big part of schooling, and very often the teacher would like to take his students to places that can't be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual excursions, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip is also a great way to practice re-reading and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year that page is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a sketch.
While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes that fact.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer, to avoid criticism, has started to work on improving his writing.
The need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to be interesting and intelligent (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, students can be enabled to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet material in the context of other people's writings, students can define their own positions, and also outline their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming and bilingual capital of Canada, home to a number of art galleries and museums where you can see Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and the surrounding lands.
All of these things make Ontario a model of what foreigners think of as typical Canadian.
The large areas to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabitable deserts.
A population comparison that surprised many: the number of African Americans in the United States is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and is a continent in its own right, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope, the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that any woman travelling should declare that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to situations that they consider harassment, where they are often followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your positions (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Bayda, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established their trading bases there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagini, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of drunks, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Niragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets and especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Niragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle-taxi) to get around Goma.The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Timbuktu, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although it has become a tourist attraction because of its reputation and has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS show "The Special Wonders of the African World".
The city is markedly different from other cities in the country because it has an Arab rather than African look.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and the Crocodile River is its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 divided into 14 separate ecozones, each with a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Usually all South African national parks charge a daily fee for entrance and conservation of the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider worth visiting.
The series of buildings that shape Hong Kong's skyline resemble a brilliant column-shaped diagram that stands out from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely located on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the British colonizers took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) off the coast of Bangladesh and India.
This part of the forest, which is located on Indian territory, is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps  they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 square kilometres, almost a third of which is covered by water and swampland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that the area now has 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave throughout the day from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (beyond the river), although most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumtang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as long-distance buses are often full.
Most of the neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
The share taxis are a quick and convenient means of traveling short distances, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters (275 feet), 378 meters (1,250 feet) long, with two sails each 11 feet (3.5 m) wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous tribe inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering fruit and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and individual polo players in the world.
The biggest annual tournament is held in December at the polo ground in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
Check out Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo for news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) with a value equal to one British pound (GBP).
The only place to exchange money is at a bank in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and US dollars are also often accepted within Stanley credit cards.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted in the outermost islands, but British and US currency may be used; talk to the hosts in advance to find out which payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there, while in the Northern Hemisphere it's winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures are normally above +30 ¬∞C.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals still remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, from bears and wolves, stay at least 100 yards per meter, and from all other wildlife, 25 yards per meter!
No matter how obedient they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so don't go into their personal space.
In addition, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1850s.
The port was the scene of a scandalous naval encounter in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town ended with the assassination of the supreme leader Toupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Oakland is crossed by two harbors, there are many beaches, the most popular in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are protected sandy beaches for bathing and most have shade under the hotuka trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are off the coast of Whitemath Harbor, on the outskirts of the expensive Mission Bay and St. Heliers areas of central Oakland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a heavy beer, but it's nice and refreshing. Manta is the name of the other local beer.
There are plenty of French wines to sample, but New Zealand and Australian might do better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians: the short black is espresso, the cappuccino is whipped up with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian-standard, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many of the reef hikes are year-round, and reef accidents caused by any of these causes are rare.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
The cube jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the city of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you can also find other ways of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast included, transport to/from the airport or even combined air and hotel packages.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any amendments or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on the festival grounds and most participants consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you'll have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be festival scenes that will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals offer special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the hut, as for those most affected, crossing the ice causes quite a terrible noise.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Usually, casinos go to great lengths to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible.
To keep guests entertained and entertained, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low and you can't drive as well as on clean asphalt.
During thunderstorms, you can get enough snow to get stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or thunderstorms, as well as by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, freezing and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous year-round.
Safari is perhaps the most popular tourist attraction in Africa and is a final destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to a land trip to explore the amazing African wildlife, specifically the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars and get a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "desert walk", "tourist safari" or "walking") is a walk that lasts several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics since hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the season was announced, you may be in a difficult position.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a cast iron and an ironing board that can be used even if there are no ironing boards in the room.
If there is no cast iron or you do not want to wear socks that are flat, you can try using a dryer if one is available.
Do not allow the fabric to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or in extreme cases, burning).
Water can be purified in a variety of ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiency and if you're concerned, you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their native places.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals in themselves, which can injure or kill people by force, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers travelling to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often passing through isolated outlying areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous or following sections, where they are usually 35  40 mph (56  64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
Interestingly, though, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are exceptionally good, and Bavarian pastries are quite lavish and varied, similar to those made in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples being used year-round, and cherries and plums being enjoyed in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, nuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, though rich, pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfankuchen or krapffen.
Curry is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be either dry or wet.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, curry is often made with yogurt; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is the most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
But when used without further definition, the term usually refers to dishes originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Today, widespread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes many simple spiced dishes, and the predominant flavors preferred by Javanese are hot peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The saddle-strings are suspended on either side of the saddle supports for the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his leg gets caught in the stirrup, he will be pulled if the horse escapes.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a stream and a smooth, tight sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow the skin of the stallion to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley, Chile's top climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its abundance of large granite walls and canaries.
The beads include breathtaking views from the tops, and climbers from all over the world are constantly building new routes through the walls' infinite potential.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending over snow-covered terrain with a ski or snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, better known as 'ski boomers', planning entire ski holidays in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened Australia's first sports ski club.
Ski tourism: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski tourism.
They are similar but do not usually include alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Look at a ski run as similar to a tourist run.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking  but very rarely will you reach the speed of ski running without a heavy backpack on maintained slopes.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean multiple visitor applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
While you are in the territory of this zone, you can generally cross the borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, if you hold a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each Schengen Member State, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is an antique, but some tax agencies define antiques as being over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be smaller in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be considered antiques, even though they are not as old as ancient mass-produced goods.
