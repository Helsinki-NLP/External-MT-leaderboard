A Republican strategy to counter Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have identified only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in the last ten years.
One thing is certain: these new arrangements will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the US.
In this spirit, a majority of US governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 that made the process of registering or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
The laws also reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on election day and deprive citizens with criminal records of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities quickly extended this practice to other states.
In the last two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo IDs issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
Often, however, it costs more than $100 to obtain the required identification.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more than that.
Students, voters considered to be more likely to vote for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their institution-issued photo IDs.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more Republican to use the cards issued by those clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
Now, it turns out that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register some 10 million citizens.
Measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the rate of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators passed laws in five other states to reduce the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early voters were African-American, while African-Americans made up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same thing happened with Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, whites, who made up 76% of voters, made up only 46% of early voters.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring photo IDs.
Nevertheless, the new rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new arrangements will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Testing for prostate cancer - pass or fail?
The APS test may sometimes give false negative or false positive results, resulting in unnecessary medical intervention.
This makes men who are already reluctant to take the test even more reluctant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it's difficult to interpret this data and make firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who had been tested and those who had not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you have a 30 to 40 percent greater chance of metastasis if you're not screened.
So I recommend testing at age 50, or at age 40 if you have a direct relative who has had prostate cancer before.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you've been diagnosed with cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the risk of his cancer, by offering him the options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not life-threatening, and instead, in those cases, opting for active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and life-threatening.
We're going to suggest that they be actively monitored, and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, there is a strict definition of what criteria should be used to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend you take the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite the advances in research, good habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It's estimated that if everyone ate right and got enough exercise, we could prevent 30 percent of all cancers.
"If no one smoked anymore, the rate would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Society continues to make tobacco control a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is a huge health risk.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", laments spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging fact: Ten years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Obesity and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer", it adds.
The food
The WHO also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
So are the meat shops, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer", they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are conflicting, according to the SCC.
While one woman noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not well established.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Studying for cancer doesn't mean you have cancer".
The Higgs boson has been de-orbited.
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
This is because we believe that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more.
And then, this is the last particle that is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But physicists are not yet completely sure that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a genuinely new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data released this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but we still lack the data to be absolutely sure.
Let's just say that it's the Higgs, because the chances of getting it wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is a law in this underworld that cannot be broken. Two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule - and don't try too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And the other is about bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- at least not that principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure website at Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson is in some way related.
These bosons, it should be pointed out here, are not all as exotic as you might think.
In fact, if you are able to read this column, it is because of a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or "light particle", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at that particular point, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disorder" comes an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except that it's another field, the Higgs field, that has to be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, which only a very large rock could wrinkle the surface.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-kilometer ring! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on its own on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, you know) don't.
Now, what can all this research "bring", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the MS.
Many are eager to see it, because the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" and close some holes in the Model.
It has, it must be said, still huge flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (oops!).
But we haven't found such discrepancies at CERN until now.
The effects
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr and Mrs All-World is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
Look, back in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser technology at Bell Labs had no idea what a revolution their work was going to spark.
They were seeing some scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we've been told by the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - that at first the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gadget".
Can you imagine?
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, in 1969, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work on optics.
This sensor, although not at all what he originally intended, is now used as the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and it won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
That doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Commission to die with dignity, Quebec has recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
But much remains to be done in this vital area.
The Duty tried to look more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
He had been suffering from prostate cancer for two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I made seven", he said, half fig half grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the night before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that", he says.
The disease is working: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone, and even eating alone.
He sits down to a delicious lunch, and he accepts help to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who rush around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for the disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man urinates standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the childhood stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept regression, he says.
Because, according to many people working in palliative care, great moments are happening at the very heart of this regression.
The patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home are all cancer patients.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called 'curative' care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is dying "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life", she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for the last visit of her son from Italy in the next few days.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
It's palliative care, which is what you give when there's nothing else to do.
To make the death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the house's doctors.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
On the dying, we'll accept brandy or Pepsi mouthwash, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer, and he died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help the family as well as the patients", says Nathalie Savard, a director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, days follow but are not alike.
With a 93-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the yard, well-dressed in his pillows as a toast is made in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months now, there have been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age", says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the end of his life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois House and the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great shortage in Quebec's health care system that has many palliative care doctors fearing the passing of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by top palliative care officials including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not good enough to ensure that everyone will have access to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
She says that recently I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without any help.
I'm afraid some patients only ask to die because they don't get the right care.
And at the same time, many oncologists are working hard on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard's chances of survival were already slim when she gave up a grueling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she said she was sorry I stopped fighting, she said.
She told me I was finished!
Not the Almighty
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank their caregivers for not granting their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But palliative care is not the absolute all-powerful way to treat pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are unwilling to accept pain-relieving treatments in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is the practice of putting the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend anymore that we don't hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the option of having this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell us day after day what they know about a formidable "system" that includes the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
This "industry" has cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system has been crumbling since we took the big shot", says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec legislator and former Montreal police chief.
He was the one who caused the scandal in 2011, through a thorough investigation into mismanagement of road works contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only backed off.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, covert party financing and government corruption.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Department of Transport alone has reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts", he points out, some of them restraining their instincts to get a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrating the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police of the "Hammer Squad" who, since 2009, have led the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly taking bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The charges also include Montreal road engineers and Italian-born contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the 'system' of obtaining public contracts.
He himself spent years paying 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who poured the money into Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has been sowing wildfire in the 2000s, giving over C$88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, mainly the then-ruling Liberals.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts he inflated the cost of
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was running wild.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained to the commission: "In ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and bribes totalling $736,000 in exchange for contracts for sewage treatment, which he inflated".
Other road officials admitted to getting fat by inflating bills by 30 to 40 percent with false extras.
Then a party organizer for the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a side budget that fed his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of the real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be set up, she says she is "pulling on a thread to understand how the system, infiltrated by ants, works to stop the gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but we'd need a Montreal-based investigative unit and a watch to keep the shady practices from returning.
How we clean up.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected officials who know the plot", when they are not immersed in the ruse!
Estimating that 70% of the money used in Quebec's election campaigns is dirty money, he ironically says: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100 but this will not change the situation, he says: "Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics".
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Some great players have come.
Every day, I'm making progress with them.
The technical staff also helped me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in a match, it's easier than that.
Things go very fast in football.
But I'm not getting hot.
From my first days at the pre-training centre of the INF Clairefontaine to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by stages.
So you're taking advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to fight and give the maximum.
And Carlo Ancelotti is a big part of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same role as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
- Of course you do.
Ancelotti is respected by all the technicians.
Today, he is second to none in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience and won a lot of titles with fancy clubs.
He's been around some great players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming conversation with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of the first game of the season at PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the last eight with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We're gonna try and get as far away as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we'll have a say in the face of some very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, so we can receive in the 8th round of the final.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget.
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and to register for the duration.
Today, that is not the case.
The PSG is financially able to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to take the championship.
Last season, we didn't get very far.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's only natural that we're expected to be a lot, given what we've invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's sure to be a little frustrating.
You wonder what else people want.
We're never gonna be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put together a game plan.
A team builds over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can answer in person.
Look at Manchester City, who have failed to qualify for the last two seasons, they've also spent enormous amounts!
We thought you'd be 15 points ahead of the truce.
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
That shows how exciting Ligue 1 is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better if we say there's a "Zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is very good and he scores a lot of goals.
He came for that and he's proving he's the star of League One.
He's proven everywhere he's been that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
It makes others want to play higher.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also helps everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing.
I saw things there and I came out stronger.
Today I can make good selection matches.
I've been hoping for this since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps ' first few months at the helm of the Blues ?
He's got the results for himself.
We're in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires winning.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the draw (1-1) in Spain on 16 October a founding match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
The opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Some 200 000 transactions have already been recorded on 15 000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a high of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Not very impressive, compared to the world's trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", which are used to advance in a video game that is earned by playing or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both ledger keepers, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins are in the public ledger, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to the computers, and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that extra line.
This is a file hashing phase, which is the transformation of a large file into a shorter, unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole thing.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it's the right number.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, in order to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other being orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided in two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, leaving a margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also increased with each increase in computing power.
Life on the network has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The flaw used is not related to the protocol itself", assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also points to the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, "giant soldiers" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who also wrote a textbook on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a network for transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The user also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is give an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement away from hierarchical systems towards more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB also plans in its report to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting everything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by treating them as terrorists.
And us, with our 88 soldiers dead, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who are refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign troops, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills of almond trees planted with French funds, was carried out in an orderly manner.
The convoys of trucks and tanks reached Kabul without attack, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban surge on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country in flames and blood from the fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They've turned into businessmen, seizing government land and selling it back into construction land to refugees coming in from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American subcontracting contracts.
They were not thinking; most of them had not even fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from the American bounty. Capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They've been around the modern world in their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they've enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of both boys and girls.
We must provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including armed opponents, is addicted to cell phones; television, with its Turkish soap operas that present the modern world, is everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with the re-establishment of provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralisation, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister which had existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restored, no dam is in good condition, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
There was a rumor that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take it.
Without the energy to process iron or copper ore on the ground, or the means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost already left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
It will also take some time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, to return to normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' high schools, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a "civil-military actions" department of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, has carried out, and is being carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These local labour-intensive works helped contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would help to improve the very difficult local living conditions in these valleys, which are often over 2000 metres above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order to free them from the insurrection of foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, they would have to be given a small, well-controlled civilian aid which directly affects them.
A Constitution in forceps in Egypt
It's another poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, it has decided to play it safe.
He took everyone by surprise when he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this House two more months to finish its work.
For almost two years, Egypt has relied on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which has weakened institutional stability and led to legal problems.
This new initiative has only increased the division in the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample the law".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
A referendum should be held within the next fortnight.
A very short period of time that forced the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems confident that Egyptians will vote in favour, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
This is especially true since the use of a hasty vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I retain full powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the declaration of the constitution, they had slammed the door, feeling that they had not been able to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 alternate members were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, the majority of the articles were voted unanimously.
Some commentators have even made fun of the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around the time of the prayer, with some members of the committee feeling that the clock of the constituency was mis-set.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
The subject of all attention, Article 2 is ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the principal source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals reply, seeing it as a mere communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular as regards the verification of the compliance of the laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people who are called upon to make their own decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It is the beginning of a theocracy".
The Liberals are also concerned that the next rector of this university will be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulama but academics, some of whom are trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity about Article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
References to fiqh are made, especially to Islamic jurisprudence.
And the question may be raised in the future as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it".
The text adopted yesterday is not only religious in nature but also widely criticized because of the extensive powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of dispute was the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will the military courts be allowed to try civilians, as human rights groups have called for.
The latter also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Moreover, no news articles are more about women's protection, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point, she said, was the Article 36 ban on torture.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are looking forward to holy sites, the World Centre and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comforts, and wildlife.
Argoumenty i Fakty has picked five main reasons for you to go to Israel.
Go worship at the holy places
Go to the Jordan River where Jesus was baptizing.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptism depths" will be touched by divine grace.
And Galilee is the land of Jesus' miracles - where he turned water into wine, where he walked on water, where he calmed the wind, or where he miraculously caught fish.
It was there that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But where you'll find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
The faithful walk along the Rue de la Suffrance or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins near the Fortress of Antonia (the Praetorian Palace), where the trial was held, and then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, and then to that of the Anointing Stone and the tomb.
Here is the center of the Christian world, the symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is built on the spot where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site of the Jews: the Wailing Wall, which is the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave short words with prayers that are then answered.
Flying high
Visit the ruins of the fortress of Massada, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can go there on their own.
For others, a cable car takes them to this historic peak.
In the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
Old beliefs say that pagan gods once dwelt on the mountain's summit.
Visit some unique museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
Here are five of the most interesting ones that are worth a visit.
First, the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the ancient Qumran Manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves in the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The exhibition is mainly devoted to the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths made of mouldings of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guidebooks or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial in Tel Aviv, which is a re-enactment of the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk in and you're in total darkness.
The stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaports lie along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius while the air temperature can reach 23 degrees Celsius.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world - it is the lowest point on Earth, at 417 meters below sea level.
The blue-colored water is salty and easily trapped by swimmers, even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes around it are surreal.
People come to the temple to perform saltwater, lime, and mud treatments and to treat various ailments, such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and simply to relax.
Unlock the secrets of the ancient world
They are guarded by the ancient city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is traversed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially enjoy walking along the narrow lanes named after the zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theater, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Caesarea was the capital of the Roman Empire of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you are going to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to use dollars rather than euros, since they are easily exchanged for shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly by bus, but Jerusalem has a fast tram system, and Haifa has the only six-station metro line in the country, which connects the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost like an underground funicular.
The fare for all types of public transport is 6 shekels and you can make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to observe the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transportation are closed.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
There are a variety of dishes made from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, as well as hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, ground chickpeas, falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many well-fed cats that walk around looking arrogant.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats like to be in the middle of nowhere and they don't mind being treated.
The price of a car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
The average entrance to the museum is 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
Most of them were travelers and holidaymakers from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Who has a language, goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are debating what the law on the compulsory language test will bring, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are from Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families back home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force that requires every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
At the moment, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, in time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, as well as Russian history and the foundations of law, will need to be validated.
You will need to validate your knowledge of Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian is an official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained teaching certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples' Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders had already asked the question in the press many times: What will it do?
What will the requirement to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, the immigration officials say, it will reduce the number of people suffering "slavery at work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems are for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the language, says Sebelev, the prospective migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "trip" to a crowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellow workers will languish for months without food and paper and will have to work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've been getting a lot of complaints from our immigrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken, and they do not receive the expected salary", confirms the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many Central Asian citizens who wish to come to Russia to earn money admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to visit but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, or Tajiks can afford to attend even a decent primary school.
Their families cannot even feed their children, let alone dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, they go out to earn money at the first opportunity.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished".
Human Rights activists note, however, one important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be for migrants with legal status only.
Without a status, there will be no examination or official work afterwards.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or no entry"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money - between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know we have false documents, we have no record, hence the extortion cases.
"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes and tea", Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
"Hurry up, don't be lazy and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the language law, it was discovered that not only the immigrant registration papers were fake.
Several false language test certificates have already been confiscated by the Federal Migration Service.
The counterfeit paper comes from a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners were not disappointed. Each migrant who hoped to make the exam easier had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The government officials and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper pieces".
The authorities may give migrant workers who failed the first examination time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes toughening the law against civilian gun owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents, from the shooting at weddings to the murder by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead.
Police want to ban the carrying of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy to see the Russian authorities trying to solve the problem by "screwing the screw".
An open letter has appeared on the Internet in which the authors, representatives of various firing centers, demand that "this senseless hardening" be abandoned.
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime expert for the BBC, told Russia's state-run news agency.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a registered firearm in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of laws on civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: From the factory to the officer
The black market for weapons is provided through several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and at Headquarters.
Screenshot from a gun-control site
The first is the "military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians", Baranets explains.
The second type of black market weapon is the one that criminals steal from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal guns are being sold from military warehouses.
Many of these have been frequently blown up.
"There are verified reports that some fires were set deliberately to cover up the shortfall", explains the former soldier.
Baranets thinks the weapons manufacturers are responsible for something.
"We see private arms factories that are not competing on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow", says one expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply", adds the former soldier.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have estimated the approximate share of each source of illegal arms on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records, and public data from weapons-related websites.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the guns on the black market ended up there "because of employees whose work is related to guns", explains the report.
According to the researchers, 17 percent of guns are from military conflict sites, 14 percent are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5 percent are from "clandestine leaks".
A dealer and consultant at a gun-shop who asked to remain anonymous assured that the weapons found by these specialists in clandestine excavations had long been out of stock.
He said that most often, the sellers go to military warehouses to get the new goods.
The person purchases a unit through a sign, for example a TT pistol.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a grid.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers", he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they buy control from illegal arms dealers", the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone was supposed to take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, I got it on the spot
Victor Baranets as military observer
To get a gun, I have to know someone who has a contact, the salesman explains.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you also have to come and say for example "From this person, who asked me to tell you that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't.
New kids look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as an illegal gun buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he says, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album that said "everything you want".
"I thought I was in a fancy shop", recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, you can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the salesman into the woods and set up a target.
"They let me shoot, and when I'm convinced the weapon is working, we start negotiating", the expert explains.
A shop from his couch
Search engines show the sites and groups on Vkontakte where one can buy weapons "for different purposes".
You don't need any documents or anyone to meet.
"All you need is a certain amount of money", says an advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
And we sell to miners?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan".
"Buy TT. Moscow", wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has a vast network of fake websites and is scouting for people willing to buy combat weapons.
People rush for food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia.
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I've heard of this kind of scheme: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking over.
The buyer makes the payment at the ATM.
"He receives a photo and instructions about where the weapon is hidden", explains Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to Gun Association.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying on the site, you can end up unarmed and behind bars.

One Makarov for 100 bucks
The cost of an illegal gun, experts estimate, can range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Gun Association, a Makarov pistol can be bought for $100 to $300.
It'll take about a month and a half.
It was taken out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia overall decreased by 7% to 22.9 miles while the number of confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: Fast food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers end up working as cashiers at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has been mounted against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or quickly subside.
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the modest wage increases for basic workers at Walmart and fast food chains, protest organizers are pushing for the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a flood of sales that swept millions of people across America, sometimes triggering riots.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize picketing strikes with unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores, whose products are intended for consumers of the middle and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs to milk.
The average price of products is 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid employees at Walmart only shop at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, partly because of the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklift trucks or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded a pay rise, they complained that the price of the company's medical insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic wage at Walmart, which is $9.5 an hour, that's a lot of money they can't afford.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the company $3.2 billion.
That's 1.1% more than he spends now.
If Walmart were to shift all the wage increases onto the shoulders of consumers, every purchase in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They'll spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine states and have not caused any harm to the group.
Black Friday continued in stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day, and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second during that time.
His banks made a total of 100 million transactions for Black Friday.
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman assured in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that "fewer than five" Walmart employees had quit altogether and that the protest was just a "com operation among many" by the organizing union.
"Next client!" He said, "I'm going to the store".
The protests continued this week in New York and did not include Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, so they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's is advertising billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for the honest work you've done!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food companies increase their rates over time, but soon, on average, their basic employees in New York City earn $8.90 an hour.
Nobody in this town is less touchy than they are.
I can't imagine living in New York with that kind of money.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living at home with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live on that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, you find comments saying that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The United States law prohibits the administration from obstructing this and punishing union protestors by bullying or dismissal.
However, the government rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over the fast food business is still a difficult task, and for very real reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They Don't Agree
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near the McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for the honest work you've done!"
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said "we all need to support fast food workers so they get the fair pay and economic well-being every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times described the demonstration as the largest in the history of the fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all of them were fast food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is difficult to say at this time whether this spark of mass movement will cause small ones.
"At the moment, we can only fool the brain on average"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
At first, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft Labs in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists at this company, glasses are already ancient history.
They're tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment with pixels on flat screens and sometimes touch.
We want to look five to 10 years ahead and guess what radical changes will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without the Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is in store for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered physical interaction, a lot of things happen on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system receives more data), but the efficiency, for the moment, not so much.
We're trying to change that, and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to bring the computing world into our own, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
This, however, requires identifying not only the user but also the space around him.
So we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical way.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command ?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
This is not the panacea. The question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of our actions or intentions.
In fact, every kind of computer interaction is good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera on the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's currently large, but it's theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can to you?
You would do it with words and with gestures.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or can't do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and that's very important.
- If we're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you dislike about modern cameras?
Is it that they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we rely on in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to that last point, all the current technologies are pretty good, which adds work to the algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind in terms of the X and Y axes, but also the Z axes.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, has given touch sensors a steady processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
I would need a camera like this in my work, but it doesn't require touch, so I can get more frames per second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a regular visible field sensor.
It's not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of computation required.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how that could help define locations.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with a smartphone with your hands up is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be a "temporary" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to a smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that is what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the common mortal.
There is one problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
My hands can't feel a thing!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
One of the most interesting techniques at the moment is the use of the second hand as a picture medium.
It's a perfect record of pressure!
But there are also technologies which are really designed to give palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is and which gives you the sensation, at the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of your fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis that presents perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task below that will take a long time to solve: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of running mats (not like those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we are only moderately successful at deceiving the brain, and there are still many years of work to be done.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the project "The St. Petersburg Avant-garde" dedicated to the city dwellers who are at the forefront of culture and art.
This highly selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city's borders and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red, who can be seen at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, and even at fancy parties and opening ceremonies.
Kirill Miller's paintings still attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
He is one of the Petersburg storytellers, who are fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, and its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and cheer.
He recently took up a Barbary organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he was mature enough for this difficult role by his existence, philosophy and image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking around the city in red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of the image and society.
Even though in society, anything that isn't gray is a source of aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were going to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture where my work was.
I realized that this was my path.
So the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood.
I started to make friends with the new wave painters, with the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pushinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theater, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be in the center of culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must meet.
In 1995, I took a seat at Pushkinskaya-10 which, before the construction, housed a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: Les NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming up with the project "Van Gogh's ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in mouldy shirts, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer now in fashion.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was hosting a lot of shows before Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his training and basic education, he received it from us.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are the repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as regulars.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: it was the "People of Our City" award.
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that was when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new age with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a cultured person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong timeliness and sharpness.
I'm having an exhibition scheduled for the Russian Museum through the clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be a social person, but now it hurts and it's scary to be that way.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragedy falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, the clothes are important, the outer mechanism is important, but not the inside of the person.
Maybe we can't shake his hand, but we should spit on his chest.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
We recently saw you playing the organist of Barbary.
Who else but me can play it?
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquor.
A cultural disintegration is occurring.
Before, people were divided into herds, and the bohemians liked one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everybody.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we dumped who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and in the end it's less management, less money, everything rotted out.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was young, I used to paint paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones that are painted at the end of life.
Today, people often confuse ideas.
They say there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for that culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this concept: the cultural official.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand culture very well, but they understood that you have to keep the good experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're being sidelined, because we need higher-level experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave a path for them.
Today, the "reign of taste" is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say they don't take all contemporary art, that there are painters that must be found in other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our rocks, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who go to see exhibitions, concerts.
This diaper is very thin.
We need to make art as fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a deadly asteroid collision.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthlings aboard are leaving in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: How do we keep our species living in weightlessness or on a backup planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Institute for Astronomy (GAICh).
If conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
It's only habitable at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to get interested in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were being done on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit were in no way different from the terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects were put into orbit, tiny fly-eating, breeding dross.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an unweighted embryo develops.
You get a perfectly normal chick on the way out.
Then the problems start.
"The problem is that the chick needs to find a support, get on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
With no support, the chicks roamed in disorderly ways.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We gouged out their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it's just impossible to work with them there", explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, we have not discovered anything supernatural.
"We were still using biosatellites and this is the only experiment we have done, and we have to do this kind of research", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions directly in space are not yet possible.
It's not a small matter.
With the loss of their natural habitat, animals are no longer able to fulfill their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable of this, in principle.
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking, they can create a proper emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been going to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is the most precious thing that humanity has.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question", explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space industry expert.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having twice been in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it is dangerous even in orbit", concludes the Soviet hero and Russian hero, the pilot and cosmonaut Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet, mankind must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Centre: compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts are training for extra-vehicular sorties.
Water imitates weightlessness.
While water is a comfortable but alien environment for adults, it is a true element for infants.
The little amphibians seem to confirm that life on Earth originated in the ocean.
Since the baby develops in the lymphatic fluid of the mother's womb for about nine months, it is easier for it to get used to water.
This makes sense, since from birth to the first bath, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget", explains Marina Aksenova, a swimming instructor for infants.
In short, if for the newborn child weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of gravity.
When weightless, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
Okay, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will be able to get him out.
"And then?" asks Valery Poliakov, inviting us to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it doesn't feel the pull of the earth, the body doesn't form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult in a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experiment, which we would imagine in this case, imagining the birth of a child in an alien environment, will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely unadapted", predicts Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, in time, this will become a reality, as Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the home of their spaceman-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution for the Control of Public Finance) said: "The control of the pseudo-self-employed (in Czech 'Svarc system') has failed because of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but lagged behind in its enforcement.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution for Public Finance Control in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in our country", Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs would not bother entrepreneurs with controls; is that permissible or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demand compliance with the law", Kala said.
At the meeting of the Committee on Auditors in the Chamber of Deputies you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was the specific issue ?
This is a parallel control which we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way public procurement is managed and for specific national legislation and practice to follow.
We have collected all this and although this control procedure is not yet complete, we have found some very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation may be 'harder and of better quality', but according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to develop more and more detailed rules on a continuous basis, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you in practice and what are the results for you?
This is a common control which should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when it is not having a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest) in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the market thresholds may not achieve this objective.
It may be that the system is so overwhelmed with paperwork that those looking for flaws in it will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organising it?
As regards the institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is similarly organised, and also has a slightly differently constituted council, but these two institutions operate in a fundamentally similar manner.
The powers are also to some extent similar, with one nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has accounting courses of this type at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country is equivalent to state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Länder' accounting rates.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in certain areas Germany is often cited as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As regards national legislation, what has the amendment of the law on public procurement meant for you as an institution? Are its effects already being felt?
This amendment is relatively recent in coming into force and has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
We are doing ex post checks, so there is a delay.
Our observations concern only the preparation process for future checks at the moment - we have launched a new 'mismanagement risk detection' tool with which we have screened almost 14 000 public procurement contracts - where these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions for certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you see the passing of this law as an advantage or as an additional burden on the administration?
I think this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to comply with them.
Under the previous rules, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the procurement law constituted a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really worth making the law tougher this way?
No, not like that, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without impact on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDGs would not bother entrepreneurs with so-called Švarc system controls - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorised?
The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting and enforcing the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it", but he can't say that we're going to act like nothing happened.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the tendering process.
But it is also tragic that a tenderer is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and that is what I think we lack.
The roads are frozen in places, but most of them are still walkable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, the network remains largely viable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were clear this morning, but in places frozen and also snowed.
Temperatures have fallen and are now between -5°C and -10°C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
The snow has stopped in the region and there is only a thin layer of snow left in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metallic Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimeters of snow.
The data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service show that due to fog, visibility was reduced in some places.
The R6 motorway and the national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, caution is still required, for example on some bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
All regional roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also navigable.
Some of the tracks still contain traces of frozen snow and in some places are riddled with traffic.
Drivers should be especially vigilant in high-altitude areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Highways and Motorways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by glacial formation and that traffic-prone snow layers may be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in the high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be frost around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on county and third category roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow is present on the roads in the high-altitude areas.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry, mostly clear, with occasional cloudy skies.
It will be a weak wind and temperatures will generally range from -3°C to + 1°C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen area are now navigable, although in some places more vigilance and adaptation to the weather conditions is required.
It 's freezing this morning , temperatures ranging from - 3 to - 9 degrees .
After the last snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers may expect to cross foggy areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost easy to drive, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The pavement of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
The following conditions apply: (i) the following conditions apply:
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers travelling to the high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now have to rely on a thick, soft snow cover on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field that night, and according to the road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
"On the heights of the Šumperk district there are snow remnants.
Drivers heading towards Jeseník should expect to encounter a thick, soft snow cover at the "Červenohorské sedlo" pass", the head of the Šumperk district road maintenance service told ČTK today.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the site overnight, and according to them, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are easily walkable, but in the Šternberk district drivers should be careful in sections in forest areas where the road remains wet.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the North Bohemian Road Service has reported several difficult sections.
Police data show that in addition to some areas covered by snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads.
No traffic problems have been reported so far.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
Weathermen said that the conditions at night were ideal for its formation - rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and frost at night.
The main routes also report difficult conditions on the national road 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches that have curved under the weight of the snow until they reach the road.
"Together we want to collect positive energy", said Šimon Ornest.
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band, The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we think we're the only band that can collect a little bit of positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
And you're planning a very special project for December. Three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you give our readers a more detailed account of this project?
It's a charity event we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically at the end of the Mayan calendar on the Pacific island of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed it with our designer, Honza Augusta.
Aside from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world we're leaving to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including original shoes, T-shirts, bags, and end-of-the-world keys, by purchasing them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap band with other performers also recorded an anti-end of the world anthem entitled "End of the World Cancelled" (Czech: Konec světa zrušeno).
It's already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the end, well, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at some point in a live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the video, Xindl X also sings in it.
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech entertainment personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We try to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and enjoy it.
What good will the profits from these concerts do against the end of the world ?
To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on for six years, within the framework of the Jedlička Institute, together with the association Tap.
Teachers regularly visit the students at Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that are interesting and entertaining.
The students themselves cannot afford to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands and performers take the stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria did you use to choose them?
We have tried to develop a programme that is suitable for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be a showcase of the films Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May we will play for the first time in Prague, and we will surely be preparing a good programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic House in New York and personally, once we are in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members in electric chairs whose equipment has to travel in a trunk, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and tool boxes....
So far everything has gone pretty well, ČSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
You can compare your trips abroad with the differences between these countries in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards disabled people, and so on.
What have you been up to so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the East all is still in an initial phase.
Compared with Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to disabled people, and it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the city centre.
They don't yet consider it a given to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being formed to try to draw attention to the problems of the disabled.
What else do we have to do to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move around alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of disabled people are actively involved in social life, and in this respect, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access to facilities are one thing, but things will really start to change when we have famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers in our midst.
At the moment, these are just isolated cases of people who have strong will.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band at the moment, let's go back a few years, what made you start this band in 1998?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people who were willing to commit themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician myself (I play saxophone, among other things), with a colleague, we created a music business.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we kind of lost control of the situation. (Laughter)
Success has only come in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, making connections with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped.
We have realized that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's subsidies, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Was it your goal to reach that level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: anything new is accepted with caution and lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural...
But compassion is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned beings that we need to take pity on.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the means to do so, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it's not just a breakthrough for them, it's a breakthrough for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you're a demanding leader, as you're called by many people?
If we want to do good work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and demand a certain amount of discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds, and when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
One, one by name, Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to anyone who wants or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the predicted end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 9 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague at the Incheba Arena, in Brno at Fléda and in Ostrava at Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song "End of the World Cancelled" by The Tap Tap will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the European Space Agency's Ministers, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years has participated in a number of ESA projects.
Poland's journey into space, however, began much earlier.
Even before World War II, enthusiastic Poles were working on space flights, and they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw on December 6, 1933, in which he presented ideas from his groundbreaking book entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The late Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great proponent of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned proponent of astronomy, his contribution being rewarded in particular by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925 a dredge was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was intended to propel or brake the drain.
The only information known about this drain is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the archives that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937 plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects to use rocket technology were led by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the outbreak of war put an end to its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne (Polish Astronautical Society).
The first mention of a company was in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problème, which contained four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to the
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This 1,800-meter-long rocket was 80 centimeters long and weighed just under five kilograms.
An improved version, RM-1A, was subsequently built, and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were begun in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kilograms.
The next prototype should have been capable of performing concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM type rockets.
This two-stage rocket had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A had a space offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a 10 kg payload at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut in this programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Works Act.
This decision has been hotly debated in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at this problem from a broader perspective.
The economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in practice that the various economic entities and national economic systems are in perpetual conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and the free (unlimited) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour price (wages) generate a price pressure.
The term should be understood as meaning that a producer, by importing goods sold at low prices, tries to resist economic competition by 'making' the competitor's price higher, with the aim of taking a larger share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, buy at low prices or disappear, resulting in high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it creates, the social burden on the State necessarily increases.
The whole situation intensifies the absolute reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in the various economies in which the governments of the various countries are forced to enter into a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard for social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to economically compel its own population to accept the price dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is due to a system of economic constraints in the event of longterm unemployment and to the restriction of workers' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and a deepening gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food distribution points for years for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of such people is already in the millions.
As the German economy becomes more competitive, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement to ensure that they reach the minimum necessary.
Such a scandal has been reported, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly create a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live on meager wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that private capital will one day invest in their country.
The question is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This is also true for all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of saying that the state cannot invest capital in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strongly supports the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
The question then arises as to whether private capital does not influence and even direct politics and, by extension, the entire State, according to its own selfish interests.
The answer to that question is without a doubt yes.
The proof is that there is a lobby that is practically all-powerful and present in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the field of corruption, in the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions claim, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appian in his work entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in full decline and functions were assigned by violence.
Bribery, illicit favors, and stones and swords were also used to secure these positions.
The underbelly and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"... ... "Honest people did not seek any office, and as a result the state once remained 8 months without consuls".... ' It really began to be said that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appian had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, society today is based on the preference for personal gain, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, as in the past, an unprecedented decline of the elite, with no effort to carry out any fundamental reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human lives being lost, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of lowering the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is to implement sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen state capital investment in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital as a monopoly in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: a laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will", says Sting in the song titled Fragile, whose main refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be none", said Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take Israel's side, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is guilty and who is the victim in the wave of repeated killings; after all, the people of Israel today, including those in the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not live through the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer the reader a view from 'behind the curtain', one which is mainly benefitting from the tensions which have already been going on for more than 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others arise from my own understanding of who, or more precisely, the group of individuals, is the principal instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
In each age, we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone on the throne who directed their actions according to pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in an age when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that gives rise to certain powers could not have been achieved in one generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family stands out in particular, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course I did.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world's leading news agency (Reuters) in order to stop the linking of their name to serious criminal acts in which they were involved, which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major holdings in almost all the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 of these countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America as a central bank and began issuing his own money during the Civil War (government money, I understand) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK started issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he was trying to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33rd degree initiated Freemason, being the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population by between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create one universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order after the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent a recurrence of crises like those which they provoked in 1907).
After successfully starting World War I by assassinating Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic or military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the central European power.
For the ease of starting World War II, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany massive war reparations thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (then they just had to put a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing fingers at the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that was to play the role (which it did) of a fifth column to set fire to the powder and start a war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or whether all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as war reparations imposed on Germany were the cause of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel was the cause of a fire that could lead to World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first casualty of the fighting, this time along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but internationally (just look at how people are sharply divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another wrong in an endless cycle of violence and where the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world is at the root of it all?
We must distinguish between ordinary Israeli citizens and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers offer the people only their own candidates for elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) spread into a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all the world's oil passes (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and causes the destruction of the world economy.
How do we now see the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order?"
They think of the New World Order as a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
It also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on his hand or forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is where understanding comes in: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of this wild beast.
This number is for man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: when things go to hell, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student protesters stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, for it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, compounded later by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organised by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle was a major contributor to the defeat of Jimmy Carter by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, depicts an episode of this story that brought a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After a few complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran under a cloak: they left the country with Canadian passports as part of a film crew to do spot-shoots for a major science fiction film.
Combination of the genders
The plan by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend more credible, specialist magazines reported on the film project, press conferences were held, and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, as the film was based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is partly a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a betrayal - as, for example, in the Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres are in succession: documentary-style footage of Tehran (under-titled footage features iconic photographs of the time of the events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no major differences),
Some lighter Hollywood scenes, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with men in costumes discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculous actor, he became a respected director, and his acting no longer drew ridicule.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that set his early films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the word.
He does it very well, sometimes he adds some elements to reality and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway is quite hairy).
The weakness of Argo is its dissipative nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their roles as Hollywood co-workers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are far from the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it is shown with moderate interest, appreciating the direction and retro style of the 70s.
He's pulling the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a still, in a way, unfinished story to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the Secret Service as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch a competition for the most absurd regulations or ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering adopting a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of large European companies has been the reason for our decision", said the organiser of the survey, Patrik Nacher, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities mentioned is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have been at an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, less risk for insurance companies.
People can report any other idea of the EU workshop that is as incredible as this until the end of the year.
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio-based fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been voiced in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term 'sweet butter' or the withdrawal of conventional light bulbs from sale.
The quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic is currently imposing its banks' demands by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of the lobbying groups are also behind the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an 'abnormal curve'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogeneous national standards which complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, which claim that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize in this survey may be awarded to last year's EU regulation that inflatable balloons must bear a warning that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US survey which found that balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing in fair trumpets.
We have strange ideas at home too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this subject to Greece, anyone holding an official position within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for the stocks of foodstuffs that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, then exceeded the quantities set for canned mushrooms and thus faced a heavy fine.
The organisers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to certain countries because they have no access to the sea and to grant a grant to apply for a grant.
These ideas, however, do not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea is a handicap.
We will ask the European Union for a refund.' This was the view expressed in autumn 2004 by the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called 'interventionist' purchases, the State had been left with full stocks which it had then had to export.
Palas said the EU should have given us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without sea access.
The grants for the grant were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), and were to be used in the preparation of applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare".
While regulations are often criticised in the Member States, many experts say the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effective functioning of the Union and its overall development are worthy of praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects which have nothing whatsoever to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight which it does not always win) is a source of great emotion for the Czechs.
If after six years of fighting the Germans and the Austrians the Czechs successfully defended the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky', our producers had to replace the name 'Tuzemský rum' with the name 'Tuzemák' as it was known to us in the 19th century.
Only products made from cane sugar alcohol, not from beet sugar, may bear the name 'rum'.
The official EU list of registered products now includes globally known cheeses such as feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck cheese or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň carps ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr") and Žatec hops ("Žatecký chmel").
The Pardubický perník spice bread and the cakes called "Cornets de Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do we come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything was running smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see the country being plundered for the last 20 years, that thieves are not locked up and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I am over 40 and independent, not a member of any party, I have no other choice but to run for president or senate.
You entered the Senate but quickly made your way to the Castle.
Don 't you turn your backs on those who have chosen you ?
I always said I'd go into battle for the castle based on the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I was elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
My purpose is not the function, this is just a tool that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a nation are rallying in bars or in front of our television stations, but that we are trampling on those who are trying to make a difference.
Added to this is the press, which is defaming people and confusing free speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been claimed that I am bribing journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the themes of material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
You must change the law to that end.
As president, you don't have that power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, pushed for tourist guides to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, member of no party, I have a much better chance of winning the support of all the parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without any partisan dogma or categorization, to take from each party what is best for our country and put it into practice.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people put me more to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it doesn't really matter.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I am always in favour of any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I am equally impartial against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn 't what you said prove it ?
When you draw up a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get close.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been implemented around the world and talked about by renowned experts.
But without the support of parliament, you're left with nothing but slogans.
You won't survive in politics for long with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed in imposing, for example, material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other choice.
I have to convince the politicians, the journalists and the public and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to broadcast my request to the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors on live television.
If so, they should explain why they do not want to.
When there is a strong personality who identifies the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the direct election of the president, which was achieved through public pressure.
I confess, without hesitation, that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I've just entered politics and I'm trying to get the majority's support for my program.
I'm trying to get things done on my own, and if it doesn't work out, I'm gonna quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, so I went to a number of celebrities and asked them to run for the Senate as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the oil fraud.
I came here because people are really unhappy, but now I'm hesitant.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, was to vote for a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're the only two independents.
The people have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
I will fight for my vision, for example, the direct election of mayors and prefects.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check every potential member's past for stainless, and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand in my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have a land in Prague worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a childhood dream: I always liked James Bond, who drove cars, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth $60 million, and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don 't want to invest your own money ?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors clearly shows that my programme is not attracting much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are largely covered by the salary I'll receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn't run for any elections.
So you 're going to continue your business activities to make a living ?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities on hold?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As promised, I have reduced my activities to a certain extent.
For example, my assistant will be running the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan saving the Republic.
I must have something to live on.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I was earning and I'm still earning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business activities.

The architects of MVRDV prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination.To see for yourself, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it looks very futuristic, something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer engineer at a large company nearby, says: "Yes, it is indeed a beautiful building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everybody has the Internet, an iPad, e-books.
No one goes to one of those sleazy libraries of their own free will, does he?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping village that has nothing attractive on the outskirts of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 people has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brain, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture by reproducing the seven fictitious bridges on the euro notes in the form of beautiful miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has been limited.
The city authorities realized that there was only one way to get their hands on the statistics - by building a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam architects' office MVRDV, master of bold stick drawings and designer of spirited and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, puzzled and shouldering, the disgruntled Maas piled up his choice of books in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his activist-backed speech with a: "Dear Common!"
Here is my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the $30 million mountain came crashing down.
The building is part of a revitalization project which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus this small, dull village, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunningly ugly town hall, whose white facades suggest that it houses a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under the cheese bell.
Although an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, the real joys of reading and architecture are unlocked when you step on the floor of the building and discover its topography.
The interior, entirely made of glass, is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant light fixtures speak unequivocally the language of the municipal public squares.
The city atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for the eyes of the public benches, the dogs and the little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Normally, the library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal", explains Willy Maas.
We've completely upended the conventional spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been carefully designed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and the technical centre of the building.
One particular beauty is the library's black beams, which are sometimes sheets, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircases.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the most skilled architects and building engineers don't want unfamiliar materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a reply to the Standard.
One day we found ad hoc agricultural waste in a frizzled farm.
In the Netherlands, one millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time, in such quantities, into plates four centimetres thick.
Under heat and pressure, the 'Landbouwplastic' (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark, homogeneous and durable material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
These create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal humidity level of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology", says Trouborst.
The building's temperature is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun shines for only a short time inside, even on fine days.
Thick wooden beams mounted across the glass facade serve as a sunshade, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds will take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computer scientist mentioned earlier, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul at last found" by Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This was a way to fill the empty library, which was not yet fully filled - it now contains 70,000 books.
The concept is a success.
The rays are pouring in from all sides.
According to architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library".
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration".
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline called, in professional jargon, "creating an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page in literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
It is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role".
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the State of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why would you do that?
Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have difficulty in taking a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to introduce a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are thus facing several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find that role, but they are on the way to a more 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
What, then, does the term 'normal' foreign policy mean in practice for Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, i.e. by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers: Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Has this economic interest influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and the abstention at the UN vote?
Germany has first of all important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
So Berlin must be careful not to offend the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
I would not, however, attach too much importance to this, because it is not a relationship which is exclusively one-sided.
But this is at least a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by abstaining from important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
I therefore think that the rift is not as serious as it was in the case of Libya.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are mixed.
The United States, on the other hand, has made its veto clear.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene in America.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is far from over-enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Does Germany have difficulty in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States with the position of the major European partners?
I don't think it makes things any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must assert their singular position.
That is what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that Germany will be a driving force in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This has always been a delicate question.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which will give them more independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is she still having trouble taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still having difficulty in playing a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany decides to weigh more, there is a lot of anti-German sentiment.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States in this respect.
She has to deal with neighbors and very different opinions, and that is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling that void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant and even if they're less appreciated, that's life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America work together to analyze the challenges facing the transatlantic community.

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark is thus protected so that the undertaking bearing the name cannot bring an action.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd win.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with the firm Taylor Wessing specializing in property rights infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes on my desk.
The copyists only need a few more letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we're going to register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we're going to register Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a file containing the records made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, you can find multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeit goods.
The Pattloch case, however, is different: his clients instruct him to tackle the fact that the Chinese trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name which is already protected in another country.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is the term used to describe women who marry wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, and we have to fight this trend", Pattloch demands.
"Brand is sweetened, singularity is lost, reputational damage is enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs for the sectors concerned are in the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury market in the world, with an annual turnover of EUR 15 billion.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the trade mark register and these procedures are costly.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions cases in which the court dismissed the complaint because after a long period of time the name under criticism had become a "market reality".
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought out concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use a logo that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the acquirer of Volvo, used a blue and white logo that was reminiscent of BMW's.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to beachgoers from Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the famous crocodile's gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO Trade Mark Office in Beijing, however, admits that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office was reportedly transformed last year from a "work emergency to a return to normalcy".
The number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has thus fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain pending at the office.
The cost of action
As is often the case in China, the figures are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and means that China is for the tenth consecutive time the world's number one for new deposits.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the bureau reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan in registration fees.
In other words, each recording earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or $160.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese pirate.
It is true that the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It is our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany", explains Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Office of Trademarks had therefore rejected the objection of the Municipal Court.
Freudenberg won the next two cases, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
The Need to Watch
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, demanding and costs us a lot of time and money".
It is also difficult to estimate the internal costs, and the archives have even had to review the records of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a "big six-figure sum of money" to settle the dispute, but to no avail.
"That's how you see what it means to us", Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to exploit unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg name in Germany for a shoe and leather company.
The company had long since abandoned the sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "There is a need for vigilance".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
They argue that it is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but rather that foreigners should "register in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Clap your hands, sing, help each other
The Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
This is the story of a link that spans far more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, you tap the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, women's scarps and men's moccasins, they're looking for rhythm by tapping the floor.
One, two, three, four.
Then the singers' voices slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they get angry, they get charmed, and they go along.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and songwriters from 23 to 69 years old came, from the human medicine geneticist to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to help yourself
The United Nations AIDS Programme (UNAIDS) estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the organization "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros less, we can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "singer of praise" in Zulu.
No one in this area can speak the Bantu language fluently, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany and now returns to its native region, South Africa.
For 8,733 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people with
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest huts of straw or earth and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because their parents died of HIV.
In Estjeni, we can see on a smaller scale the ills that beset Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the shortest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision is almost never accepted by the population, yet it has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immune deficiency virus and it is not uncommon for people to die in their mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village, and the Imbongis saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a schooling, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and give him a hot meal every day.
But just a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, an organization that has since been working almost professionally with the AIDS orphans of Eshtjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STDs.
What groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blennorragia are commonly seen in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of every five reported cases of syphilis in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhea, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV transmission among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, but about 20% of new HIV infections occur among this group.
Young people have a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in the last 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared with the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital abscesses, urinary pain, white discharge, lower abdominal pain, and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause pain or other symptoms and so remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they don't protect 100 percent.
This is because the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricant infection or close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners have regular sex-exams.
Most STIs that are detected early can be cured and late sequelae can be prevented.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but most importantly the funds raised by the choir singers through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well housed, perhaps in the home of one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, as old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them take in up to 14 orphans, provide them with a home and make sure that they arrive at school on time each day in their uniforms.
The orphaned child is taken to a safe place, the home of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals for more than 200 starving children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has established a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken houses. With the support of the US health organization PSI, the association has organized HIV testing for many residents.
This is not natural, because although the disease is well known throughout the country, it is still a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"AIDS is a real taboo", explains Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that involves sex".
That's pretty curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his extravagant lifestyle.
Polygamy in the place of democracy.
These state-sanctioned practices, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Yet, says Annette Lennartz, "condoms are on every street corner, but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh".
To promote cultural exchange, every two or three years the Imbongi choir members go on a trip to Southern Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people in the far end of the continent still know from apartheid times.
The bus full of white people singing in African languages is such a sign of appreciation that it not only generates good humor and joy, but sometimes even brings a tear to a few feared border guards.
The bus always takes them to Estjeni, where the choir members visit their stepchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Estjeni, you will find light", the people there say.
And after a flight of 8,733 miles back to Heidelberg, in front of those choirboys kicking their feet in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you also find the light.
Messenger: NASA has discovered the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published Thursday in the journal Science show.
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice sheet in the region of the planet that is permanently submerged in shadow.
This covering is estimated to be at least 30 centimeters thick and up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that have hit Mercury.
But no one is linking the discovery of water to the hypothesis of life on the planet, explains chief scientist Sean Solomon of the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help us understand how water and other elements essential to life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes, and tiny robots like the Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like tiny gaps through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition of the term.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, harder to identify, are the "newborns" in the birthing chamber of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region of star formation, called "W5", a rather unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer telescope has captured the blazing brightness of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust are forming new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic birthing chamber.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also called the "seven sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope makes the colors more noticeable.
In this infrared image, the helix nebula, like a red eye, is looking directly at the viewer.
It's 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent has earned it the title of North America.
The combination of the normal and the infrared photo makes for a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the great puzzles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving a trace.
One of the largest and clearest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
This photograph, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name trifidus comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), for three streaks of dust separate the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation Serpentary: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are rushing toward each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern fire wheel".
This picture from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the average household dust.
This picture was made from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows the circle of black holes that lies 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The celestial cradle is always giving birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, are also constantly creating young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy of light rays and a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly made up of hydrogen.
The major telescopes - Our view of the universe
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow larger and larger, allowing us to see farther and farther into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this picture was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge - the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter of the crater is still about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its special feature is its great ability to collect light.
Despite its relatively small diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for signals from extraterrestrials using the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone with a computer can help in the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) by contributing the computing power of their machine.
View of the southern European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a facility worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for ESO's site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach an impressive height of 42 meters, and it will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors, each one 10 feet in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope is also planned to be built on Mauna Kea, and its mirror diameter will reach 30 meters.
This illustration is a source of admiration.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets, primarily those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This picture shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space in early 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope's missions will be to find light ejected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's south pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data exists on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data has been showing the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now know for sure.
Drink butter every day, and live to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, where you're still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, where you're still relatively young at 97.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a romantic affair.
At the many turns of the road, the bus sweeps along forested hills, flowing rivers, and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, almost like the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group called the Talysh, about whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and have a very long life span.
The end of the line, Lerik.
The small town is a bit of a mess with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that doesn't quite fit the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too arduous.
The trip takes eight hours, since the road is only one lane long, some 200 miles (323 km).
The province has yet to take advantage of the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world", Fatulayeva explains.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can see the life of about eight dozen Talyshs in the region who are over 100 years old.
This is my grandfather, he lived to be 120 years old.
Having another baby at 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who is said to be 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And when you consider that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973", says Fatulayeva.
The man reportedly married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he conceived another daughter.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong by a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the old man from Central Asia.
"There are also people who are incredibly old in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", explains Scholz, "and in Sardinia there are men who live incredibly old".
However, it is impossible to establish scientific proof because of the absence of documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, the fact is that people in the Lerik area often live to the age of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, a tourist guide in Azerbaijan, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
But Fatulayeva, the museum director, thinks it's a matter of diet.
However, it does not seem nutritionally plausible that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who enjoy meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a cockroach, tirelessly beating its contents.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long since grown up.
Two little kids are also playing around the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests and served in typical armored cups shaped like a belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long hairstyles of a dark blond, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost it and kept it in color.
"I have never used shampoo", Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate what came from her own farm - tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never bought food in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But things got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is astonishing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who ruled his country as a dictator, is almost unlimited in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) per month for her pension, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-haired son is right: "The elderly are held in great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "Rights of Man" Omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep division of the country.
The proposed constitution based on Sharia law is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president is not a cheapskate with his emotional words.
We must make the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the people as a whole, but also, and especially, to the Coptic Christians, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secularists.
Because all the members of the confused and hopelessly disunited opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, USA, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the majority Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour nightly tour of force are indeed somewhat disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal latitude to enforce a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, it is suggested by a newly introduced article stating that, in all matters relating to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will oversee the legislative system, which would in fact mean that the judiciary would be placed under the guardianship of the government.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's rule, these courts were used to suppress dissent.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, the draft says, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of art, cinema and literature.
In short, it would be simply censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids insulting or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording that suggests it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore open to interpretation in the draft law which Morsi is putting to a vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians "very soon".
"The revolution is reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concordat in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to abolish Sharia law before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the garbage bin of history".
On the instant messaging service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "coup against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for", said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges announced that they would not oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was being held outside Cairo University.
The veiled women and Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
"Clean our country!" they demanded of Morsi, claiming that "the Koran [was] their Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would have quickly led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud.
They say it is time to let the people decide by ballot what direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood in prison and in court under Mubarak.
He did so, not because he shared their worldview, but because he believed that human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, tried, and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even mentioned once in the new Constitution", he lamented in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's extension of powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are a blatant violation of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto taking away all its powers", says Saeda.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which watches the battle between different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It might be worth it.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will not be able to control".
The Norwegian rakfisk: Is it the most odoriferous fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country's success be the local appetite for a fish that smells extremely good?
Have some advanced cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of wet, dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular foods.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the scenery is spectacular - and the smell is pervasive.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When it gets dark and it gets cold, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit", explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
People around us swallow small pieces of fish and drink a large amount of it.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk", adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, that's not bad - it reminds you of sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, when before refrigeration was invented, fish were immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, when the fish had been well fermented, it was taken out and - no doubt with the senses weakened by the alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - over 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, are crossing the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though fragrant, part of Norway's past.
It's part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 euros each.
Norway is not often mentioned in international news, which is not to displease him.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this killing, they refer to it as the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could commit such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has been rich from its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success", explains our waitress Anna, with blond hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, holding a rack of rakfisk.
We are - as you say - cautious people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its stock market tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow and I'm waiting in line to buy something to eat - I've had my dose of rakfisk.
The menu is a hamburger made of moose, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stay is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most fragrant of them.
There's a TV show where the host wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, possibly from the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fishy excrement.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is having a rough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are common in normal weather, a security barrier has been in place since Monday, blocking several key roads in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching the Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
He's got a complicated task ahead of him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, thanks to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of some 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.
Before his meeting with the President of the United States, Mr. Pena Nieto was the Governor of the State of Mexico.
A sprawling, densely populated state surrounding the capital, opinions on his favorite land are divided as to who will be the new leader.
A straight man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is a well-known symbol.
The locals attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, which were once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting changes", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
In terms of security and the economy in particular, we hope for the real change that our country so badly needs.
After 81 years of uninterrupted rule, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He dismissed criticism from opponents who accused the new president of lacking charisma.
He's a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent statesman and, above all, he's a good listener.
However, people do not always have that image of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more stark.
Hidden beneath the highway intersections, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help fight drug gangs that are rampant in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly severe there.
In one disaster area, dozens of women were found dead in a landfill in the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico during Mr. Pena Nieto's tenure as governor, a rate far higher than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women killed there.
The critics of Mr Pena Nieto say that at best he failed to curb the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a typical concrete house in this run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version is that Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed that her body had been washed", says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the stiffness of the corpse had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana hangs on the wall, next to a cross with the word "Justice" written on it.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to believe what they say and shut up.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions", she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will come with a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make it a priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor", said Olvera, a member of Congress from Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of mistreatment that Bradley Manning was allegedly subjected to while in custody.
The trial concerns Manning's detention at a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction occurred under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of initiating the largest leak of classified information in the history of the U.S. military -- missed many opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he claims he suffered while in military detention.
In a cross-examination of Manning during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Major Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- in a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that Manning's case be dismissed on the grounds that the abduction occurred under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently harsh punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were later published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms the officers had filled out after meeting Manning, while he was being held at the Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein discussed the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was generally "very professional".
The forms do not record any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns orally about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the problems raised.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after they had addressed the concerns), and that didn't mean I hadn't raised problems", Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had convened to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention at the meeting was to have his restrictive status amended to indicate a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to have my status removed... so that I could have a better quality of life from my point of view", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide while in Kuwait and once fainted from the heat.
He added that it was very distressing not to have been informed of what was about to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours, sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only things he had were a mattress, a blanket, tights, clothes, and his glasses.
He tried to keep moving, as sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also stated that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about the treatment Manning suffered in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about an allegation in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questioning on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he should drop his blanket that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he was supposedly trying to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic band of his underwear or his flip flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences while in detention and will significantly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty before a court-martial, a trial that is scheduled for early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight for the dropping of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention for all inmates at Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmission of information relating to national defense.
If all the charges are upheld, he's facing life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked into the lobby of the customs and immigration department and felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for "Mexicanos" (Mexicans) and another for "Extranjeros" (Foreigners).
I stood motionless for several seconds, not knowing which row to head to.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It is an ethnic qualifier, just as my friends in Boston use it when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for any special qualification or line of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I grabbed my American passport and headed to the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Usually when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite topics are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk it in the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he didn't provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and bitter.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory in writing at the point of a gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
So, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason why there are so many Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, maybe a relative or a grandparent, didn't find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, that person was a typical profile -- dark-skinned, low-educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream right now, and we've gone to good schools, and we're in good situations, we should never lose sight of the fact that it's the American dream that we're living, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
We also know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they stare at us as if we were individuals of inferior race and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
They think our existence is a failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they never would have left.
And we wouldn't be stuck on the wrong side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels part of two countries.
And many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they belong in one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the music of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little bit more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a wonderful country that is absolutely worth visiting and press political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, given the widespread wage inequality, corruption, and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to fend for yourselves, amigos.
It's all right.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans are still angry at them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is yet another failure for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
As the same futile arguments about who started the war continue, dozens of buildings have been destroyed; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has blown everything up, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify even more.
Yet, there is every reason to believe that it could help them out of this deadly stalemate.
A war that makes no losers and no winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire agreed on November 21 remains in place, the fighting this week has strengthened the forces on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast that they forced the Israelis to surrender, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
After killing some of its leaders and repatriating the 1.7 million people of Gaza to one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals in Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
And Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a rising regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken a stand for Hamas; so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members are jubilant and say that the Islamic crescent is bending around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah militia is dominating, to Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can topple Bashar al-Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more easily left to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a major player that cannot be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the hardliners of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been reduced to a box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their hands and knees for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
But most importantly, Israel has prospered, especially under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, in part because of the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicose party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman, in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the upper hand.
Why spoil these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were running the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they come out.
Perhaps the hardliners will win, but perhaps the Arab Spring will change the game.
Even if the Islamists who are taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to tackle problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is good news -- and could be the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is bound to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories - much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to call out Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by the outside.
The answer remains that of the reasonable people on both sides, and of most of the outside world and of this newspaper: two states, with Israel's ceding territory in exchange for security.
One hope, short and long term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now speed up the cessation of arms flows to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the outside world should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, he seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow view.
Stability in the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
It goes through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Neutral cigarette packaging laws are in force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs are all over the dark green packages, which are all identical, regardless of the brand.
This law, which came into force in Australia, is a world first, with the logos and colours replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of diseased organs and depictions of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small letters on all the packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said that the aim was to dissuade young people from smoking by removing all glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even at a very young age, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image", said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that found, for example, children associating the crown of a logo with a princess".
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would revive the black market, which would make it easier to get cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be harmful consequences of this legislation", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had given them a boost in activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said that demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the ugly packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's High Court.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock replenishment.
Business is good for us.
The only drawback, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and have only a small display window to advertise your products, the Internet is the place to be", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video, or whether this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging compulsory in 2001.
Such warnings are now in effect in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Tighter laws are currently being considered in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain unresponsive to such pictures.
I don't mind the photos.
I don't know them.
"You take a cigarette and put it away", said Victor El Hage as he bought a pack with a picture of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is because of my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the shelves.
"I used to take an hour to unload a package, now I take four hours", Yu said.
"The government had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's fine, we stop and put the key under the door", he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had ample time to think about the subject of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
It forces the brain to take interesting paths, and it even feeds creativity.
And because we're, for the most part, constantly in front of different kinds of screens, we no longer experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
- I know.
And no, you didn't.
But I'll get back to you.
First, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History".
"The trouble goes back a long way", he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti evoking boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there's the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing numerous publications and submitting the idea to a panel of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that involves "wanting to do something, but failing to engage in satisfying activity".
What distinguishes boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not doing a task even though he wishes to.
With apathy, he says, there's no urge to do anything.
At the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, combined with a dull mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two may be related, bored people tend to think the problem is from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem is from themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when in fact it's a concentration problem.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape recording of a person's voice reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the overly loud sound of a TV show that had nothing to do with it, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who listened to TV at a low level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or demanding task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you are doing a boring task, "like looking at objects on an assembly line, music can help you to avoid boredom".
In fact, he says, we now know that when we twitch or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still", said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at one time or another - my flight being late, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "boredom predisposition scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes statements like, "Many of the tasks I do are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all".
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and they need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quick to get carried away.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when not at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the rates of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its peak", partly because children and teenagers have little control over what they want to do.
If I ask you again, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble, or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers point to a connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you you should do something else", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do is.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play the guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or to regulate himself, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation is changing from one situation to another", he says.
Your child is not just learning to have fun; he is gaining more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant buzz of activities and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees with you on that point.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a keen, frantic desire to be connected to something that has meaning", he said.
He says what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get started when the noise stops".
No guidelines for the new marijuana law in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco in Colorado is charged with what will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment for his consumption - misdemeanors, each of which was accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date to appear.
"We are treated like criminals", said Mr. Orozco.
But is he?
During the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of low-drug use cases depends more on location than law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of marijuana-related offenses have been closed without a trial.
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 and older for underage marijuana possession, as the law will go into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for accelerated marijuana cases and continue to prosecute people who possess marijuana.
Meanwhile, several cities from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains are currently voting to ban the opening of state-licensed marijuana shops in their neighborhoods.
"Things are changing so fast that I don't know what the future holds", said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to set up a licensing system, allowing production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and that's a good indicator", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we can base ourselves", he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal loophole, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees adequate access to legal marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis shops within a 30-km radius around a school, park, playground or day care center.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to establish a licensed cannabis business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Cannabis Legalization, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop charging people for this type of crime "with immediate effect".
Chief Oates said police would enforce the new court orders that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, embodies a more rigid view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are facing other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those who committed a crime which at the time of the offence was a recognised offence", said Mr Buck.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer bringing in adults for possession of restricted amounts.
The county prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to immediately close all marijuana possession cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a proper legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"It's a cultural barrier" to prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it's legal", he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use on the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become a case in point for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are planning a new frontier for legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting directives from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of legalizing marijuana hope the Justice Department will relent.
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it is true that police are unlikely to break down doors to seize small bags of drugs, it is likely that they are opposed to licensed businesses selling marijuana for personal use that are permitted under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado didn't wait for the federal government to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the establishment of new marijuana businesses, even if it is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and it's expected to impose that ban next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we end up with a federal problem", said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against that amendment.
We're interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and expelled from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It is not only students today who are attacked for their opinions.
As long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what I considered to be a prominent place of knowledge, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheater that fosters the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late '80s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university because I objected to undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said flatteringly that I had left after being forced to drink from cracked cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I had been bullied and constantly bullied.
Not because of my rather extravagant name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why bring it up today, you ask?
Well, recent studies have found that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred among Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded that their rights be protected, along with those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Student Chamber (JCR) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted" because of their political views.
They want to have a representative on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not eased by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which focused on student politics and depicted the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
One of the exhibits was a student named Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drives a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and uses a chrome-plated cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats for the implementation of higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members", she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, at the age of 18, and with a paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The year before, the university had voted to refuse to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was full of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the week, when the new students met each other and the professors, I had a taste of what was to come.
I found that not only did the teachers participate in the sarcasm of Tory students, but they actually enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on miners striking, privatisation and the government's opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were etched into the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was subjected to was about an English translation of 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a short man with a pustular face, was easily offended.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes burned with tears.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time - if you're not too busy making friends", he said in a harsh tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most young Tories claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
That plan failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're contaminated.
Other students took the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do Tories make love?" one of them asked.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just led a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have joined Labour and renounced my views?
The next three years were going to be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of her speeches.
He was hardly ever there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, and his adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he said.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' home in London, seeking refuge with my more open-minded city-dwelling family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his time at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the dreamy bell tower city.
Even my Communist friends were impeccable.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure he's just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also named Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a lecture the following week, when another history professor made the most serious suggestion in the world, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame, I admitted that I had been brainwashed by my parents and called them "old fools".
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who stuck the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At the time, he was writing two columns in the Murdoch Press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a whiny wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school setting.
The most tragic of all was that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also has an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of Fashion", which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The fashion designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed and separate world of nobility.
The first room of the exhibition, which will be open until 3 March, will show an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino displays his personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from the modest tailor in the northern Italian town of Voghera to the international jet-set idol.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't smash their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived together in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his Gstaad cottage", says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is close friends with the beauties of the past, such as Marella Agnelli and Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza has also not forgotten the charisma of the fashion designer.
Several years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decorations, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go out of style, because his creations are works of art", she concludes.
The lineage parade of nobility
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He likes people with high-level education and the highest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-meter-wide podium offering a place to swap roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must scroll down the podium to admire a dream "audience" bearing Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and fur belonging to the Empress Farah Diba.
Among the models were names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like first love, "unforgettable".
I remember it perfectly.
These were a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift from him", said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor's muses.
"I prefer him to all the others because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he exalts our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're bright and they light up the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, in the late 1990s, this was possible.
I bought my first Valentino for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a skirt and a draped bust and a falling necktie.
"It was a dream come true", said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timelessness", explains the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the evening dresses of the couturier with "the utmost care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it conveys".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the tailor's name for his seamstresses) to make this dress of ivory silk with pearl inlays, 12 different types of lace, and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the foremost authority on the fashion press, this dress represents a historic high fashion event of the late 20th century, "the return of high-class customers".
For years, blinded by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of her clients' husbands.
"I always liked the refinement, the calm, the neat, the perfect look", says d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my closest friends.
"He was impeccable, the years had no effect on him".
If a princess says so...
The world's toughest job: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four dollars, volcano-carryers in Indonesia risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work hell.
That is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the Indonesian island of East Java.
He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas from the earth's interior solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large stones of sulfur, weighing some 70 pounds, he places them in two bamboo baskets and carries them on his shoulders through the steep paths.
It is only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb the distance at tortoise speed, keeping their balance and measuring their steps so as not to trip and fall into the cliff.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell dead from the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur mined.
Once at the top, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and they walk the three-kilometer-long (3-mile-long) stretch of the scales, which a mining company has installed a little below, at an altitude of 1,800 feet [1,850 m].
The company, PT Candi Ngrimbi, has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, so to speak, its employees, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (€5 cents) per kilo of sulphur.
She then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (US$83) because the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees ($1,500) each trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each one takes him three hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (US$11.50) at the end of the day.
Although this may seem like a misery for such a superhuman effort, it's three times what he would earn in the field.
"The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees ($1,25) a day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees ($1,35)", says the porter who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not that difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and eyes irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he's spent three years of his life defying the danger on the Kawah Ijen, but sulfur has already started to pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and irritation of the eyes from the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This friendly, intelligent young man, who is worn out by life, might be a tour guide, a waiter, or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he is doing the work of a mule.
He shares a piece of unsanitary wood with other bearers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur keeps gushing at night, when his characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
Some 400 porters load the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanised the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work for themselves and are paid by weight.
They also do not get a penny of the 30,000 rupees ($2.50) per camera, plus the 15,000 rupees ($1.20) entrance fee that the park guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans", protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old heavy-duty porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left high school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kilograms, and he says he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of serious illness - in addition to their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only carry 50 kilos.
Each day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away, along a goat-trail filled with weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life", says Unainik, opening his mouth wide, revealing several missing teeth.
The oldest of her five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur porter.
Time passes, but misery endures from generation to generation. One of the most difficult jobs in the world, that of the human mules at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the absence of children on careers, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must grow".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let's fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem improbable that these words come from an advertisement for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a pin in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty".
It's only for the Internet, so we've been able to make it fun and entertaining.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in terms of births, so we felt that this was a topic we needed to address.
We knew the government had tried a lot of things like throwing pheromone perfumes or having speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, what's more creative to solve this problem than to turn it into a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government doesn't take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriage and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative rulers and strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 as the renewal rate was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, says that this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"It has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to counter the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that show little disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are accused of pushing down wages and not integrating.
Increasing immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year had its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by introducing quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unintended Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to prevent many small houses from being built.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sale is very successful.
However, authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, the general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much faster than larger ones.
For that reason, it's much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in the wheel if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards raising the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district in the centre, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive, and education is expensive, so people put it off", says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to be able to have my money and my time", says another young man in his 20's.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for not having children.
So, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the final say.
What's private offline is private online.
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sphere or "the sphere of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is private property for under 16s?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social media?
Does he realize the dangers of posting events online that he would not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post", says ten-year-old Jorge, who has been using Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger for two years to explain the meaning of the word privacy.
"They're very secret, my mother may know them but not everyone", he says.
I post funny pictures or games on FB.
I also chat with my friends.
"I won't share any of my pictures or anyone who's being silly", he says.
The boy recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene pictures, naked people, crimes, or humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on Facebook and his 9 followers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
His mother's one of them, she knows the password to one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just posting them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends, in a fast way", he says.
He says he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Nor would he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask accounts, on the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people on his friend list.
"I don't worry about it because we have something in common, for example music", he says.
The boy said that no one approached him or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account", he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we now know as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A friend of mine's relative was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he says.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only passed it on in private".
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this young man posted pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or upset.
"Even though I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet started as a way of finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in education from Yale University and is the author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, the children and young people who are born with technology.
"We, the digital immigrants, are there to teach them, while we ourselves are learning", she says.
He adds that the subject is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is or is not appropriate to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what they care about most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers confidentiality is to use thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do it is no good", she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a picture of you like a friend you posted?
Do you know what other people post about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people's permission to identify them?
Also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every second?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks", she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor and primary school teacher and counselor, says that it is vital that parents carefully read the terms and conditions for using social networking sites.
Understanding each term will provide a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish", he says.
Guardia says it's vital to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VIth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it had been announced earlier and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit closed, then claimed that it would be published at some point on the website of the Peruvian government.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been explained by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Access to information on the summit by journalists has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the audio-free video of the presidential meeting with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information that circulated among journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the governments of Unasur that attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released on the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American-Arab Summit (ASPA) and on that occasion, although it was urged by the press, it also did not release the so-called Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the access to information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru agreeing jointly to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleadings of both parties in the trial Lima has filed against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and implement the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today", President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts", added President Piñera, shaking hands with President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact, in which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, following a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandate read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would take "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He said that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to low-cost internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to foresee a better future for our people", President Humala concluded.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connectivity of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects were for Peru and were located on the transverse axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and in good relations with its neighbours, was another topic discussed at the Summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before the start of the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", President Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require a discussion with that country", he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", added President Santos.
President Santos and President Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship", says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe".
President Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told state television TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas which we want to make a thing of the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories to the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who are trying to talk us out of it are never compromising, but we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but has instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
It concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be adhered to".
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to submit to an interrogation in his own country for a suspected sex offence, whereas "Swedish law itself allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious", the Ecuadorian president said.
Being confined to a small space without the possibility of exercising in the open air may impair physical and mental health.
"It affects the health of everyone", he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a passport that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he points out that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there were ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings before different European bodies", he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the safe passage tomorrow, it would be over".
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has done in other cases, were to interrogate Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interrogate him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa used this opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of press freedom and made it clear that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil politicians or the perverse but the bad journalists who pay for greed, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this respect, he praised that it was not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than emphasizing his reelection, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considered as 'perfectly relevant' the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which would strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not being respected.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We must solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the successful resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that it was "beneficial for Latin America to bring the matter before international bodies if both countries agree to accept any firm ruling".
Referring to the possibility of his running for a third consecutive term in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, he said he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the February 2013 primary, he will retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility", he said.
If I win, it will be my last term as president and I will retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I'll lose too.
"It's my decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez", he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now the result of late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he tested positive for HIV.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head", he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and started to find out about it and his tenacity was so great that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the longest-serving patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he was admitted in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something that was hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigmas.
So even the director of one IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was voiceless".
In those days, AIDS was death.
Today, it is possible to survive the syndrome and enjoy a good quality of life.
However, many people, unaware of their illness, still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "deplete" their immune system and fall victim to opportunistic infections.
31 years after the start of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes as reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system impairment patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for those with CD4 levels of 200 and up to 50 years for those with CD4 levels of 500.
Simply put, this means that for someone diagnosed as HIV positive at age 25, "as long as he remains under control, he can live safely until age 75", explained the scientist interviewed.
To put this progress into context, we must know that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
While it is true that the death rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in Mexico the number of deaths from AIDS increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
For the last 12 years at least, we've never run out of drugs, and the problem is that patients come in very late stages because they don't know they're infected, or they find out at the late stages of the disease.
It gives us a clear fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive with an opportunistic infection, and what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for that, to offer mass screening tests to all people who ask".
Specialists and members of the Jalisco State Council for AIDS Prevention (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to take his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and that, despite his young age, he was already HIV positive and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you find out you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't care.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better have a good time three times a week", they say, but I don't.
The change has been good, I eat right, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, all his parents know is that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them get tested, if they've taken risks, the sooner they know they're HIV positive, the better, and if they're already diagnosed, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the average citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packs of a hundred, that's very good, but the result is that even today, some people don't have access to condoms", he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?" asked sarcastically and with judgment by social workers, counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
He suggests that this inefficient distribution be refocused; that condoms should not only be sold at counters but be found in public toilets and in places frequented by young people.
This is not about promoting promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying for girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González said when asked if there would be condom distribution within his administration.
"That's not how sex works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active", he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases of AIDS (12,158 and 1,317 HIV).
The state is the 4th largest in the country in terms of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in terms of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A judgment upheld on appeal by a US court overlooks the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt agreed through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a bad precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighbouring country and solvency problems.
So it seems that the survival procedures of the Mexican companies authorized by the laws are not valid in the star-studded country, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge states that creditors must register under the U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy of Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, which recognised in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws allow this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the US courts, i.e. the 'vulture' funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have won a majority in any event.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A fact that the appellate court omitted.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation it had been in since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis facing the United States, which was spilling over the costs to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same court of appeal to have the vote taken in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious was that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, stating that this exempted it from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It also notes that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-party car-rail, they knock Vitro out and they knock the country out.
General accounting
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were kept quiet for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Pilots' Union Association has already run into problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied that it had provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust fund of IXE Bank on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares in the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're laying siege to the Dragon Mart.
Gathered at a Caribbean University amphitheater over the weekend, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for products from the Great Wall country, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone to oppose the monumental project which is partly located in protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Commercial Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was right that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long term homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, the real estate developer Homex has launched itself on the Stock Exchange market for 500 million pesos.
This securities issue is the first of four issues for which they offer to pay interest every 28 days.
The birth of Competival
A new consortium, with the name Competival, has just been formed, comprising the IT leaders NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, and is aimed at the Central and South American clustering software services market.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball world-trotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life connected to the field and, thanks to it, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor league player, a national basketball team player, a manager and executive of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s", Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, decorated almost entirely with photographs and memorabilia that recall his extraordinary itinerary, bear this out.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all his memories, those he cherishes most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I was lucky enough to compete in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
It has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team", Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was the manager here at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and he said, "I have a big player for you. He's six feet tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who had been naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He rejoiced in the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy's burdens on the national team.
I remember when we first won it for the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian referee hadn't made us play the last game again", Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and we beat up the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the team that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the 90 World Cup because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individual, but it gave us a gold medal and a lot of joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner as replacements for players suspended by the imposture of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín has.
And that's without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. They were all very good.
I really like the work Leo Arill does with the youth.
What do you think is your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to have done, like the regionalisation of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys play only in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national play-offs.
Today's youths travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
At least I've seen the benefit of mandatory certification and training for managers, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
I usually listen to music, watch YouTube videos of my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been there for me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman (born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas) became known worldwide for his leading role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a ruthless, fearsome, manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press by "Dallas" production company Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and its sequel, was with Hagman when he died at a Dallas hospital, his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Doctors diagnosed Larry Hagman with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and had a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman had made his television debut as an ordinary guy in the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In this one, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among her film roles are critically acclaimed roles in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was through his masterful rendition of the deliciously abominable J.R. that Larry Hagman achieved his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?" invented to keep the suspense around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars in betting.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers were in front of their screens, making "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. had gotten her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't leave town, but other people had reasons to assault her, too.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but charismaticly smiling man: a dishonest entrepreneur and unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) committed.
"I know what would be an epitaph for J.R"., Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is Honest Citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The network has already completed filming five episodes for the second season and a sixth is in the works, the network said.
At this time, neither Warner nor TNT has commented on how Hagman's death will be incorporated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who achieved fame with classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 while married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the New York theater stages in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met and married the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his memoir, "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I have written nothing in this book that could hurt or affect anyone in any way", he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor advocate and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I give them advice, I give them confidence, I go with them when they come for surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I try to offer them a little comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it's not going to be easy for a while, but it's going to be okay".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course on "The End of the World" has just begun
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew he was setting a formidable trap: the end of the "great countdown" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the impending end of the world.
But Professor Charme had no idea what awaited him in the months to come: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have dubbed "Armageddon of debt", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists thought the apocalypse would break out.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever had", Professor Charme told his students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If you analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and you tell it, it was a very good time.
And remember, bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only professor to be teaching about "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
At Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students will analyze apocalyptic-themed films and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to teach a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We're adding '2012' to give us the opportunity to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't disappear", said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be taken the night before the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The classes have proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours", said Restall of his 35-student course for advanced students.
We received e-mails several weeks before the semester started from people asking if there was still room.
The students, on the other hand, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves", says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology at Rutgers-Camden University in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort, or no comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course teaching this subject", he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students we interviewed, let alone one professor, told us to believe in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and we kind of discredited it", says 21-year-old Temple senior Julie zegle, from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it's just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I'll admit that there's an apocalypse anxiety in Western culture that goes back centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in such speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it", he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching classes in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being held here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not part of the end of the world", he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years many supposed dates of the last judgment have been discussed, and he claims that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several of them told us that they thought they were going to parties "at the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together", said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
