When a small group of living beings (small population) split from the main population from which it originates (as if they cross a mountain or a river, or if they relocate to a new island, so they can't easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one where they were before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population will have, to be a strong competitor, to have different characteristics or adaptations than those they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.

The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, either marking the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of different effects depending on the type of mutation, on the severity of the wrapped piece of genetic material and on whether the wrapped cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the cells of a germ line can pass to children, whereas mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
