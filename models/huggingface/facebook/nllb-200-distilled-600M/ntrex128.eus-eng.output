Members of the Welsh Assembly have expressed concern that they will be treated as puppets.
Several members of the Assembly have expressed displeasure after hearing a proposal to change the name of their office as MWP (Member of the Legislative Assembly for Wales).
This idea came about after the plans to rename the Assembly of the Legislative Assembly of Wales were developed.
Members of the political assembly are concerned that this plan is a good way to mock them.
A member of the Labour Party at the meeting said the following in English, which rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp.
If you are from outside Wales: in Welsh, the word twp means inozoa and the word pwp means kaka.
A member of the Scottish assembly has said the whole team is not very happy and suggested that a replacement name be sought.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party has also said he is "reverent" to new ideas to change the name, but has also expressed concern about the rumors that the MWP changes could bring.
To better understand this conflict, it is important to note that the Welsh letter w and the English letter u of Yorkshire have a similar pronunciation.
The committee of the assembly, which is preparing a legal draft for the name change, has stated that: As regards the members of the assembly, they shall have sole responsibility for choosing the descriptors they wish to use.
According to the 2017 Welsh Government Accounts, the Welsh Assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to select proposed proposals and, in general, the names of the Welsh Legislature received numerous expressions of solidarity.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Member of the Welsh Legislative Assembly or WMP (in English acronyms), but the name MWP chosen was decided in a public consultation.
Members of the House, on the other hand, suggest alternatives, but it can be extremely difficult to unanimously choose a choice, especially for House Speaker Elin Jones, who had to submit a draft with the changes in a matter of weeks.
However, the legislation of the changes to be made will affect the functioning of the assembly; among other things, rules will be created to prevent activities that would cause the members of the assembly to lose their good name and the design of the assembly system will be managed with the help of that law.
When discussing a change in legislation, members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to review and decide on their names.
The Macedonians will participate in a referendum to change the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held to settle a long-standing dispute with Greece (which has a province called Macedonia) over the past decades.
The government of Athens has long stressed that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly blocked its application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change, has said he will not attend the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev) say it is only a price to pay for joining the UK and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church lose their voice because of the problems facing the churches of Harlem.
"I've spoken to a lot of older people and they used to say that you could find a bar and a church in every corner", Mr. Adams says.
But now there's nothing.
He says it's normal to disappear from bars.
People use other methods to socialize, he explains.
The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people used to gather.
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of assets won't be enough and sooner or later we'll be back at the starting point.
Also, churches can be replaced with housing and the neighborhood's shrines will be built with properties filled with people who don't care.
The people who will buy properties will be white people says eta, which is why churches will shut down quickly because these new people are not members of the churches congregations
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a black metropolis; it was the Metropolis community of 1870 and St. Martin's was built a decade later.
In 1930, the original Methodist congregation left the neighborhood.
After that, a group of black people took over the relay.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the Congregation of the Black Reverend John Howard Johnson, and Howard organized a boycott against the stores at 125 Commercial Street in Harlem, which did not hire or promote black people.
The church suffered extensive damage in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners designed several plans to rebuild the church and commissioned the carillon to be collected.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, named the bell "The Poor People's Bell".
The expert who played the carillon in July gave it another name: Treasure of Culture and Inreplaceable Historical Instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ngek of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first carillon played by a black musician in the world; the musician, Dionisio A. Lind, went to play a larger carillon in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explains that St. Martin's has not replaced his musician.
In recent months, St. Martin has witnessed the tiring comings and goings of several architects and contractors; some of them brought by lay leaders or bishopric dioceses.
The parish council (the artistic council composed of lay leaders), on the other hand, sent a letter to the diocese in July to verify that the costs incurred by the recruitment of these persons would pass to the parish, since the parish is not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Several church members have filed complaints about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy while hunting for oysters off the coast of California.
According to the police, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was hunting for oysters off the California coast on the first day of the oyster season.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. on Encinitas Beacon Beach.
According to Chad Hammel, who told San Diego's KSWB-TV channel, he was swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning, but his friend heard him screaming for help; then he swam with a group of people to his friend to help him out of the water.
Hammel, who lived in the past thought his friend was screaming for joy because he found an oyster, but then realized that the friend was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I got bitten!
"I could see his entire clavicle", said Hammel, after seeing his friend.
And I called out to all the people, and said, Bring him out of the water, and there is a shark. And Hamel cried out, and said,
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The species of the shark that attacked was not detected.
Captain Larry Giles of the Rescue Team has reported to the media that they saw a shark a few weeks ago, but the species was determined to be safe.
Giles also indicated that the victim's wounds were on the upper part of the dress.
Police have blocked access from Casablad's Ponto Beach to Swami Beach in Encinitas to conduct a 48-hour investigation to ensure the safety of the public.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the sand, but most are not dangerous.
The Sainsbury's supermarket plans are to enter the UK cosmetics market.
Sainsbury's supermarket has taken over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers a range of beauty styles in the supermarket with a variety of expert and specialized staff.
While sales of fashion and household goods are declining, 2.8 billion pounds have been invested in the UK beauty sector, which is growing unabated, and larger beauty stores will be built and tested in 11 stores across the country. If the results are good, more stores will open next year.
With the investment in beauty, the department stores that sold televisions, microwave ovens and household products can be taken advantage of by supermarkets.
According to Sainsburys supermarkets, it will double its beauty product offering and offer more than 3000 products; it will also place Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands in the hands of customers.
As for the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, they'll have more space in the area-marked areas, like the areas you can find in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is re-introducing its branded make-up Boutique, which is a completely vegan product; younger buyers are increasingly demanding such products.
In addition, the fragrance shop will try the fragrance offered by the fragrance seller at two Sainsburys supermarkets, the first opened in Croydon (south of London) last week and the second, in Selly Oaken (Birmingham), will open later this year.
Because of online shopping and the tendency to shop for food in small local stores every day, supermarkets must work head-to-head to attract customers.
Mike Coup, CEO of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said retail outlets will adopt the style of supermarkets and the supermarket chain will reduce the threat of rivals Aldi and Lidl by offering more products other than services and food.
The Sainsburys supermarket has opened Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores and has opened several Habitats, following the purchase of both chains two years ago; as a result, food sales have strengthened and the purchased chains are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket tried to reopen its beauty and pharmaceutical department, but the strategy failed.
She then joined Sainsbury's Boots in the early 2000s, but that association was dissolved because the process of dividing profits from pharmacy stores in supermarkets had become paperwork.
A new strategy was put in place when Sainsbury's sold its 281-shop pharmaceutical business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the planned plan: it will add a large range of luxury skin care brands to four stores including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's supermarkets said, "We've improved the look of the beauty department so that our customers can find the perfect environments.
We've also hired highly experienced staff to give specific product advice.
We have designed our brand range to meet all requirements and, thanks to comfortable environments and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and easy choice in front of stores using outdated methods.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby cancelled his offer of £11 million.
The star of Dragons' show Peter Jones went mad after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million offer linked to the long-running brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, a brand that sells household goods and ingredients.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old anchor of This Morning used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Following Holly Willoughby's resignation to accept contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV, the star of the show "Dragons" became extremely angry at the last minute for leaving the lucrative business they had created.
According to our sources, a tense meeting was held on Tuesday at the headquarters in Marlow and as a result, Jones was extremely angry when he heard the explanation from our most famous woman on television that she would accept new contracts worth £1.5 million and, therefore, would not be able to spend more time on Truly brand household products and ingredients.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's fortune of £11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was quitting Truly's business, Jones left the UK to move to a holiday home.
A source said that this option has always been one of Holly's priorities.
That decision will guarantee her future for the next two decades.
But the decision to leave the mark has left us with a lot of mouths to grind.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because the offer for the mark was close.
"In fact, the warehouse in Marlow is full of products to sell".
According to experts, the company is on the verge of losing millions of pounds due to the departure of the host of This Morning (which is the UK's most profitable host); the company has invested a lot of money in various products (including pillows, candles, clothing and household goods) and will now have to deal with the possible delays.
Besides, that conflict could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, have been best friends for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as a director in March.
The two couples always plan their vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the M&S ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source in Jones's team said last night that he would not comment on his business activities.
It was a tough conversation, but then we fell in love.
He was joking about the media slander he was subjected to, all for making a "inappropriate" comment about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump used his voice as a TV host to answer the chats:
"I have not given anything".
After the first meeting in Singapore in June, President Trump said Kim wanted to hold a second meeting, which led to a tremendously important step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the nuclear disarmament process has stalled.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN world leaders: At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, North Korea has not seen any appropriate response from the United States regarding the country's steps towards nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the United States has tightened its sanctions to keep the country under pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more optimistic view, and he expressed it in his last speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are better than ever", he said.
And we were about to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people could die in this war.
But now we have this extraordinary relationship in our hands".
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results, including the completion of missile tests, improved hostage release processes, and the rest of the US military's delay is underway.
He also explains his unusual point of view regarding his conversations with Kim.
"The job of the president is incredibly simple, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to force their way into the country, we have 200 people here", Trump said as he pointed out the staff gathered there.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island and left hundreds dead.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, the support of international non-profit organizations was not needed.
Although 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the earthquake was not declared a national disaster (a prerequisite for seeking assistance from nations).
"In many cases, unfortunately, the government has made it clear that it does not need international assistance, so this situation is a challenge", says Ms. Sumbung.
Save the Children is building a team to go to Palua, but it's not yet clear if volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, representatives of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are working urgently to accept assistance from international agencies.
Despite the numerous earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has underlined measures to cope with the wrath of nature.
The tsunami-fighting forts have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few forts on the coast.
Palou doesn't have a siren to warn people and even if the warning is in effect, that may have caused so many deaths.
When the weather is good, traveling between the Indonesian islands can be challenging.
In addition, natural disasters make logistics more difficult to implement.
A hospital ship was anchored in Lombok to provide treatment to earthquake victims and is now heading to Palua, however it will take at least three days to reach the disaster site.
President Joko Widodo's campaign was based on projects to improve Indonesia's infrastructure and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, the funds have been reduced and the administration of President Jokowi is in a tight spot as it prepares for next year's elections.
Mr Joko also has trouble controlling sectarian tensions in Indonesia; for example, most members of the Islamic Party have taken a more conservative religious view.
As a result, more than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced because Christian and Islamic gangs have taken their fights to the streets, including using machetes, bows, arrows and similar weapons.
See, the Liverpool Daniel Sturridge draw against Chelsea.
The goal scored by Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, left Liverpool alive and the match against Chelsea was declared a Premier League loss.
Thanks to Xherdan Shaqiri's 30-yard walk out of Chealsea, Sturridge had the chance to change the score 1-0.
Before he kicked the ball into the door pole, he put it to his left.
That kick made the ball fly to the bottom and headed to the top right of the net.
The ball finally passed the protection of the Big Kepa and entered the net.
"Such players as Shaq always play on the upper side, so I wanted to get that position to get the ball; that's why I tried to get enough time", Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the song coming and, with one touch, the ball was in my feet, and after that I didn't have much time to think: I just took the opportunity".
After Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute, Chelsea were beating 1-0 in the middle of the game.
In that game, the blue team's forward returned a kick pass to Matthew Kovacic, who turned around in the middle of the field and ran to the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic was just playing a little bit of a game in the middle of the field.
Then he hit the ball with a big bang, and it was on the sand, right down to Hazard's foot.
Hazard passed the other team's defense and put the ball into the net of the gate pole which destroyed the defense of Liverpool's Alisson Becker with a blow made to his left foot.
Liverpool's next match against Naples in the Champions League group stage will be at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will also face the club at Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Tuesday, London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
According to the National Disaster Agency, the number of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832.
According to the press conference, after the representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho suffered a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and waves of 20 feet high on Friday, several people have been trapped among the ruins of buildings.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with building ruins.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for stabbing and killing a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mewse, John Street with stab wounds. A 32-year-old man has been arrested as the prime suspect in the murder.
The police have asked the people in the neighborhood if they see or hear anything, to call the police.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation has just begun, but if anyone saw or heard anything on John Street in Birkenhead, we'd like to get in touch.
We also want to ask for help from drivers of cars that can record, such as taxi drivers, because they may have information that is essential to the investigation.
On the other hand, a police spokesman confirmed that the woman found was living in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside a house.
That afternoon, several people who knew the woman arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police will be in contact with the victim's family.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to break into his apartment, but the police told him that no one can enter or leave the building.
When he heard about what happened, he was shocked.
Neighbors will have to wait a few hours before they can get into their homes.
A fellow police officer was talking to a neighbor and he was suggesting that the entire area would be taken as a murder scene.
Later, a woman came to the scene crying.
And he kept saying, "This is scary".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars entered the police station and another patrol was left outside.
Several police officers have searched the building's apartments.
Anyone with information can send a message to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers' phone number (0800 555 111); they simply have to mention the record 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the ultimate goal of the trend to rewrite history.
If it disappears, it will be poetic justice: just as the Taliban destroyed many religious objects, so did the Puritan fanatics of England with many historical and cultural objects in the country.
The Cromwell Society, however, says Mr. Crick's suggestion is "a nonsense" and that he "is trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, a spokesman for the Cromwell Society, said: "The debate over the removal of the statues of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster is inevitable; Cromwell has become an objective.
Cromwell himself never ordered or organized the iconic clashes of English civil wars.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the deeds of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The impressive representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of the 19th century's views and our historiography; some people still believe that the actions of this person should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "Few people believe this, yes, than in the 19th century, but still a few people believe that Cromwell was a champion of parliament against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about monarchy.
It will remain the heart of historical debate as to whether or not this person is an accurate representation of the person.
However, we can safely say that the conflict of the mid-17th century was the starting point of the development of our country, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties that took part in that starting point.
They may also be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements he had achieved by holding the title of Lord Protector".
A pig is killed by a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery and was bloodied in a pig market in Liupanshu, Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig herder is preparing to inject pigs in Xinjiang, Qinghai province, China.
He usually travels through Yunnan province on Wednesdays with his cousin at the 15 pigs market.
The next morning, her cousin found the body and found the door of the next pigsty open.
He also said that there was a large herd of pigs in the pigsty with blood in its mouth.
The court's analysis report confirmed that a 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
My cousin's legs were covered in blood and shattered his cousin, whose last name is Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. (Tuesday) to feed the pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan's belly or his cousin's.
According to a market leader telling the Evening News, the pig is locked up to prevent further attacks and allow the police to collect evidence of the location.
Yuan's family and the market leaders are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been several previous attacks by pigs.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig surrounded a Welsh farmer in his tractor until the man's wife drove the animal away.
In 2012, a pig farmer in Oregon ate his body and after that, a Manitoba farmer claimed in the CBC News news that pigs are not aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, it can act as a polluter.
"They love to play.
They're like children and they're so curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show respect, he said.
Small storms of the Rose hurricane will leave rains in the southwestern United States.
Weather warnings indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves into the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains in the coming days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa will produce winds of 85 mph and become a Category 1 hurricane.
So, we expect Rosa to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure point is forming in the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward to the west coast of the United States, with Rosa Baja on Monday heading to the California peninsula in a tropical storm and carrying tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Plus, Rosa is going to rain 10 inches on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical humidity will combine with low pressure and heavy rainfall will be expected in the coming days in the southwest.
In the local area, 1 to 4 inches of water can be dangerous because sudden flooding, waste streams and landslides can result in deserts.
Rainfall caused by high tropical humidity can leave 2-3 inches of water per hour and in specific places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of water is expected to collect in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Tropical rainfall is wanderlust, which can cause sudden flooding and erosion.
It is highly recommended not to go for a walk in the desert if a tropical storm warning has been issued.
Rain-crushes can turn canyons into violent streams and storms can bring wind and dust from the ball.
And as the pressure drops, there will be local showers along the southern California coast.
Rain can collect up to half an inch of water and can create small streams of debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the county.
Also, there may be some scattered tropical rainfall in Arizona on Sunday and Monday, but there will be more rainfall on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the rain will continue to rain in the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
October may see severe temperature changes in the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical temperatures will remain warm.
Sometimes these temperatures have large changes over short distances.
For example, there will be a major temperature change in the central United States on Sunday.
There's a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the summer heat will reach out and spread everywhere.
The central and eastern United States will have a warm October, with temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
Also, it could be 80 degrees Tuesday in New York City, which is roughly 10 degrees above the average temperature.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the eastern United States will experience higher than average temperatures in the first week of October.
Over 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's declaration.
More than 20 million people watched Tuesday's news broadcast of the sixth channel's astonishing statements by Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Forden, who accused Kavanaugh of sexual abuse in 1980.
Meanwhile, political conflict continued and the channel's presenters interrupted Friday's regular programming to deliver a last-minute news: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake agreed to a week-long investigation with the FBI.
According to Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her repeatedly while she was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In Kavanaugh's place, he made a bold statement saying he was absolutely sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen data, approximately 20.4 million people watched the statement on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, this figure was not immediately available for other channels that made the declaration, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people watching TV in their offices.
For example, we could say that the audience is comparable to a football final or an Academy Award.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's statement is fully accepted by the channel's presenters and averaged 5.69 million viewers while making the statement, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC had $2.94 million, MSNBC had $2.89 million and CNN had $2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the statement, the public's interest remained.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican Party announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS recorded Kavanaugh surrounded by protesters on Friday as he tried to take an elevator to testify before the Magistrates' Court.
She was seen live on CNN with her gaze down as protesters clashed.
I'm here, a woman said before you.
Do you really think he's telling the truth?
And she added, "You have extraordinary powers, but there are many women who have nothing".
At that point and before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a notice and would provide more details during the meeting's review.
Cable and TV broadcasts were broadcasting the show live every hour while the Magistrates' Conference was voting for Senator Kavanaugh.
However, Flake said he would vote after the FBI had examined the arguments against the candidate for a week, remember that the Democratic minority party was demanding that they do so.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake was almost confident in the investigation.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flake's decision was powerful because the Republican Party doesn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the arguments against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on the basis of Brexit
According to an interview in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of playing with the future of the UK and of weakening the country's interests.
On 29 September 2018, the British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party's speech in Birmingham.
In another interview that appeared on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized the plan for Brexit called the 'Game of Thrones' and said the taxes Britain and the European Union had to pay were 'totally ridiculous'.
Wayde Sims was shot dead, police arrested Dyteon Simpson for the murder of LSU's player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old college basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison for a second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Police have shared a video of Sims and Simpson's fight, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
According to the CBS affiliate, the police recovered the glasses from the scene of the murder and said Simpson's DNA was in them.
After Simpson was questioned, he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His lawyer said his bail was set at $350,000.
The Eastern Baton Rouge District Court office released a preliminary report Friday, which states the cause of death was a head-to-neck gunshot.
The Louisiana State Police Department's Department of Fugitive Detection, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the surrounding community are grateful for their help in finding the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Allava has thanked the police for their leadership and for protecting justice.
Sims was 20.
The two-meter player grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Wayden's death.
"These are the things that always worry you", Wade said.
A volcano is spreading ash over Mexico City.
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday and recommended that they stay away from the volcano after detecting various activity in the crater; 183 gas and ash spills were recorded over 24 hours.
Half the volcano also experienced several tremors.
According to images on social media, thin layers of ash can be seen in the windshields of cars in some neighborhoods of Mexico City (e.g., Xochimilcon).
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the volcano's activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the vote for independence, the struggle between the police and the Catalonian independents
Six people were arrested this Saturday in Barcelona, Spain, as independence protesters fought with riot police as thousands of people joined the parties to commemorate the first anniversary of the independence elections in Catalonia.
The anti-riot police stopped a disguised separatist group, but they threw eggs and paint dust at them, resulting in dust clouds on tourist-filled streets.
Later, more fighting broke out because the police were using their clubs to stop the fighting.
Also, pro-independence groups marched for hours, we will not forget, we will not forgive, singing in front of the unionists who were singing, Long live Spain.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the clashes.
There is a lot of tension in this region that seeks independence after the elections on October 1st, which were illegal under the Madrid government, but the Catalonian independents got a day to celebrate.
Most voters voted for independence, but the participation of the people was very small because of the number of citizens who wanted to boycott the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1,000 were wounded after the police attack, because voters went to the polling stations for the elections to stop voters, which led to violent clashes.
Independence groups camped out Friday to avoid a march in support of the National Police.
The march was held, but he was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician, who accompanied his wife to the independence march, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year we had a wonderful time.
My parents cried with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck.
After a pyrrhic but significant victory in the local elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have had many problems this year maintaining the public interest; some party leaders are being deported or arrested and are now awaiting trial for organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is recording a police march on her phone and says politicians from both parties are responsible for the situation.
"And then there's more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been in prison for the past year awaiting trial, announced that he would take part in the next year's European Parliament elections.
"If I run for office in the European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the reduction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government", he said.
Three men were arrested for hitting a house with a car.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for repeatedly hitting a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent, Tuesday evening at 19:30 (BST).
Detective Bob Blemmings said the building and its gates were damaged.
It also looks like a valve was used in the car.
With Menga's pitch, Livingston wins 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Mengas first goal confirms Livingston's height.
Livingston's promotion has impressed Rangers players and Steven Gerrard is on his second losing streak in 18 games as Ibrox's captain.
Dolly Menga's launch was a decisive one at Gary Holten's Hibernian as the team advanced to the second half.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will have to play against the Hearts leaders (who have eight more points) on Sunday.
Before that game, the Rangers will have to play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is undefeated with six games left in the season, and coach Holt doesn't know what a failure is since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a lot of opportunities with strong visitors.
Holten's team had to take the lead before scoring a goal, and his incredible accuracy caused him to cause a number of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost at the door and then Alan Lithgow redirected his efforts to the door after Craig Halkett's head was cut off.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play, but they knew the visitors could annoy them at any time.
And with that spirit, he scored the decisive goal.
The Rangers gave a free throw and Livingston created an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to score Menga, but the latter scored in the middle of the gate if he touched the ball.
At that stage of the game, the Rangers dominated the property, but home defense was impassable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly passed the game without any problems.
This pattern was followed until the middle of the second half, but Alfredo Morelos's throw required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman was unable to score because of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed Livingston's next move.
The passes were repeatedly entered into Livingston's arena and repeatedly removed by home players; two penalties were requested, Halkett for challenging rep Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand, but both were dismissed.
Livingston's game is a little bit of a joke.
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC in Scotland, Tony Macaroni in the Arena
Livingston's game was a great one and the result was perfect.
They've played some great games for me and they have a terrific chance of promotion.
The style of play and the team have changed little since they reached the first division, but Holt has been an outstanding coach: he has put the team on the right track since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett's job has been incredible, organizing and managing an unparalleled defense, and Menga has been responsible for keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
The Rangers were not very inspired, though.
They're doing great when they're under the command of the Warrior, but they've forgotten the standards set by the coach.
The last move was too weak and they've only defeated home defense once, so the Rangers have to move fast if they want to get them off the board.
Erdogan is receiving a negative reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was planned to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed a number of issues, including the lack of human rights and press freedom and Turkey's access to the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkey outside Turkey.
Due to the security measures imposed by the police, 25,000 people were blocked from gathering in front of the mosque, but several followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters (mostly Kurds) joined their voices to protest Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the president.
Protesters from both sides expressed disagreements over the president's actions, with some Turks in Germany calling him a hero and others saying he was just an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: a cyclist died in a car crash
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m. This road in Deptford, southeast of the city, is often overcrowded.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived shortly after, but the man died on the spot.
On Childers Street, a mile after Saturday's accident, another cyclist died a month ago and the driver escaped.
Metropolitan police are working to identify the man and alert his family.
Some roads have been closed and the usual route of bus lines has been changed; motorists are also advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a dispute
Six prison officials were wounded in a clash in a maximum-security prison, the prison office said.
The dispute broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 am (BST) on Sunday morning and the riots have not yet ended.
Tornado officers have arrived at the prison to resolve a dispute that began with eight detainees, who have so far been confined to a wing of the building.
Officers had minor injuries to their faces and were treated there.
A representative from the prison service said that we have sent in experienced prison staff to stop the riots at HMP Long Lartin.
We've cured six workers from their injuries.
We will not tolerate any kind of violence in our prisons, and we will hand over those who started the riot to the police and they will probably spend much more time in the bars of the prison.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including the most violent criminals in the country.
In June, the prison warden was hospitalized for assault by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-riot officials had to go to prison to stop a serious dispute, because the detainees were attacking the workers with pool sticks.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat with flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the driest areas may benefit some)
It's very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but it's going to happen next week as Hurricane Rosa wears off its strength, visiting the desert of the southwest and threatening flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding that could occur on Monday and Friday; the hurricane will move westward through Arizona and south and east through Nevada; as well as through California and southeastern Utah; including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will be heading straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rain on Monday will signal her arrival.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, ten tropical cyclones that have formed 200 miles from Phoenix have maintained their status as tropical storm or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border".
According to the latest forecasts from the National Hurricane Center, two to four inches of water will accumulate, and the Mogollon, Arizona, coastline will accumulate a maximum of six inches.
As for other areas of the southwestern desert (including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin), 1-2 inches of water will accumulate; in isolated places 4 inches will accumulate at most.
For those who expect sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing because of the drought that the land has suffered.
Floods should not be underestimated, but these rains could be beneficial to the drought that the southwest is suffering.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa will remain strong on Sunday morning and will produce maximum winds of 85 mph, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, at that time, with a speed of 12 mph.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific and as a result, its potential is weakening.
So, it's going to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or night as a tropical storm.
With severe storms in parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "rainfall will leave 3 to 6 inches of water from Baja California to southwestern Sonora, and may cover 10 inches in some places".
Rosa will then pass through northern Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression; then it will pass through Arizona and head south to Utah on Tuesday night.
"The major threats from the Rose or its storms are severe storms that will form in the Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern desert regions of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains will create sudden flooding and dangerous debris waves in the deserts and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenager was shot and wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday morning at 4:00 AM (BST).
She was taken to the hospital and her condition is stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested that night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
If anyone has a recording or a trace of what happened to their phone, the police have called for their help.
Trump says Kavanaugh must endure the unjustified wrath of the Democratic Party.
"The votes cast for Judge Kavanaugh reject the ruthless and angry tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh must endure the absurdity and anger of the Democratic Party in his nomination process.
On Tuesday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, completely denying the allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford, who, according to the woman, was raped by Kavanaugh decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified after hearing his case.
The president said this Saturday, "The people of the United States saw that day the courage, intelligence and quality of Kavanaugh".
"The votes to elect Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best legal mind of our time, and that this jurist has devoted his entire life to protecting public service", the President told his West Virginia supporters.
Not only did the president talk about Kavanaugh's nomination, but he also talked about the role the Republican Party plays in these elections.
"We have five weeks to vote in the most important election of our lives.
I'm not going to participate, but I'm going to campaign".
"That's why I'm here, to fight for the best candidates.
Trump also said the Democratic Party is using strategies to obstruct and complicate the campaign.
According to a senior Republican official with CNN, the voting process for Kavanaugh's nomination will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami; the death toll is rising
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi; most died while huge waves were destroying the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in the city of Palu, but at dusk six-meter (18-foot) waves broke through the coast; several people were dragged to their deaths and everything on the way was destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The tsunami threat alert was issued yesterday, but people were still on the beach doing some activities and did not immediately escape; that's why they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB) in an interview in Jakarta.
"The tsunami swept away cars, logs and houses and destroyed everything on the land", says Nugroho; in particular, the tsunami has travelled through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before reaching the coast.
"Several people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", the representative said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palo Alto.
Several buildings and shops were destroyed, a bridge was torn down and a mosque surrounded by water can be seen in aerial photos taken by the disaster response agency.
The earthquake's replicas continued to shake the coastline on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
According to a report published by the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT), the energy level released by the major earthquakes on Friday was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located in a long narrow bay, may be related to the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
According to Nugroho, the disaster was devastating, with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels destroyed.
Several bodies of victims have been found among the ruins of the destroyed buildings, resulting in an additional 540 injured and 29 people missing.
Nugroho also said the number of casualties and disaster could increase along the 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline of Palou, particularly a place called Donggala, which is near the epicenter.
The media in Donggala are not functioning and we have no information, Nugroho said.
According to the Red Cross, there are over 300,000 people in the area, and so far, the organization's staff and volunteers are moving to locations set up by the organization to provide assistance.
"It's a tragedy already, but it could be much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency received harsh criticism for not providing information about the tsunami that devastated Palu, but according to officials, the waves appeared after the warning was transmitted.
In a video shared on social media, you can see a man in a building, screaming, "A tsunami is coming" to warn people on the street.
A few minutes later, the water wall reaches the coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
Since the earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread power outages, all media in Palou have been cut off, making it difficult for the competent authorities to organize rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the military has sent aid from Jakarta and other cities in cargo planes, but the evacuees still need food and priority goods.
The city's airport has reopened to facilitate relief efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation center in Palou on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia left more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
The staff of the Donggala-based World Vision organization have arrived in Palu city without any problems (the workers there have built shelters in the yard of the organization's office), but they have seen firsthand the terrible situation left by the disaster, said Doseba.
"I was told that a lot of houses were destroyed", he said.
That's really bad.
Although relief teams began to work on the sad fixing of disaster work, some experienced workers and assistants complained about the advice given not to go to Palura.
Under Indonesian law, international financing, supply and labor supply zones can only be started after being classified as national disaster zones.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-wide disaster", says Aulia Arrianiki, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, it's a national disaster,' we'll be able to open the doors to international assistance, but it hasn't been classified as such yet".
In the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing still did not lose hope that the unlikely miracle of finding their loved ones would happen.
On Saturday, a little baby was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers recovered a woman trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, coached two of the paragliding players who were missing from the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
"As an expert in the world of parachuting, I have my emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the parapentist community, he was sending WhatsApp messages to competitors who were at the beach party.
His messages, however, only got one grey arrow, no two blue marks.
"I think that means those messages weren't sent", he added.
Thieves stole $26,750 while they were filling up the Newport on the Levine ATMs.
Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Newport on the Brink ATM employee, according to the Newport Police Department.
The driver was clearing the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the notice.
While he was working, another man "attacked the Brink worker from behind and stole a bag of money he was supposed to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the notice, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the unexpected.
If you have any information about their identity, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The creature known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the term "Ye" for some time, and has used that term as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
He made the change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, where he expected Yandhi to present his latest album.
She took part in the show in place of Ariana Grand, who, according to the show's creator, could not participate due to emotional reasons.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has indicated that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible (in English) and it means zu in the Bible", West recently stated, speaking to the radio host Big Boy about the album.
"So I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, who means "one thing, to become Ye" - a reflection of our good, bad, confused and everything.
This work is a better reflection of who we are".
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
We've also known Sean Combs as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has indicated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Even Jay-Z, a former West collaborator, has changed the little line and the big letters.
AMLO Mexico has pledged not to use the military against its citizens.
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed not to use armed force or army against his citizens when the country will live through the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed of repression against students.
Lopez Obrador, on Saturday, swore on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people, to halt the rise of leftist students who were taking power across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexicans get their education by providing monthly grants and opening more free public colleges.
He says unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double AA funding.
As China becomes more active in AI, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments were made when various parties in the U.S. government made several announcements about AA, although the U.S. generally has no official strategy for AA.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to become the best in AA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the investigation of AA would be a good start, as the rest of the country is far from the United States and AA is looking for the next discovery", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of major discoveries of AA in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is being published this month, is Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has conducted research on one of China's leading AA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AA system that surpassed America's top-notch Othello player and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in China.
Lee praised the pre-government technology competitions of the United States, including the Advanced Defense Projects Research Agency's Robotic Competition, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next dreamer.
Researchers in the United States must work hard to get government funding, Lee says.
"It doesn't mean China has academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee added.
Facebook, Google and a number of other tech companies have hired the smartest college students to be on AA in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy would also help the United States promote AA practices.
"I think the AA doctors should be automatically given green cards", he said.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund people in academic institutions just as they do in the United States, but in China the quality of academic work is lower, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence where partners from industry and education gathered, and the White House announced that it had formed a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI NEXT.
As with NSF, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AA research.
Meanwhile, EU legislation aimed at creating a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has made no progress in recent months.
The Macedonians had a referendum to decide whether or not to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian country voted by referendum on Sunday to decide whether or not to change the name of the former Republic of Macedonia, which would end decades of conflict since Greece blocked its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which once had a province called Macedonia, still claims that the name of its northern neighbors occupies its territory, blocking its accession to NATO and the UN.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say that the change is detrimental to the ethnic identity of most Macedonian Slavic citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum and boycotted the campaign which raised doubts about whether the referendum would achieve the 50 percent required to be valid.
The question on the referendum paper is, "Are you for NATO and the EU membership and for the Greek consensus?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it deserves to be included in the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the dissolution of Yugoslavia.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young Macedonians, to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because that will bring us a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, the parliamentary majority has indicated that they will follow the vote to decide.
It will take three-thirds of the parliament to change its name.
The state Election Commission said it had not reported any unexpected events until 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent voted, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of those eligible to vote voted.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevsky, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko, voted in the Macedonian referendum in favour of the country's name change and possibility of joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumican, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small stage and stairs were preparing to boycott the referendum in front of the tents.
"We stand with NATO and the EU, but we want to meet our own terms and conditions and not through the server door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can look to China or Russia and we can be part of the Euro-Asian unification".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership can bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said saying "yes" would "strengthen our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Organization for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - less than necessary.
Another poll by Macedonian TV's Telma TV said 57 percent of residents thought they would vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
To have a successful referendum, you have to get 50 percent plus a vote in favor.
If the referendum were to fail, it would be the first major failure in Western pro-Western policy since it began in May last year.
Look, Manchester City player Sergio Aguero has passed all of Brighton's defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame all of Brighton's defence in a 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was easy for Aguero to score the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper was given a pass in the middle of the field early in the game.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders before he hit the open field.
Auguro suddenly found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed one of his defenders after fleeing several others on the edge of the Brighton sand.
Then he turned left and there was Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero in the sand at the first touch, and he used his right foot to pass Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a throw to the right of the net.
"He's overcoming a lot of problems every day on his feet", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And it was.
We were so happy he scored that goal".
But Sterling gave the blue shirts a head start in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguro picked up the ball in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy San a great pass from the left.
San made a few touches to the remote pole before he turned Sterling.
The blue jersey guy pushed the ball into the net before he got off the line.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the Champions League match on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena football stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end for the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the competition, there was little reason to force them to start again.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer wants to take the lead on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but the Rockies still suffer the effects of a tie, which still gives the Los Angeles Dodgers a one-game lead in the NL West.
The Rockie's have at least a commodity by beating the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but they'll still have to try to win their first division title.
"Even if we play for nothing, at least we know that the atmosphere in Denver will be crowded, and that the opposing team will play at the best level in all the areas we will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter, but it looks like they'll let Scherzer launch.
Scherzer, who is about to make his 34th start, had a shot on Thursday and it looks like he's going to be a pitcher on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's statements in West Virginia
The President reviewed the situation and cited the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his elected to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republican involvement in midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the great -- I'm not a candidate, but I am, and that's why I'm everywhere that great candidates are running".
Trump added, "You can see the tremendous group of extremist Democrats, you can see what's happening right now.
And they have no doubt about using whatever resources are necessary to remove power, greed, and inequality.
They don't care who they hurt, who they pass on to get control and power, we don't give them that".
The Democrats, he said, are meant to "eat and hinder".
"As you have seen in the last four days", he said, "the Democrats are angry and prudent and they are disgusting and false.
She signed up for Democratic Party Senator Dianne Feinstein, of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received the screams of the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for someone -- that's wrong body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour will not have much access.
He's intolerant of what they think.
When the activists at my local Momentum party voted against me, it wasn't a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last member of the Labour MPs list of people who weren't welcome -- to say what we all thought.
My member of parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way for speaking out for anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As a responsible economic politician, national security, in Europe, Jeremy disagreed with his predecessors on similar issues.
The news about the Eastern Nottingham meeting on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years I've been a local Labour MP, that's what the GC meetings on Friday night have been about.
Unfortunately, today, the promise of a polite, respectful policy has never been mentioned, if ever.
It's becoming clear that there are different views within the Labour Party and opinions are being judged whether or not they are acceptable to the party leaders.
It started when Jeremy became a leader, when members of our group who had previously shared political views began to turn around 180 degrees and demand that we accept views that I would never accept -- both on national security and the single market in the EU.
Every time I spoke publicly -- no matter what I said -- a bunch of comments on social media that denounced the central politics and demanded that I be removed from it, harassment, happened, from people who said I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the opinions that are thrown against me are often political.
Every day I depend on friends who have to deal with the persecution of sexism or racism with professionalism and honesty, but never shame.
One of the unpleasant aspects of the politics of this time is that the current level of persecution is considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn, last week, said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we don't get a single opinion on every motion of no confidence or when party rules get tighter.
Over the last couple of years I've received a lot of messages telling me to lower my head, not talk so much, and that I would be OK.
But that's not what I'm into politics.
32 years ago, as a student, driven by the indifference of Thatcher's government, I left the classroom and entered the most needed public service - as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will ever doubt my political views and my disagreements with current leaders.
I would say to those who have promoted the motion on Friday that as the country moves towards Brexit it will harm our homes, businesses and public services that I do not understand how to waste time and energy discussing my loyalty to Labour Party leaders.
But my real message is not to support Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether I am a member of the Labour Party or not: I am very proud to work for you and I promise you that I will not be deterred from continuing to work for what is best for your interests by threats or political documents.
Chris Leslie is MP for East Nottingham.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr is the leader who has not lost a game yet
The last two unexpected attempts somehow altered the final result, but without a doubt Ayr deserved the victory in the day-to-day match of the wonderful and fun Tennent Championship.
They're in first place on the board, and they're the only team that hasn't lost a single game out of ten.
At the end of the day, they had a better defense, they took advantage of the opportunities, and the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be happy.
"We have been tested so far and have not lost a single one. So we should be happy", he said.
Robyn Christi of Melros added, "My honours to Ayr, who used the opportunities better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th minute practice, conducted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card taken from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, left by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrosi to add points and Jason Baggot failed to make the attempt.
Climo stopped Ayr's leader by penalty, before, at the end of the first half, he had a solo rehearsal and Ayr went 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got off to a great start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's practice, carried out by Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of player Ruaridh Knott, who was pulled out of the hand-bed and, upon his return to the game, Ayr reached further afield when he turned Stafford McDowall's practice into a Climato.
Then Blair Macpherson was given the yellow card from Ayr and once again, Melros benefited from being a more man, with Bruce Colvin's failed rehearsal, a vivid ending.
The home crowd came back and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for not stopping Climo from the penalty line, MacPherson was moving forward and touching the ground behind the Ayr team's pole.
Cleo scored, as he did almost from the start, Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's ass and kicked Gregor Henry's wing out in the fifth home practice.
The Still Game star is about to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry.
It seems that the actor Ford Kieran is about to jump into the hospitality world after learning that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose writer and star he is, alongside longtime cast member Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the show would be the final episode of the ninth season, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress declined to comment on the story, although sources in the Scottish Sun magazine said Kiernan wanted to be included in a major Glasgow restaurant brand.
'The sea is ours': Inland Bolivia expects the courts to reopen the way to the Pacific
Marine patrol, shipping equipment headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have blue flags.
On the shipyards from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the following slogan reads: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to recover it".
Across Inner Bolivia, the bloody 19th-century Chilean coastal conflicts still persist - as they continue to crave to sail the Pacific once again.
These expectations are perhaps stronger now than in recent decades, because Bolivia expects that on October 1st, after five years of deliberation, the international courts will resolve.
"Bolivia is living in the right moment with a sense of harmony and calmness, and of course, it is looking forward to the outcome", says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the international court's decision through huge screens distributed across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will justify Bolivia's demands - after decades of negotiations - as Chile has been forced to negotiate the granting of a subsea route to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charming indigenous president of Bolivia - who is heavily involved in the race for re-election next year - has also made several contributions to Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he said late last August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia and, as a result, that much will not change.
The United Nations, headquartered in the Netherlands, has no authority to cede territory to Chile and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of the negotiations that may be underway.
The fact that the International Court's decision came six months after the negotiations ended indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's cause, they've been backward in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken captive by the current Bolivian administration", Zarat said.
He says President Morales' belligerent rhetoric has thwarted all the efforts left in Chile to do good.
Bolivia and Chile still have a lot of issues to play, but it's going to be very difficult to continue to discuss after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with those who say the court's ruling is particularly smart.
On Monday, Bolivia said it would "have a great opportunity to restore relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreement for the good of both".
Calzadilla expressed disagreement with those who claimed that Morales - still one of South America's popular presidents - used the sea problem to gain political support.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This decision is an opportunity we should have seen to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until the United States has the confidence to do so.
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country is not disarmed until Washington can trust it.
Rick testified before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States, at the summit in Singapore, before the leaders of the enemy, to keep its promise.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this after considering that Singapore has been on the verge of re-blocking nuclear diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for more than three months.
Rik says it's "utopia" to think that continued sanctions and the declaration of the end of the Korean War will put North Korea at its feet by U.S. objections.
Washington is reluctant to accept the confession before Pyongyang makes any move to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a great deal of skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about the country's apparent security, the only way to guarantee it's surrender of all arms.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to host the second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion show, on the High Street next door, she's showing off the latest line of mass-produced hats.
If you want to expand your hat collection or block the sun completely, here's the answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of large-size jewelry hats in their spring-summer 2019 collection, which shook the style of the Paris Fashion Week show.
This summer, some of the most impractical hats have come to Instagram and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the aisle.
Valentino's most notable pieces, with a beix-colored hat feathered wing, covered the heads of the models.
And among the other large accessories, we have a kind of jewelry-filled angular, a bit of a weird hat, and even a kind of pine - but they're not heated designs.
Thom Brown also showed off his collection of jewelry masks just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have lipsticks and look more like Hannibal Lecter's than the top-notch sewing masks.
One looked like a scuba mask with glasses and pipes, and the other was a little ice cream puddle.
If you're a fashion fan, you have good news.
The stylists say the hats will be out on the street, even to those around you.
The big hats come after La Bomba', a two-foot wide-winged straw hat, worn by a wide variety of celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly unpractical hat that has been successful on social media has taken another object to the aisle - a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the model of the swimsuit she wears.
The orange bag of raffia, cut from raffia cloth and with a white leather handle, has been finished as the protagonist of Jacquemuse's La Riviera 2019 Spring-Half collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope that big hats and big beach bags will hit the main streets next summer, with the huge resonance that the designer has had it would be hard to ignore the demand for giant accessories".
John Edward: Basic language skills for global citizenship
Independent schools in Scotland have achieved academic excellence records, and followed that up in 2018 with outstanding results in surveys, which were reinforced by outstanding results in individual and group sports, art, music and other community projects.
With 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, strive to provide the best service to students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for higher education, for their chosen career and as citizens.
As an education sector, we can design and implement personalized school curricula, and we've seen that modern languages remain the standard choice of choice for students.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you'll get to their mind.
But if you speak to him in his language, you will reach his heart".
It's a powerful way to remind us that to build relationships and gain trust with people from other countries, we don't have to use only English.
And we can see from the latest surveys this year that languages are the top-rated in independent schools.
68 percent of students who study foreign languages have the highest A rating.
Data collected from 74 SCIS elementary schools shows that 72 percent of students achieved the highest A-rating in Mandarin Chinese; 72 percent in German; 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign languages as an indispensable skill that young people and children will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now being worked on as a core subject (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and others.
A survey by the EU Commission in 2014 found that one of the main reasons for job vacancies was language ignorance.
More and more, language learning is becoming essential to prepare young people for future careers.
With the increased job opportunities that languages require, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career they choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with that lifelong advantage.
Being able to talk directly to people from other countries will automatically put the elected person at the top of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the EU, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language as a normal conversation, and among those who spoke only French, this rose to a two-digit figure of 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in teaching languages to kids today.
Speaking more than one language, which is mostly used in economic development, will give your children more opportunities to find better jobs.
In Scotland, schools are distinguished by the language they teach.
Some students prefer more classical modern languages, while others prefer more modern languages that seem to be relevant to EBA by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a wide language choice for independent schooling, with teachers who are experts in the field.
The aim of independent schools in Scotland is to train and equip children in different areas to succeed in the future.
We can't deny this time, in an international business environment where languages are essential for the future of our country, so we need to reflect that in education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer their choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his debut with the Lakers on Monday in San Diego.
LeBron James, the top-rated star, is about to make his Los Angeles debut.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Monday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't said how many minutes he's playing yet.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton wrote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play for a limited time.
After this week's training, James was asked about the Lakers' pre-season schedule for six games.
"I don't need a preseason game to train at this stage of my career", he replied.
Trump's West Virginia Rally, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will kick off the campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's five rallies next week, and he will visit several places he has friends, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While awaiting a vote that would give him a re-election to the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the midterm elections, where Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia today, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's tour of West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia via YouTube.
It looks like Trump will preside over this week's Supreme Court nomination hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, until Senate confirmation that you're in a position to uphold your vote for sexual misconduct while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
But the main purpose of this rally tour is to help the Republicans win some votes in the November election.
So President Trump's campaign says the goal of these five rallies next week is to revive the volunteers and help the Republicans hold their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The congressional objection is of paramount importance and the president will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign session", said Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not give permission to Reuters to register.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's rally will allow fans in Ohio and Pennsylvania and media in Pittsburgh to cover the event, according to West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey of Virginia, who is stalking him.
It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to go there to help with the election", says Simon Header, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA will try to continue Sunday's individual competition
After three one-on-one sessions, the Saturday afternoon four seemed to have what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key to this moment is a completely invented concept of sport, in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you tell me now is the time?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I think it's time, somehow", said Jordan Spieth, when he was doing the one-day zone.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points out of the 12 in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is not going their way, and they need help, especially from Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three out of four points.
Spieth has been very decisive, from the equals to the greens, and he's running with the model.
Those shouts of celebration have been made louder as the turns have progressed, and it has resulted in a significant putt, winning four all-square, after Thomas lost two after two.
He celebrated with another scream similar to the whore he won in Game 15, which indicates that the American team is not out of the competition.
"You have to find strength and focus on your game", Spieth said.
It's what's left of those players.
18 holes to get out of the side.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the historic Ryder Cup players.
Four out of four special but charming European couples are sure to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to shoot a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they stopped the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday the last nine.
That turn and the crowd and the energy that came from it made them a couple to beat on Sunday and there was no more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molina to close Europe's victory when the sun rises at Le Golf National.
I'd rather have them both in separate holes together.
Still, it's too early to talk about the great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated the work of Sergio Garcia, the best of the four, when he was tied with Alex Noren.
They put a bogey and two doubles ahead of the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that was never too close to be defeated.
But on Sunday, there was no one to help you out of your hole.
The four were fascinated by the close-up interaction between the couples, the advice they gave and the advice they didn't give, and how the strategy could change in a moment.
Europe performed better as a team, and had a significant lead in the final, but the quarter-final showed that the American team had the courage to fight, even if some, particularly Stateside, questioned it.
Europe has a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe has taken a significant lead in the Ryder Cup final after Saturday's four-way tie for 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinaari, the pair won two victories against Tiger Woods, who struggled hard, and scored their four precious points so far in Le Golf National.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn, trying to win back the prize Hazelin lost two years ago, took the lead this morning, winning the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance, and won two games, but they couldn't beat the odds.
They needed eight points from Jim Fury to hold on to the prize in 12 games each Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to score four straight points and, along with Molinarí, who after a great weekend called "Molliwood", are the second in Ryder Cup history to win four points in four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourball, he played his best game. The tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau beat him by five to four.
Woods, after playing two games on Saturday, showed some touch of excellence, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome, seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning fourball and returned with Henrik Stenson to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2&1 in the quarterfinals - the best and third in the world.
Europe never found its way to a nice, cool southwest day in Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas set the American benchmark, two points, on Saturday.
They scored a blurry 2-1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy too after losing the first two holes in the 4&3 quarter.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to overcome a four-point gap and enter the individual standings, although the Fury side needed only a draw to hold the prize.
After being the second best in two days, after Sunday's upset, they'll be ahead of him.
North Korea has given a negative round to the disarmament without any confidence.
The North Korean foreign minister on Saturday informed the United Nations that sanctions continue to undermine confidence in the United States and that under such circumstances they will not, under any circumstances, stop building nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken meaningful measures of goodwill last year, including halting nuclear weapons and missile tests, leaving nuclear testing sites and pledging to stop developing nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we don't see a proper response from the United States", he said.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and, in no way, we can leave our first weapons alone".
Rik repeats the North Korean family's complaint about Washington's resistance as part of a phased process of denuclearization where North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps to stop the nuclear disarmament in Pyongyang.
Rik Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump refer to the first summit of the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, and Trump swore to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang should first lay down its arms.
Washington has ignored international voices calling for a relaxation of sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States reiterates its first-ever withdrawal and the level of pressure on sanctions continues to increase to force them to achieve their goal, and it is against the declaration of the end of the war", Rik said.
"To think that the Zygor will put us at their feet is the utopia of those who do not know us.
The problem is that continued punishment is increasing distrust".
Rick didn't mention the second summit between Kim and Trump announced earlier this week at the United Nations by the US leader.
The minister, meanwhile, has mentioned three meetings in the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the other side were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be blocked".
However, the tone of Ri's speech would be completely different from last year's, when he stated at the UN General Assembly that North Korea was necessarily aiming its missiles at the United States, since President Trump called him "Mr. Kimi" during his suicide mission.
This year, before the United Nations, Trump, who said he would destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but he said that it still needed to be done and that sanctions would continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have the time, whether it's two years, three years, or five months -- it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be enforced, without fail, until we can verify that its denuclearization is genuine".
The Security Council has unanimously promoted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 as a bid to block the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the National Bank's General Meeting and later announced that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, he said that something unique had been achieved for North Korea after hours of claiming that it was making demands like the Gangsters".
North Korea has vowed to leave missile sites and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.
He told Kimi he was looking for "measures that apply to them" that were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore and talked about moving toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken a course on how to get enough rest.
This year's Harvard class will allow graduates to sleep more, trying to cope with the ever-expanding culture of people who study by drinking coffee for a night out.
A professor observed that in the best universities in the world, students lose their prizes as the basic way to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the UK.
She began the course when she gave a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation during her studies.
"A girl came up to me in the back of my mind and said, 'Why should I do that now, in my last year of school?'
He said that no one had ever told him how important it was to sleep well, and that surprised me, the Telegraph said.
The course, which was first offered this year, explains to students the impact of proper sleep habits on their academic and sporting outcomes, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry and director of health services at Harvard Medical School, said the university decided to launch the course when they saw students sleeping less during the week.
The long-term course includes several interactive sections.
In one section, there's a picture of a bedroom where students tap on coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books to see the effect of caffeine and light, and to see the effect of sleep deprivation on sports performance, and to realize the importance of sleep habits.
In another section, participants were taught that getting too little sleep could increase their risk of heart attacks, depression, or cancer.
On a campus map, using interactive icons, participants are invited to reflect on their daily habits.
'We know we won't change students' habits suddenly.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the consequences for your health if you choose to smoke", Czeisler added.
There is still a culture of pride in doing "go-go", he says, and the increasing pressure on modern technology and students is exacerbating the problem of doing little.
Sleeping well, with good quality sleep, should be the secret weapon to coping with stress, fatigue and nervousness, he said -- and also to gain weight, because sleeping poorly makes the brain hungry, and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and he had one of his first classes in his first year at Harvard.
He stated that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to attend a course that was part of the campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask graduates to do a similar research before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm to determine when to go to bed and even wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Meng has defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers have suffered another defeat in Dolly Meng's strike that scored 1-0 to Steven Gerrard in Livingston.
They wanted Ibrox to win for the first time since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holte's side caused the Gerrard team's second defeat in their 18th game as coach, with his eight points leaving the Landbrokes Championship leaders' Hearts unchecked.
Meng's strike was over seven minutes before the strike break, and Rangers' work failed to draw.
The Rangers are now down to sixth, while Livingston is up to third, and they're only behind Hibernian for the goal.
The problem could have been more serious for the Rangers, who had to treat Calum Spence's wing for a head injury, which they say was hit by an object thrown from the outside.
Gerrard made eight substitutions and made the semi-finals of the Ayr Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with him to Livi 11, who took a point off Heartsey last week and would be happy to see his well-fitting outfit strangle his opponents every turn.
The Rangers took over the property, but Livingston benefited more from their play.
Menga's Scott Pittman wingman should have scored the goal thrown by Allan McGregor but the midfielder did not take the opportunity.
A deep free throw by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to push him away to the back pole.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third of their game, it seemed like hope was greater than belief.
Alfredo Morelos thought there should be a penalty at the quarter-finals when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson declined to consider the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to make only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had hardly any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's light hit.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have hurt the game, but no one can deny that they were worth the effort.
Once again, the Rangers failed to match Jacobs's ball-stop play.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Gerrard intervened during the break replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change was immediately effective when the wingman passed to Morelos, but the formidable Kelly ran over his line to block.
But Livingston kept forcing the outsiders to play their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to extend their lead, but McGregor held him firmly before he was hit by the head injury from the Lithgow corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again called for a penalty at the end when he was stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now for our Sunday Morning German page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and before DENBORA... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity: from this invention came what is known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been the frontier of science, and has also become a frontier of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboys:
The man said, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms being radiated by mineral activity".
Evans: "Yes, it's coming right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect bad cells.
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to kill and kill bad cells.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the bad cells within the treatment.
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and then alter them in the lab.
And then they can see a protein that's common in many cancers and then they can inject it.
The trial vaccine is giving very good results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was given a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize bad cells, was able to get the ovarian cancer out of her system for more than 18 months.
This is the method: you take out immune cells from the patient and alter them in the lab so that you can "see" a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then you inject the cells again.
Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show we have a vaccine of great promise".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, colon and colon cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to how to get cancer cells from patients and how to get to cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a Trump-friendly diatribe wearing a MAG hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work.
Kanye West was shouted out in his studio on Saturday Night Live when he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, began to speak out against Democrats and reaffirmed his pro-Trump stance.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they say, 'Why do you like Trump, because he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", she said.
The series began with a sketch starring Matt Damon by SNL in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, West's offensive speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if he was trying to make Rock West laugh with the release.
Besides, West complained to the public that he had a bad time on his wings because of his hat.
"I was dragged between the wings.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat".
I've been attacked!
And then they say I'm in a place that's down", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the bottom of the sea?" "I'm gonna wear my Superman coat, which means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His words led to at least a couple of whistles from the audience and the members of the SNL show seemed embarrassed, as Variety reported, and one person at the meeting told the magazine, "The whole studio was completely silent".
West was brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Rac Miller, had been killed a few days earlier.
The Web surprised a lot of people with their rendition of "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who posted this tweet: "One of the bravest spirits: A CURRENT MAFIA OF ASKO FORMED".
But as the talk show's host Karen Hunter tweeted, West was simply "being who he is, and that's wonderful".
"But I do NOT wish to reward a person who adopts an ideology that is harmful to the community (by buying his music or clothes or protecting his culture)".
He's free.
And so are we".
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying that he had recently created a creature that until now was called Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, and not to mention the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and made him the artist Prince was up to that time.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is due to appear in Belfast's First Circuit Court on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has stood up against the toxic masculinity of the
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been opposed to the stereotype of a matxist hero, saying that the appearance of such roles on screen often makes young men feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In statements to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed 'something was wrong' and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during #MeToo.
Kit also recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old star of Game of Thrones, and admitted that she is "really convinced" that she has to deal with the problem.
'Personally, and with great confidence, I'm thinking right now -- what have we done wrong with masculinity?' she said.
'What have we been teaching men as they grow up, given the problem we are facing now?'
Kit believes that television can also be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, due to the fact that the characters are very masculine.
He continued, "What is inherent and what is taught?
What is it that you teach on TV, and on the streets, that makes young boys feel that they have to take on this form of manhood?
I think that's one of the most important issues of our time. How can we change that?
'Cause it's obvious something went wrong for young men.'
He also admitted in the interview that he will not be making a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said he's 'finished with battlefields and horses.'
Starting November, Kit will be appearing in Sam Shepard's return of True West, a film about a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
'I met my wife on this show, and so she gave me my future family and life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the woman who loves Kit's Jon Snow character, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health officials.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But in this way, the number of people infected with HIV dropped to almost zero, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry a woman.
Many of the transmission of diseases in relationships are due to the use of inappropriate sexual protective equipment.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied the GOP senators' data leaked to the workers, and has upset the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Time, Maxine Waters on Saturday alleged that a member of her team posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles have said the claims were made by "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
"More lies, more lies and more contemptible lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information was published with information from three U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Tuesday by an unknown person posted on Capitol Hill during a hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
The leak came shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source was linked to Waters' office and published information about a Waters staff member, Hill said.
"This groundless claim is completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
"My team members - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent false claims - are not responsible for any leakage of that information.
An unfounded claim is completely false and utterly false".
Waters's remarks were immediately criticized online, such as by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"That exclusion was made out of anger", wrote Fleischer.
"That shows that he is not qualified to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't have to show any defiance.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
"He must appear calm and gentle".
Fleischer seemed to want to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being overly angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, also a Republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"If the meaning is real", he tweeted.
In his statements, Waters said his office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities regarding these fraudulent statements.
"We ensure that those who have broken the law are identified", he continued, "and that they are held accountable to the law for any act that is harmful or dangerous to any member of my staff or staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of the low power spy Rowan Atkinson
It has now become traditional to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film with a British beam, and this does not seem to apply to the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise. It began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
By satirizing ourselves about what kind of garbage we are, will we get a new export option for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his big-eyed, rubber-faced face has renewed his license to screw things up for the second time: his name above all shows that he is just a vast comic creation designed for non-English-speaking countries.
Despite his particular desire to get the flattering glamour, he's a silly secret agent who looks a little like Clouseu, of course, even a glimpse of Mr Bean and a little bit of the boy who's supporting Chariots of Fire with a single note at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
It's also based on the mysterious traveler and international man Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
There's a moment or two of greatness in J.E.'s last trip.
I loved the way Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the rotor crosses hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is visible on screen, but his humor lacks strength and is superfluous, especially when even serious filmmakers like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy among their components.
The humor seems more to be directed at children than it is to adults, and to me, the senseless adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and bright as the jokes of Bean in Atkinson's silent film.
The current topical premise is that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top secret British spy web, revealing the identities of every British agent on the job, and he is upset about the agent on duty.
That's too much for a prime minister with a pompous, haunted character who is already losing his political reputation completely: Emma Thompson gives her best with a character that almost resembles Teresa May, but the script doesn't help much.
His intelligence advisers tell him that since all of his active spies are in danger, he will have to recover someone who is retired.
And that means Johnny English is walking as he can, and he's now a teacher in a fancy place, but he's teaching a secret school about acting as a secret operative, and he's doing some pretty good jokes, because English has a "School of Rock" spy academy.
English is again taken to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, and is reunited with his former partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine gets lost in that rich boy-style role.
So, in His Highness' Secret Service, we have Batman and Robin back in action making things miserable, encountering the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova femme fatale of Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fascinated by a tech billionaire who claims he can fix the UK's computer misery.
English and Bough embark on their own farce adventures: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant, they create chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxurious yacht, and English ignites total anarchy when he tries to use virtual reality helmets to go inside and see what Volta's house looks like.
Every stop is focused on that last sequence, but as pleasant and messy as it is, it has a lot to do with children's TV.
It was a random thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I thought, "Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that deserves her talent?"
The Labour Party has denied that it is working on a plan for the British to work four days a week but pay five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is studying a radical plan that would allow British people to work a week of a friendly day but pay five days.
It seems the party wants the corporate bosses to give the workers what they saved through the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them one more vacation.
The workers would have three days' weekends, but they'd still take home the same salary.
Sources said the idea was "incorporated" into the party's economic agenda and that it wanted to turn the country to workers' side.
The move to four working days has been endorsed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to profit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is consistent with the party's vision of balancing the economy for the working class, and the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the party that supports such an idea, as the Green Party defended the four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not yet received the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party voter said: "Four days' work week is not the party's policy and the party does not consider it".
The shadowy minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party's congress last week to define his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said, without a doubt, that "faceless executives" and "speculators" should be removed from power in public service companies.
On the shadow minister's plane, the current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share, because a Labour government could make deductions if it finds that there has been wrong behaviour.
He also confirmed that there were plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to create the Property Inclusive Fund, which would give 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees, with annual dividends of up to £500 being cobbled.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy call "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds or not.
An FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings of the investigation could lead to a Republican senator losing his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could get anything out of their minds to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think of it, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said, 'When I went to the hearing, 'I said, 'I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, he came forward, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He answered with firmness, without hesitation".
Graham's vows, however, seem to be written on stone.
"I'm determined that Brett Kavanaugh will also be charged with causing an explosion", he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he mentions have not been able to verify that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changed".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event that brings together incredible artists and has a huge mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
With its 17th edition this time around, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to the Great Plains of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay a VIP ticket), those who want to attend the concert must perform a variety of tasks or "actions", such as sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise making a call that helps raise awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what kind of success has Global Citizen achieved with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is this the original idea of encouraging people to take action through a free concert, or is this just another example of what's called clicktivism, which is making people feel they're making a real change by signing an online request or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its followers, pressuring them to meet various goals.
He says that world leaders have pushed for more than $37 billion worth of policies and commitments to be announced, and these policies and commitments will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the groups cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or received.
The group estimates that the funds secured have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based association of investors and implementers committed to helping children reach their full potential. It has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizen like you, we will make the social injustice of undernutrition history", said The Power of Nutrition's ambassador Tracey Ullman in public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and babies in the UK, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition project, which will help 5 million women and children through nutrition-related interventions.
By answering this one of the FAQs on their website, what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like our previous great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be presenting at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the military as a "block" to slow down Russian energy exports.
If necessary, Washington could use its military to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has reported, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinc, Russia's relationship with Syria - which is notable because it operates under legitimate demand - is only an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think that's the reason they're in the Middle East, they want to negotiate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of Southern Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, with our military, has the ability to ensure that the sea lines are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants at an event organized by the Energy Alliance for Consumers, which is an event organized by a non-profit group that presents itself as the voice of energy for consumers in the United States.
Washington compared the approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, and concluded that they are essentially the same.
"Our economic option for Iran and Russia is to roughly exploit and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a single-source economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration was on a mission to promote its liquefied natural gas export to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which makes Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow, Trump says.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline's 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons, and the competition is an example of disloyalty.
"I think we're all in agreement that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's attitude has been negatively received by Germany, and it has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries, has urged the United States to refrain from interfering in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state blocks our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin after a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren will "examine deeply" her candidacy for president in 2020, said the senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, considering his candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider my candidacy".
Warren expressed his opinion on Donald Trump in the city hall, "asserting that he was leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said, "Obviously, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't believe he should run for president in 2020.
Forty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for president, according to a poll by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent of the voters voted in favor of the nomination.
The poll found that Deval Patrick's chances of running for governor were better, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent opposing.
Other names that have appeared in connection with a potential 2020 presentation include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder in Track Palin during Donald Trump's campaign.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the September invasion.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"For what my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, I feel identified with the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and with other families who are suffering the vulnerabilities that our soldiers bring when they return", she told a crowd at a pro-Donald Trump campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the arrest was "a significant matter", and he said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little changed, they come back hard, they come back with other soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military asking if there is that respect for their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault with domestic violence against a woman, including a statement that she was a victim of domestic violence and was intoxicated with a gun, according to Wasilla Police Voter Dan Bennett.
18 states, D.C. support the denial of the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting the legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts issued a statement of friendship on Friday to support a Washington asylum seeker, challenging police, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said that his partner "and members of his violent gang" had sexually abused him, but U.S. officials denied his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state's lawyers who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries that generate the largest number of asylum seekers in the United States because they have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy re-enacted a decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
In a statement Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine of Columbia said, "The new police force is ignoring years of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law provides that all asylum applications must be assigned based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a bar violates that principle", the statement from the amicus curiae brief said.
In addition, the lawyers argued in the letter that the policy of denial of entry to immigrants is damaging to the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become activists and provide the necessary labor force.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of being a member of a political group or opinion because of race, religion, nationality or social group", Sessions said when presenting the policy on June 11.
Asylum itself has never been a solution to all the problems that people in the world face every day, no matter how serious.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while the death toll has doubled, are in the race to find survivors.
For those who survived, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, a mother who was feverish as she calmed down her young son in the devastated city of Palu.
"The ambulance is bringing deaths every minute.
"There is no clean water".
They've seen people return to their destroyed homes, take their things from the water, try to save anything they find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals were overcrowded after 7.5 earthquakes.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, with broken back and shoulders, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to continuous replications.
Tears fell from his eyes as he told me how he felt the violent movement of the earthquake in his hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I crushed the remains of the wall", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his daughter.
I hope they're safe".
The US ambassador has accused China of using propaganda to attack
After an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an EU newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread his propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned the surcharge paid by the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register, the second-best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, last Wednesday after accusing China of trying to enter the US congressional elections on November 6. China denies the accusation.
Trump's accusation of Beijing trying to interfere in the US election has marked what US officials told Reuters that Washington's growing campaign was a new one to pressure China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to put up ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war in which each country has put spikes on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory thorns, which backed Trump's Republican Party at the beginning of the trade war, were intended to attack exports from states like Iowa, according to experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a state that is one of China's largest exporters of agricultural goods, has said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad reported in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "China is now intensifying the attack by placing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's strong tradition of free press and press freedom by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, here in the press kiosk right on the Beijing street, there are few dissenting voices and there is no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's conflicting economic course, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added, "One of China's most popular newspapers avoided an offer to publish his article, but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are driving women away from voting before the midterm elections with Kavanaugh's backing, analysts warn.
With many top Republicans waiting and defending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court against multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a decline, especially among women, in the next legislative midterm elections.
Emotions around this issue have been very high, and most Republicans are registered showing they want to move forward with the vote.
There's no turning back on those things", Grant Reeher, a professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts whether the pressure Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona could exert on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters shouting "November is coming!" protesting in front of the Senate that Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, he said in Mic.
"The Democratic Party's enthusiasm and motivation will be out of place", independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
"People say it's already had a big impact, and that's true.
But it could have even greater impact, especially among suburban women and young people who have no fixed voting rights, between the ages of 18 and 29, considering that they often don't vote even if they don't like the president".
Ford's nomination to the Supreme Court was a case that Ford had been exposing to the details of sexual assault before he even gave public testimony, but analysts suggested that there might be a decline if the Republicans decided to continue with the retaliation.
"It's become a big uproar for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not a matter of whether Kavanaugh should sit in the committee's ballot, the last vote or not, it's how the Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated the woman", Guy Cecil, the director of the team that helps elect the Democrat, told the news channel Priorities USA.
Anyway, it seems that Americans are pretty divided between the Ford and Kavanaugh witnesses when it comes to deciding who to believe, but it seems that a few more people are doing it for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony with certainty or probability, and 35 percent believed Kavanaugh's testimony with certainty or probability.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or probably lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, Ford's allegations are currently being investigated by the FBI, and at least by another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Ford assaulted Kavanaugh while he was drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that aims to take on Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid free software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the intention behind Inrupt being "to take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "database" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music storage, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify: they're all available in one browser, and all at once.
The distinctive feature of an online personal database is that it is entirely up to the user who can access a certain type of information.
The company calls it "empowering people through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to put the right resources, processes and skills in place to help make Solid available to all of us.
Right now, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, a few developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about the need for a radical change when their business models are changing radically from day to day.
"We're not asking them for permission".
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to install an ecosystem and commercial energy that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built by Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very, very optimistic about this next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman was honoured with the Victoria Cross of the First World War.
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross as a soldier of the First World War has been honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
The honorary Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was displayed by her two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone was awarded to his grandfather and displayed 100 years later.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint Quentin Canal while it was very close and under constant fire of cannons and machine guns.
Then he quickly went to the first line of fire, and with the greatest courage he led the line forward until he found a cannon and shot it down three floors of the target.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just months before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said he knew his grandfather's actions "would never have been able to do them himself, but that is humbling".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Vann said "it was a great honor for him to be part of the parade" and added "the support of many will prove the courage of a true hero".
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but they were replaced by Peppa Pig.
Let's say you're up all night watching Bellator 206 and then they don't let you watch the main show.
The San Jose poster had 13 fights, six of them on the main calendar, and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, they stunned the UK audience when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised to be up until the early hours of the morning willing to fight.
One follower described the change to children's cartoons on Twitter as a "bad-looking joke".
"A government law says that content was not appropriate for 6:00 a.m., and they had to switch to child programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the show.
"Pigs' pepper, yes".
Bellator's president Scott Coker said the programming would be reviewed for future consideration by UK audiences.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can probably fix it", Coker said.
"But it's Sunday morning at six o'clock, and we can't fix that until Sunday is our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on fixing it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and not all of them were very nice.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government matter.
I promise you, it won't happen again next time.
We're gonna have five fights instead of six, like we usually do, and we tried to give people more, and we screwed up.
It's a situation that unfortunately will happen".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's "Reduced" Sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling underestimated for sex, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone wasn't like him".
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne of Radio 4, she said she spoke to others to give them "hope" about gay rights.
He also said that being a parent made him less focused on winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of sick leave.
After being completely lost in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "deprived" of all the others because society didn't accept boys and girls being liked.
She said, "So far, the feelings that make you feel underrated and different from others have been the real reasons that have given me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that she was "something", because he didn't want people to be disappointed when they heard about her sexuality.
The Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile promoter of LGBTQ, and used her participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
She said she expressed her opinion because she felt she was lucky because she could live openly without consequences and because she wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 -- "hit her by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner who is 20 years older than her last year, but she said the age difference wasn't a problem between them.
He said, "When you're so young and you're going through so much", -- he went to the Olympics for the first time when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- it's hard to find someone of his age who's been through similar events.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "total vision" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the only thing I had in mind was, 'I need to win a gold medal,' " she said.
"And, you know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son is named after her father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't agree he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Games, because he wanted to be on the front lines.
"I couldn't tell her you're not going to be in the front row, Dad", she said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and I stopped breathing and I didn't accept that he wasn't invincible until he died", she said.
The next day Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to be in front of the local public at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", she said.
She also inspired her first song selection - Proud, Heather Small's - which made her feel identified throughout the entire Olympic preparation process and still gives her a chicken ass.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was in poor form, sat down on his chair Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
Phil Mickelson will set a record for the Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll have to improve his form so he doesn't look bad.
Mickelson was breaking his mark for two years by playing the event for the 12th time, but was sent to the chair by Captain Jim Fury in Saturday's fourball and foursome modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major champion split his day between being an animator and working on the field, hoping to direct what makes him suffer.
He was never the best driver, not even at the best of his career, and the 48-year-old is not the best choice for Le Golf National's competitive dynamic, where the toughest players take over the losers.
And even if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will have to face off against the British Open champion Francesco Molina in the ninth game on Sunday, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win four games this week.
If the Americans start 12 games under four points, and get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Fury showed confidence in his man, for he couldn't say much more.
"He understood the role he had for today, he slapped me in the back, and he said he'd be ready tomorrow", Fury said.
"She's very confident in herself.
He's a top athlete who has done a great job for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it happened, and we felt like we should have done it this way.
He wants to be there, like everyone else".
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record as the most-played player in the Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could be the end of a professional Ryder Cup career that never reached its individual mark again.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and stopped seven times, but according to Furyk, he's brought something untouchable to the team.
"She's funny, she's sarcastic, she's smart, she's always kidding people, and it's great to have her around", she said.
"The young players have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it was fun to watch.
He does more than just gamble".
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that their great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorne, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even though the last day's individual round is a big advantage, the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable situation.
In 1997, he made his debut for the Danish national team at Valderraman, where under Seve Ballesteros, his team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but narrowly won the tournament with a score of 141⁄2 and 131⁄2 respectively.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a big advantage at Valderraman and we scarcely won, and that we lost in Brooklyn and we had a big advantage", said Bjorne (pictured), after the class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, taking a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history tells me and all the other guys in the team that this isn't over yet.
We'll be working full time tomorrow.
We're gonna go out on the field and try to make it right.
Nothing's decided until the points are on the board.
We're aiming to win the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
As I always said, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the opposite side: some of the best players in the world".
Pleased with the achievements of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorne also said, "I never want to make any progress.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.
It's a one-man show tomorrow, and that's another thing.
It's great to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, every golfer needs to prove his or her full potential.
That's the message you're gonna give the players, get the best you can tomorrow.
Now, forget about your friends, who have to do their best".
Unlike Bjorne, Jim Fury of the other team believes his players will perform better as a member, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of four points.
Fury himself has been on both sides of these last-day shifts as part of the Brooklyn team that won, and later lost to the European team when the Europeans performed what is called the "Middle Ages Miracle".
"I remember every word he said", he said, "when we asked him how he encouraged the players of the 1999 captain Ben Crenshawk on his last day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to keep the lead from the start, just like in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the other side has an advantage, there's a lot of pressure in those mid-matches.
We've decided on that list of players, and we think we'll do a great job tomorrow".
Thomas has a counterattack assignment, and Rory McIlroy will be the opponent in the final match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other Europeans from the top-middle order.
"I chose this team in that order because they are capable of going all the way", Bjorne said of the individuals chosen.
The construction of the new German warship has been delayed again.
A new frigate of the German Navy was ordered in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but will not be built until at least the following year, due to the faulty systems and rising costs, according to local media.
The order for the battleship "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was ordered to the Navy in 2014, but eleven post-delivery issues have prevented her from completing this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It appears to have powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and naval missile characteristics and technology for carrying out covert actions (e.g., reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures).
It will also have a longer service life: the newest frigates can be out of the original ports for up to two years.
However, due to the continuous delays, warships with cutting-edge technology (which aim to project Germany's own capabilities) will remain outdated by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The badly completed F125 frigate made a lot of noise in the media last year, when the German army officially rejected the request for the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time a Marine had returned a ship to the yard after it was delivered.
The reasons for the translation are unknown, but German media reported "serious software and hardware failures that resulted in the warship being deemed unusable for use in combat missions".
The Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by 120 sailors, which is half of the Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the vessel is overweight, which results in a significant reduction in performance, making it more difficult for the navy to add novelty in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the German class used during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also a problem.
It's reported to have reached €3.1 billion, from €2.200 that it should have cost them initially.
The problems with the new frigates are even more important in the face of warnings that the German Navy's capacity is declining.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy's usable vessels are running out.
The deputy said the problem has become more and more serious because no replacement has been given since the old vessels were retired.
He lamented that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate had been commissioned into the navy.
The National Trust has investigated the secret life of bats.
A new study has been conducted on a plot of land in the Scottish Highlands to find out how bats use the landscape to find food.
They hope that more information will be gained about the behavior of these special flying mammals, so that we can better define future protective activities for them.
The research, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), will follow the common dwarf bats and sopranos, as well as the largemouthed and Daubenton bats, in the Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations, and the activities of bats will be monitored throughout the season.
UK health system (NHS) staff will also be conducting mobile drilling with manual detectors.
When experts analyze all the sound recorders, they will know the frequency of bats' calls, and what each species does.
Then, a map and report of the habitat will be made, providing a detailed landscape-scale picture of bats' behavior.
According to NTS conservation advisor Rob Dewar, the most important areas of bat habitat will be determined, as well as how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of work to treat habitat, such as the generation of grass, and how best to maintain forests for bats and related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects their nests and loses habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning are also dangerous, as are fly-catching paperwork, chemical treatments on building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, since they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles in the airway.
NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of Scotland, and takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct inspections, nest tests and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Dumfries and Galloway estate of Threave, where eight of the ten Scottish bat species live.
The land manager, David Thompson, says the land is the perfect land for them.
"We have a great area for Threaven bat", he said.
"We have old buildings and old trees, and it's a very suitable habitat.
However, there is still a lot that is unknown about bats, so with our work here and in other parks, we will understand what they need to stay healthy".
Thompson has pointed out that it is very important to verify if there are bats before any maintenance work is done on the property, because if one maternal nest is accidentally destroyed, 400 female bats and young may die, and perhaps the entire local population may disappear.
Bats are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill, harass, or harass them, even destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the representative of the Bat Protection Organization, has appealed to the general population for help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how many of the species that live with us are doing".
Ronaldo has dropped the rape charges, while his lawyers are rushing to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed that the allegations of rape against him are "false news" and that those who did it are only trying to "get publicity" using his name.
They are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, whose lawyer has filed a complaint.
A Portuguese and Juventus forward named Kathryn Mayorga has been charged with raping a woman in Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he allegedly paid him $375,000 for keeping the incident a secret, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the indictment was released, the 33-year-old Ronaldo has made a live Instagram video for 142 million followers on his platform, where he claims the accusations are "false news".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
"This is a fake news", said the five-time Golden Ball winner.
They want to get publicity using my name.
That's normal.
They want to make a name for themselves by saying my name, but that's what happens in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything is fine", said the player, smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sell the Spiegel because of the allegations that it is unacceptable to publish information about suspicions of privacy.
"The lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will seek damages in connection with the seriousness of the gambling, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a hotel and casino suite in Palms, Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's bedroom where he allegedly raped her from the hip, according to documents from the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had knelt after the alleged incident, and said he was a good man in 99 percent but he was a bad man in 1 percent".
The documents show that the couple admitted to having sexual intercourse, but that the relationship was authorized.
Mayorg also said she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later reached an out-of-court settlement because she was terrified of reprisals and worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old said she plans to withdraw her deal because she is still traumatized by an alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on his way to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve, following a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK will regret forever losing the car manufacturers
The UK will regret for ever ceasing to lead car manufacturers after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He also said it was "disappointing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker has said that the delay in customs due to a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory (which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concern that they do not know how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern for car manufacturers is the risks to the supply chain if Brexit is implemented without a deal.
Toyota's production line is up-to-date with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from suppliers in the UK and the European Union, for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the borders and, as a result, delays and parts being unable to be delivered.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire factory, and as a result, production would have to be halted.
According to Clark, Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for the future of EU relations is specifically designed to prevent such customs checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, not only to ensure the current success, but to take advantage of this opportunity in the future", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Other manufacturers besides Toyota have proven the vital importance of maintaining highly successful supply chains in their own way".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be suspended, but warned that, in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for Burnaston for 24 years and is the factory coordinator for Unite union, said the members are increasingly worried: "I experience that if we lose these jobs we will not get them back.
A government spokesman said, "We have presented a concrete and credible plan for the future of our relations with the European Union".
The White House has said that the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again.
The important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by another week as the debate over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's influence on the U.S. election, the link between Trump aides and Russia, and the alleged obstruction of justice by the president.
There has been some debate in Washington over whether Trump's firing of the deputy attorney general would jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered carrying a hidden microphone to record his conversations with Trump, as well as removing the president from office under Article 25 of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, where he was reportedly resigning.
Instead, he said he was meeting with Trump on Thursday, at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump has said he prefers not to fire Rosenstein, but later postponed the meeting to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh, which has delayed the Senate vote even further.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There's no date yet; it might be this week, but I would understand a delay of another week, given all that's going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists will disagree with this statement because Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked him why.
Sanderson said that the press conference was not about the fact that TV reporters were "bigots", but he said, "I agree they are bigots".
He then suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does a lot more questioning than his predecessors", he said, adding, without mentioning evidence, "We've verified these statistics".
Sanders said they'll continue to hold press conferences, but if the press can ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's much better than asking me.
We've tried to do that many times, and you've seen that we've done it many times in the past few weeks, and that will replace the press conference when we have the opportunity to speak to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House, attends opening sessions, or visits dignitaries at press conferences.
He doesn't usually hold his own press conference.
The possible reason for this was revealed by the president of the United States this week in New York, where he made a spontaneous and sometimes bizarre appearance before reporters gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health in the UK has written a letter to the EU workers working in Scotland's NHS system, expressing concerns about Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU workers working in Scotland's NHS health system, thanking the whole country for their support and asking them to stay there after Brexit.
In a letter to the British Parliament, Scottish MP, Jeane Freeman, she wrote that the UK is less than six months away from leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the cost of requests for settled status for EU citizens working in public services.
Freeman said in his letter, "Over the summer, the Brexit negotiations have progressed between the UK and the EU, and a decision is expected by autumn.
However, the UK government has stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
That's why I want to confirm that I highly appreciate the contribution of every employee, whatever their nationality.
Our partners in the European Union, as well as those outside, bring us valuable experience and skills, and they improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, no doubt about it, and we hope you will live with us".
Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery for a head injury after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
According to Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed, the player suffered a head injury just before the halftime break.
"He went to the nearby airport and passed out", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff have given Abercrombie oxygen in the band and have taken him to a bed for further medical examination.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that he was out of surgery and was in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said no details have yet been released on the type of injury or its severity, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He's in his second year with the Abercrombie Redshirters, and he's in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five playoff appearances before leaving the game on Saturday, making a total of 18 playoff appearances throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher tax on the bells when they buy property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the bells when they buy real estate in the UK, and that additional amount will be used to help those left homeless, according to the plans of the Conservative Party.
This strategy is intended to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
In the UK, for tax-exempt people, the tax on the ring will be raised.
The Treasury estimates that an additional £120 million a year will be raised to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the bells when they buy real estate in the UK, and the additional amount will be used to help those who are homeless, Theresa May said today.
The strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters, by promising to provide affordable housing and raise taxes for those with the highest incomes.
In the UK, the tax on the toll will be raised for individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes, and the government will use the additional amount raised to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is an addition to the current bells tax (including high taxes on second homes and rental properties purchased two years ago), can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that they will raise an additional £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's built-up properties are bought by non-UK residents, resulting in rising prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
The country's affluent areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns, as foreign buyers tend to spend most of their time outside the city.
To help young people buy their first home comes after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax on bells, and this new policy is precisely what it is.
He has charged large construction companies with keeping property prices high by buying and leaving land unused and has asked May to set aside quotas for homes with reasonable prices to address the UK housing crisis".
Corbyn, for his part, has introduced some attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and unreasonable evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build more housing.
May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate my presidency to the restoration of the British dream, to the betterment of the lives of each new generation.
That means fixing the corrupt housing market.
The gates of Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and organize their lives.
However, it's not fair for people outside the UK and for British citizens who work hard for foreign companies to buy a home.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far-fetched, and we still have a shortage of people sleeping on the streets".
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to be the coach of the Scottish team".
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland, says his greatest ambition is to be the coach of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, which is in third place in League One, three points from the first place.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won a B League trophy, and that was it", Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I've watched the Scottish games with my father in Hampden since I was a kid, and I've always wanted to go back.
But I would have had the chance if I had the ability to manage the club".
Among those who have coached Sunderland before Ross are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa, former Athletic boss, has said he was not nervous about coming after such big names; in fact, he had refused offers to coach Barnsley and Ipswich Town before.
"To measure success, I have to ask myself, can I get the club back to the Premier League?
Given the structure and facilities of the club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not going to be easy to get there, but I won't consider myself a success if I don't get there".
Ross has only been coaching for three years, serving as assistant to Dumbarton's boss for a while and one of the Hearts' coaching staff after 15 months.
He then helped Allo regain his place after being relegated to the third tier, and thanks to him, he also went from being on the verge of relegation to the St Mir's championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads for me, perhaps", he said of taking over the management of Allo.
"I really thought being a coach was the best job for me, rather than being a player.
It's funny to say that, because I was a good gambler, I made a good living, and I had some great moments of fame.
But playing can be hard.
You have a lot to go through every week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but I'm comfortable as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now that I'm doing that, I feel more comfortable in my skin than ever".
The full interview will be broadcast on 30 September (Sunday) on Radio Scotland's Sportsound between 12:00 and 13:00 (BST).
Saturday's 5:30 is the best time to get a drink, according to a poll.
The summer heat wave has led to a huge rise in the revenue of pubs across the UK, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Sales of pubs and bars have increased 2.7 percent, while restaurant sales have fallen 4.8 percent, according to the data.
Peter Martin, who works at the CGA's corporate consultancy who collected the data, said: "As the sun has been shining continuously, and the England team has lasted longer than expected at the World Cup, the data for July are similar to those for June, where pubs' revenues have risen 2.8 percent, but restaurants have fallen even further.
Although restaurant sales fell 1.8 percent in June, they were even worse in July.
Pubs and bars specializing in beverages have performed much better, and their rise has been greater than the decline in restaurant sales.
Even the pubs specializing in food have suffered from the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Apparently, people just want a drink.
Pub and bar sales have risen 6.6 percent in the past month, while food sales have fallen 3 percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said, "These results are a follow-up to the trend we've seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of social and sporting events are the most important factors in terms of sales of out-of-home trade.
It's no surprise that restaurant chains are experiencing economic hardship, and a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will cause significant damage, in addition to continued cost pressure.
The long, hot summer is coming at the perfect time for food establishments, and it remains to be seen if the moderate temperatures of August will provide a calming effect".
Sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, rose 2.7 percent in July, as the chain's expansion slowed.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants across the UK by collecting and analysing performance data from 47 groups of operators, which together have revenues of over £9bn.
One in five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) has accounts they hide from their parents and teachers on social media, according to one survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that there has been a rise in fake Instagram accounts.
And because of this news, the fear of sexual content being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a big account that parents can see.
But one in five children (some as young as 11) have accounts they hide from adults on social media.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that there has been a significant increase in fake Instagram accounts (the photo sharing site is Instagram).
And because of this news, the fear of publishing sexual content has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a clear, adult account that parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website where a teenager told others, "Force me".
This study by the UK-based company Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors in Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said, "It's disturbing that teens are tempted to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers can't find".
Eilidh Doyle will be the athlete's spokesperson for the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed ex-CEO of the Scottish Athletic Council at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded athlete, and director Ian Beattie said this change will provide a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of his vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we know that her membership in the board will be very valuable to Scottish athletics", said Beatti.
Doyle said, "I am very proud to be the athlete's spokesperson, and I hope to make a significant contribution to the sport in Scotland".
The American won the 200 and 400 meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and has four gold medals in total. Today, she is a BBC presenter.
She tweeted, "A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was only a matter of time before I recovered or how much.
It was really hard, but I've recovered completely, and I've had to learn to walk again, and I've been doing some skill tests today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages you sent me!"
An ad for a milkman who compares his mother to a cow has generated conflicting opinions on the Internet.
A dairy company has published conflicting opinions on the Internet about breastfeeding cows.
To present what is believed to be the world's first silent milk extraction laptop, Elvie, a consumer technology company, has released a humorous ad inspired by a music video to showcase the freedom that the new device gives milk-producing mothers.
Four women who are actually mothers are dancing in a barn full of hay with a song that has these words and things like, "Yeah, I'm getting my hair done, but I'm not stuck, and you might not have noticed, but these aren't the straws, these are my tits".
This is the motto, "Take milk, take milk, give it to babies, take milk, take milk, I am giving my girls a baby".
However, this ad, which the company posted on its Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated a wide variety of reactions from the audience, and many have said that he doesn't take the whimsical vices of the dairy industry seriously.
"It was a terrible mistake to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but they steal their cubs within days of their birth", said one user.
Elvie can enter one of the breast pads for breastfeeding.
Someone else said, "Very traumatic, of course, for the mother and the puppy.
But, well, why not use it to advertise a dream milk extract that doesn't take away babies?"
Someone else added, "This ad is not polite".
But others have defended the ad, saying that a woman made him laugh".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
When I was breastfeeding, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but that's the point.
It's a great product", wrote one user.
Another commented, "It's a funny ad, aimed at milk-sucking moms (often having to do it in workplaces or in bathrooms), who feel like they're in need".
He has no intention of praising or judging the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women show that they've been dancing with a milk-drain on their breast collar.
Many women who breastfeed milk are considered to feel like cows in the campaign.
The Elvie milk drain is completely silent, with no wires or tubes, and can be carried discreetly in one of the breastplate, where the woman can move as she pleases, carry babies on her arms, or go out.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, commented: "Elvie milk extract is a very revolutionary product, and therefore required a bold and provocative presentation.
With this parallel between women who are lactating and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the whole process of lactation and its challenges, and at the same time, to express the freedom that lactation brings in a fun and intimate way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milk-letting has attracted attention.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of children have been quietly taken to a campsite on the Texas border.
The number of detected migrant children has increased dramatically in recent times, although the monthly limitation is roughly the same; one of the reasons is because of the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and guidelines that have made it harder to get babies to the shelter.
Until now, undocumented immigrants have been the majority of our patrons, but now they fear registering to protect their children, they may lose their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities said that those who wanted to be sponsors and other adults living in their homes would be required to send fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, confessed to Congress that dozens of people were arrested who demanded protection for minors who arrived without due care.
That agency later confirmed that 70 percent of them had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or those living with them are in our country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still catching them", Albence said.
To speed up the processing of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules that require babies to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days as before, as the shelter workers say.
Many of them will be on a video conference call asking an immigration judge for legal status.
If they are not considered eligible for assistance, they will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in care centers, the more likely they are to experience worsening anxiety and depression, which may result in violent anger or escape attempts, according to reports from shelter workers and the system in recent months.
Child advocates say that these concerns are growing in large facilities like Tornillo, because it's so large, there's a greater chance that children's problems will be overlooked.
They also say that if children are taken to camping camps to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends before their age, the trauma they already have can be exacerbated.
Syria has called on the occupying US, French and Turkish Zind to withdraw immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be treated as appropriate.
"They must leave the territory immediately and unconditionally", the committee said.
Moualem says the war on terror in Syria is almost over, 360,000 people have died in it since 2011, and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in the holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs.
France, on the other hand, has 1,000 troops on the territory of the country that destroyed the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there are appropriate conditions for their return, and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing anything but humanitarian issues".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
Recently, Russia and Turkey have reached an agreement to create a safe zone in the last stronghold of the insurgents in Idlib, which, according to UN diplomats, is a potential for promoting political dialogue.
This agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack that Syrian forces backed by Russia could carry out in this province of three million people.
However, Moualem said the deal had clear terms and stated that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "dissolved".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of the new assembly between members of the government and the opposition will begin to form a post-war constitution and also to begin to pave the way for elections.
Moualem has set certain conditions for the Syrian government's participation in that meeting, stating that the work of the assembly should be limited to the revision of the articles of the constitution of the Republic of Juna, and warning that no one else should be involved.
Why will Trump win a second time?
Following this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless (as many Democratic Party viewers probably expect) a dismissal process or scandals finish his presidency before it is needed.
That would be the most dramatic end of a presidency".
So far, the audience doesn't seem tired.
Since 2014, the viewership of the most-watched CNN channel has nearly doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC's has tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million viewers on that hour, up 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the highest viewership on cable television, reaching 3.5 million viewers on the nights of major news events.

Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy-drama writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Before the 2016 election, he was in a taxi in Boston.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
Scovell asked him why.
"Because he thought it made him laugh", Scovell said.
There's time for entertainment in chaos.
Of course, like anything else on TV, the stories from Washington are about the future of abortion law, the ability of immigrant families to reunite, and the health of the global economy.
Only privileged viewers can disconnect.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you spend six hours watching an expert debate on a variety of topics: how Bob Woodward used deep precedents to write his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-coated jacket (a suit full of shells, according to The Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels' bizarre way of describing Trump's anatomy.
I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars, says this about the changing character and arguments of Trump's show (debating with the National Football League, praising Kim Jong-un): "It gives the feeling of being a reality show, giving you something to consume every day.

When I met Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees and it was sunny in his house on the northern coast of Kaua'i, but he was locked inside the house watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He couldn't turn away from the TV, especially now that Brett Kavanaugh has to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"When I was doing these weird TV shows a long time ago, people said it was the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Foreign money is pouring in to the most equal elections in the US Congress.
It's no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is receiving an abundance of money, because congressional districts have been reorganized, and as a result, two candidates are vying for the same seat.
In that district of Pittsburgh, whose boundaries have recently been rearranged, Democratic Party representative Conor Lamb won his seat in a special election in another district.
Lamb's opponent is another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th District, which is significantly overlapping with the 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated contrary to what the Constitution says in favor of the Republicans, and as a result, the boundaries of the map were properly delineated.
This new competition in the 17th District has led to intense competition for campaign finance from the main sources of party funding: the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania when he narrowly won the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The seat was held by a Republican for the past decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators say the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, but later withdrew the decision.
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which Washington has barely asked to withdraw.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until the partners decided to dismiss the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, following new decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan, according to department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received $140 million from the United States in 2017 as aid, including to control drug trafficking, promote development and support the economy.
The proposed sanctions include a reduction in financial aid and voluntary visa restrictions, which would be extremely damaging to the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was intended to be a follow-up to a similar meeting held the previous year, and was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold a conference, and thus announced that the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador had been suspended.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend the conference, which has been moved to mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, according to diplomats.
Three U.S. ambassadors have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in secret, without a message from Washington or severe punishment.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House has declined to comment on details of the dispute, which were provided by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to report internal disputes in exchange for anonymity.
An analyst who has been in close contact with the administration and has spoken anonymously has confirmed their claims.
Learn the history.
Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report will be released soon, which will reveal whether Trump obstructed justice, as there is plenty of evidence of that in the public eye.
In addition, Mueller is reportedly investigating whether Russia was involved in Trump's campaign in the US election attack.
If the majority in Congress changes to a party, Trump will have to give him instructions, while he prepares to appear again before the voters (and perhaps someday a jury of his peers).
There are many conditions for that, though, and I'm not talking about the inevitable collapse of Trump, or of his European counterpart.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and it will depend on them to determine the length of the conflict.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western countries held back and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the chance to avoid the massacre of the years that followed.
History has been filled with such turning points that have either accelerated or delayed the inevitable progress of democracy.
The American people are facing such turning points right now.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in control of the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's job has been in jeopardy since this newspaper reported last year that it suggested filming the president in secret, and that the president was unfit for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times's claims are not true.
"How will we respond to the FBI's recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh if it is incomplete or unfair, or if he receives a return to the Supreme Court, despite credible accusations of sexual assault and perjury?"
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections to form a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, it will be a red winter for democracy.
But I really think we can overcome them, based on what I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the rivalry with Rapid Vienna.
Rapid will be a guest of the Rangers on Thursday, knowing that if they beat the Austrians, after the exciting draw with Spain's Villarreal a few weeks ago, they will be in a perfect position to qualify for the Europa League G-team.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans suffered a knee injury which prevented him from making his first appearance of the season until the draw with Villarreal in the 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use that as a springboard to get better things.
"It was a good result, because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
"We played with the intention of getting something, and we ended up getting a point.
Maybe we could have had a chance to win the final, but it's probably a draw.
The first half they grew older, the second half we were older.
Thursday night is going to be a big night for the European Championship.
We expect to get three points, but it's going to be hard because they did a good job in the last game, but the audience is on our side, and I'm sure we'll move on and get a positive result.
Last year was a tough one, I got injured and the club changed, but right now it's a positive atmosphere.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying it, and the training is good.
I think we're going to move on, forget about last season and make it happen".
Women are very worried about a problem with their retirement savings.
The survey participants knew what kind of care they wanted to be given, but very few told their family members about it.
Half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they've talked to their partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about it.
"We want some family member to wait for us, but we don't dare to ask", explained Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance company Nationwide.
Here are the first steps.
Talk to your spouse and children, and the family won't be willing to take care of you unless you ask them to.
Work with a counselor and family to decide where and how you want to receive care, as the cost of care will depend on these options.
Ask a counselor for help, and a counselor can help you figure out how to pay those expenses.
You have more than one option to finance long-term care, including a regular long-term care insurance, a hybrid insurance that allows you to pay for the care costs in cash, and an insurance that can be paid with your own money instantly if you have that money.
Clear the legal documents, forget the legal disputes.
Choose a trusted person to take care of your health, and make sure that you are taken care of the way you want to be if you are not able to ask for it.
Also, ask a lawyer to handle your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person to make financial choices on your behalf and, when you are unable to do so, make sure you pay your bills.
And don't forget the details: let's say your parents are elderly and one of them has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer any questions about medications or allergies?
Write down those details in a written plan so you're prepared.
"Finances are at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and officials say the death toll will rise.
With the communication systems down, rescue agents were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, which is the area closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, north of Palou.
Please, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here is some important information about the city of Palu on Sulawesi Island and the Donggala government:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island; in 2017, it had a population of about 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government that covers an area of over 300 km (180 mi) that forms the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which is the administrative county of the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the Donggala coastal region.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, Paluk and Donggala have suffered numerous tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died and hundreds of homes were destroyed in a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone known as the Pacific Fire Belt, which is a frequent earthquake.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake hit the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami that shook 14 countries, and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Between late March and early April, several strong earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java (Indonesia's most populous island), causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast with heavy force, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the southern Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a maximum of 10 metres (10 feet) of tsunami, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck in Pidie Jaya's Aceh government, bringing disaster and fear as people remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami at the time, but over 100 people died as buildings were crushed.
2018: Several major earthquakes occurred on the island of Lombok, Indonesia, which is so popular with tourists, killing more than 500 people, especially in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor and vice presidential candidate of Alaska, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing a domestic violence case and resisting authority, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers division.
According to the police report, when a woman started calling the police to report a suspected crime, Palin took her phone away.
According to KTUU, he is in the Mat-Su Pre-trial facility in Palin, under preventive custody and a $500 bail.
On the Sabbath Jesus went to the Sanhedrin and made his accusation, but he was not guilty because the nets were opening.
Palin is charged with three felony counts of Class A misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was charged with assault.
My mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Right now, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing a domestic violence offender's indictment and possession of a weapon while drunk.
Her girlfriend said she hit him hard.
When her son's aggressive behavior was linked to the post-traumatic stress imbalance caused by his experiences in Iraq, Sarah Palin received harsh criticism in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after a quake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the centre of Sulawesi, which is in the north-east of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
There are a number of videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
In fact, because of a beach festival in Palu, hundreds of people were there when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutor's office wants a special death sentence for the suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City. The last time such a sentence was imposed for a federal crime in the state was in 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented truck at Home Depot for his attack on the West Side Highway intersection in South Manhattan, before taking away all pedestrians and bicyclists in that October attack.
To justify the death sentence, the prosecution will have to prove that Saipov killed eight of those people and seriously injured several others, according to the intent notice of the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the legal documents, in both cases, the death penalty could be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in favor of organized crime, which the federal prosecutor's office uses in organized crime cases, and one count of motor vehicle violence and destruction.
The prosecution said the attack had to be planned, as Saipov was "cruel", and described it as so.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov's actions resulted in injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of the following individuals: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the intent notice.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last sued a death penalty case.
Then, accused Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last time a federal case in New York was sentenced to death was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbek Saipov showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he had told investigators he had no regrets about what he had done.
According to the complaint, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching a video of ISIS on his mobile phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be flown in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, who is one of the federal public defenders responsible for replacing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of the people affected by these incidents", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutor not to ask for the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farragh should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has ordered the mobilization of the People's Army today at a protest conference of the Conservative Party.
The former UKIP party leader has said politicians should feel the warmth of eurosceptics, and Theresa May's parliamentarians have suggested that he be in charge of negotiations with the UK.
Conservative MP Peter Bone explained to participants in the Birmingham March that the UK would be "outside" if Mr Farage was already Brexit Secretary.
But the Conservatives who support staying have organized a protest against Brexit in the city, highlighting the challenge that Mrs May faces: reconciling the completely divided ranks.
Prime Minister Chequers is trying to push ahead with his commitment plan, but he is also under attack from Brexit supporters, staying-in supporters and the EU.
The Allies believe that he will move forward and try to reach an agreement with Brussels, leaving aside such reactions, and force the eurosceptics and farmers to decide between its offer or the chaos.
Mr Bone has explained to the participants of the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihulle that he wants to fire Chequers.
He also stated that he should cooperate with Mr. Farage and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out of here", he said.
The Wellingborough Party MP added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must fire Chequers".
In his defense of the Jews, he said: "We did not fight worldly wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected the fact that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "It's a lie that the British have changed their minds and want to stay".
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party and Brexit supporter, also took part in the march, and told reporters, "All I can say is, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the people, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular with our party members, nor is he popular with our activists who are shaking the streets and making it possible for us to win elections.
Put the Chequers aside and start listening.
Addressing Mrs. May, he added: "Prime ministers, to remain in office, must keep their word.
Mr. Farage told the protesters that politicians should be forced to feel warm if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that we're not going to let them go out with theirs.
Addressing the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to feel warm to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the army of the people who gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the UK becomes independent, autonomous and proud.
Meanwhile, pro-Restablishment protesters marched through Birmingham's downtown before a two-hour march.
A few activists raised anti-Brexit signs after this weekend's group lunch.
His Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives at the start of the conference over security concerns they had with the party's application.
These are the people who tell us that ICT systems can make it work properly, and in Ireland, he added the whole technology of Canada plus plus chain, frictionless unlimited, free trade unlimited.
That's a big lie.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren will seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be very excited to consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a general meeting Saturday in the Massachusetts Western Town Hall.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November, against Republican State Deputy Secretary Geoff Diehl; Diehl was Trump's vice president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They say he could take Trump's place in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting that Trump held with his council members since taking office as a full council meeting.
One of the participants asked him if he intended to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman must be in charge.
A suspect has been arrested in the shooting that killed Sims at Louisiana State University.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in a shooting that killed the basketball player Wayde Sims of Louisiana State University on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11:00 a.m. eastern time.
Earlier, he posted a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying a man who was on it.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the southern campus.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which ultimately led to his death, police chief Murphy J. Paul told Saturday's newspaper via 247sports.
Wayde got involved in a conflict trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated, and he admitted to being there, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, Ga., nearly two-foot-tall, played 32 10-star games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes of play, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world title thanks to team orders after defeating Sebastian Vettel
It became clear that since Valtteri Bottas took the lead on Saturday over Lewis Hamilton, the Mercedes team's orders were life and death.
From the start, Bottas performed brilliantly, and almost fired Hamilton to defend his place in the first two rounds, inviting his teammate Vettel to attack.
Vettel entered the boxing first, and Hamilton had to enter the end of the trope traffic, which should have had a direct impact on the race.
A Mercedes tour later entered the boxing, and he left behind Vettel, but after a competition Hamilton took the lead; in fact, in the competition, he was released from the inside by Ferrari driver, in order to hold his position, after making a double move to defend the third corner.
On that day, 21 year old Max Verstappen started the race in the final lap of the start-parril, finishing in seventh place on his first lap.
He subsequently held the top spot for much of the race, and by the end, he had held the tyres to a quick finish and to advance Kimi Raikkon to fourth place.
He finally entered the boxing at the 44th round, but was unable to keep up with the pace for the remaining eight rounds, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's not an easy day, Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and he was really honest.
The team did a great job in the competition, Hamilton said.
They were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein during a demonstration Saturday for not leaking the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault on the Supreme Court nominee.
When speaking at a demonstration in West Virginia, the president did not directly reference Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, false, and liars".
"The only thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate these last few days, is that you see anger, you see angry people, you see people are evil, fake and lying", he said.
You see the news and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me".
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Do you remember her answer? Did you leak the letter?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't, he added, mimicking the senator's reaction.
The letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh went forward by Ford to Feinstein in July, and leaked last September, but Feinstein denies the leak occurred in his office.
"I have not concealed any allegations of Dr. Ford; I have not leaked his story", Feinstein explained to the committee, as The Hill newspaper has disclosed.
He asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, just as he asked.
But his denial was not welcomed by the president, who said this during the demonstration on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, they were inappropriate gestures.
It may not have been him, but they were the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen.
Following the defense of the Supreme Court's nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They're willing to do anything to regain power.
They're evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they must crush to gain power and control, the president said, as the Mediaite site has disclosed.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars regained their Elite League title on Saturday after losing to the Belfast Giants on Friday, winning 5-3 in the second-choice game played at Dundee.
He started to beat the Giants, with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the draw, but the Giants quickly regained the lead.
Francois Bouchard brought the tie back to Dundee, and in the end, Lukas Lundvald Nielsen was guaranteed a two-goal victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's boyhood, who lost 2-1 to Dundee in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for both teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute, 3:35, thanks to Kendall McFaull's help, and four minutes later, David Rutherford helped Beauvillier, who doubled the score.
It was a good start, as Sullivan brought the tie to the 13:10 mark, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie score the goal at 15:16.
Dwyer wanted to make sure the Giants had the score on his side in the first half, and at the end of the first half, he scored his second goal of the night.
But the home team reorganized and Bouchard brought the draw back with a goal in the 27th minute.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen and give Dundee the lead in the game for the first time, and, in the end, they brought the team the fifth goal and, together with it, the victory.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller died to help hundreds of passengers escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers was properly flown.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday and a tsunami.
There have been numerous strong replicas in the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of Palu City.
Although his colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and leave the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
Instead, he stayed there to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321 was properly flown, which was on the runway at the time.
Next, he jumped from the control tower when he saw it collapsing.
She died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Navigation Service, said the decision saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to take him to a larger hospital in another city in Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palula.
"Our hearts break when we hear that", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death rate will rise to thousands, and the Indonesian Disaster Management Bureau says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
The rate is expected to continue to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many others have not been reached, said the Bureau's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Negroho.
A maximum of six metres of waves have completely destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in supplies and support.
Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "A minute later, an ambulance full of bodies arrives.
There's not enough clean water.
People are stealing all the food from small markets.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as fast as possible to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palura on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN has announced.
Another earthquake has hit Indonesia this year, in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports a man has gone missing after the plane crash in a lake.
The airline operating the flight that crashed into a lake in the Pacific in Micronesia now reports a man is missing after reporting that 47 passengers and crew were properly evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it could not confirm until Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to reporters who asked for more details about the passenger (such as age or nationality).
Thanks to local boats, the rest of the passengers and crew were rescued after the plane crashed into the water as Chuu was about to land at the island's airport.
According to the police on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
According to the airline and the US military, the plane crashed into a lake near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down too low.
"That's a really good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to easily reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane, which reached their waist in the water ahead.
He said the survivors were scared and they were fighting, and he had a small head wound.
The U.S. military said that the assistance of fishermen working on improvements to the harbor around the area was also a major aid in the rescue effort, for which an inflatable boat was used to carry passengers ashore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none were caused by Air Niugini.
An analyst has compiled a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor postponed the case on Saturday for a new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He testified before the jury that he used cell phone records of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers to link the movements made on the night the woman died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing she was with Tellis Chambers the night she died; thus, she denied Tellis' previous confirmation, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers's at the time Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because the truck was in Nashville.
There was also another inconsistency, Tellis said that he met Chambers two weeks after he died.
But according to cell phone records, they met only a week ago.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped it out", Hale said.
The defense will begin on Sunday with the final charges.
The judge said the jury will hear the case that day.
What is hip-hop consciousness?
A trio of hip-hop musicians are challenging people who have negative opinions about their music genre, and to do that, they're going to fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed in Bristol say hip-hop music has abandoned its early political messages and social struggles.
They want to go back to its roots, and get the conscious hip-hop to be popular again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen a resurgence of hip hop in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?
A New York nanny has sued a couple for firing her after a racist message.
A New York nanny has sued a couple for discriminating against them and firing them for a mistake that was not for her and that she was another black woman.
The couple denied that he was racist, saying the accusation was "excessive".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was surprised to learn that the new employee who would take care of the children, Giselle Maurice, was black when Maurice returned home on her first day of work in 2016.
"Everything is fine", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and twice
According to the New York Post, when he realized the mistake, Plasco-Flaxman reportedly felt "uncomfortable" and fired Miss Maurice, a former babysitter who was African-American, saying she was not a good worker and was expecting a Filipino babysitter instead.
He paid Miss Maurice for that one day's work, and he asked for an Uber to take her home.
Now Maurice has sued the couple, and has asked for compensation for damages caused by the dismissal, including $350 a day for six months; because, despite being without a contract, he was initially hired to live at home for six months and take care of her.
"I want to show them that these things don't happen", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied he was racist, saying that it was reasonable and necessary to fire Maurice because they feared they would not be able to trust him after he insulted him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists, Joel Plasco explained to the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have insulted, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Not at all.
When explaining that the accusation was not for the worst, Plasco said that his wife had had a baby of less than two months and that she was in a difficult condition.
Are you going to look for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude, the investment banker added.
The legal case is still ongoing, and the court of public opinion has quickly indicted the couple on social media, punishing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not like a talking bear, as a new letter has shown.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter, "It's hard to put someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published in place.
It's so funny to know what we know about Paddington's big success now.
Her father was a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book by a little toy bear; her daughter said that her father took a positive attitude because people rejected her work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a "good-goose" taste, as she died last year.
As for Paddington, he claims to have been an important member of the family, and that his father was proud of his eventual success.
He was a quiet man, and he was not arrogant, he said.
But Paddington was so real to him that he almost made him feel like a child who's accomplishing something, you're proud of him, even though it's not really your accomplishment.
I think that's pretty much how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he was the creator of his imagination, Paddington always acknowledged his merit.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello on the phone.
As soon as she landed, she was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, but the doctors could do nothing to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that he was serious, that he didn't think he was going to get out", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
And then I got a call from Nad, saying that he was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors gave her a heartbeat to keep her going. The drugs were running out and she was slowly leaving her system.
He died a little sooner than I thought, and it was over.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing it was gonna start there.
I couldn't stop crying because I was surrounded by family and people.
I should have held on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was saddened by her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgetting all her sadness.
"No one knew", he said.
I was bowed down, and I kept on shedding tears.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him.
Some frustrated women have put up signs on a bridge to prevent people from committing suicide.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide want to avoid more people taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up signs on a bridge in Wales, signs that have positive messages and phone numbers, so people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to experience depression, and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son had a special gift for cooking and a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile would light up everything.
But before he died, he quit his job, because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried about the domino effect".
Mrs. Davis created some signs so people would know that you can tell them what's going on with you and people who can help you, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep quiet, you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and he too lost his partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after the death of his mother.
He didn't say he was sad or depressed, he said.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed his attitude.
On Christmas Day, she was so sad that when the children opened their presents, he did not look at them.
She said her death was a major trauma for them, but they need to move on: "It leaves a hole in the family".
It's a mess.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake after the FBI investigation.
"I thought, if we could get something like what he asked for, like a limited-time or limited-district investigation, maybe we could get some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared he was breaking up the committee in the face of the obstacle caused by the party's zeal.
Why didn't they want the FBI to investigate the case?
The opposite is the time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, which are scheduled for November 6, when the Republicans are expected to get bad results, and if so, they will begin their race for the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court very weakly.
George W. Bush has made numerous phone calls to senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There's a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently seated.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, or if he does, Vice President Mike Pence could break the tie and take him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has fallen since Kim came to power.
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Reunification Department, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher fines on human traffickers has had a significant impact.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Sooner or later, almost all North Korean refugees will be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas with strict protective measures.
China considers illegal immigrants as refugees, not refugees, and often forced return.
North Korea and South Korea are still at war, and their relations have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
Earlier, in June, a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons was agreed.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused them of not making any progress since then on the US sanctions.
"If we have no confidence in America, we will have no confidence in our national security, and, as such, we will not be the first to lay down our arms", Mr. Ri said at a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi told Brett Kavanaugh she was hysterical, and she wasn't ready to go to the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court "hysterical" and, as far as genius is concerned, not ready to be on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview with her on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival event held in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would have called it 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said, "that was the reaction Kavanaugh had to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted when they were both teenagers.
In the opening speech, Kavanaugh was so sensitive, and sometimes he almost screamed and started to giggle when he talked about his family and his youth.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats in the Committee, who said the allegations against him were "organized and offensive" by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony made it clear that he cannot be in the Supreme Court because he has shown an impartial anti-Democratic stance.
"With these confirmations and his attitude toward the Clintons and Democrats, he's out of the league", he said.
Pelosi objected to Kavanaugh's election and asked if she would oppose him if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If she doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then she's not ready to be in the Supreme Court or the court she's in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which applies conservative justice.
In the re-trial, Kavanaugh avoided questions when asked if he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"A hysterical and impartial person cannot go to court and expect us to welcome him", Pelosi said.
And women are to lead.
It's a fair speech, a terrible rage of months and years, and she can't let go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's weird, do I?
She went on to say, "A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot, and she told me that she cried when she got angry, too, but she developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "Because I'm crying, you might think I'm sad.
But I'm angry.
And then he kept moving forward.
And I thought it was a great idea.
Tears are not badly seen to express anger, because they are somewhat misinterpreted.
I remember clearly something that happened to me in one of my first jobs -- mostly a men's office -- where I was crying furiously once, and an older woman grabbed me by the neck -- and I was a little scared at first -- she was the cold boss, and she took me to the top of the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you crying", she said.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good about you because they understood you.
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, and she worked with Gary Hart on his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Monkey Business and found out that he had a love affair with a woman other than his wife and refused to run, Ms. Schroeder, devastated, decided to run for the same presidency.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", she laughed at me 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them the White Dwarf and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign started a long time ago, he was following the money, so he decided not to enter the race until he had raised $2 million.
The fight was a loss.
He learned that some of his followers who gave the men $1,000 only got $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and announced that he would not run an official campaign, he was so moved by the people he supported, the gratitude, and the fact that it was so difficult to get voters instead of representatives, frustration with the system, and anger at sexist attitudes, that he finally spoke up.
"You may have thought I was nervous", Ms. Schroeder explained about the press' reaction to her attitude.
You must have thought Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my gravestone?
Did she cry?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing.
The trade war between the United States and China was a turbulent one, and even though there is a fierce conflict, the gaps between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The first warning was issued by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, when he imposed a tax on China's main exports of products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week, with new tariffs on products worth $200 billion (£150 billion) that will apply to half of the goods shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated, most recently raising tariffs between 5 and 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has said it will level every American rise, and the world's second-most powerful economy will not blink so easily to change its mind.
Asking Washington to return would lead to a lawsuit, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be more embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing does well, the pressures of the US trade war could benefit China in the long run, as it would reduce the dependence between the two economies.
"If politicians in Washington or Beijing make a hasty decision, it would create conditions for economic stagnation in either of the two countries, which is more dangerous than observers previously thought", said researcher Abigail Grace, who works at the New American Security Center with several other experts studying Asia.
Syria is ready to allow the refugees to return, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria says it is ready to allow the willing return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation was improving.
The current situation is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the process of counter-terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that they can return to normal as quickly as possible.
Now, the situation is right for the refugees who willingly want to return to their countries to have to leave terrorism and economic measures that made their daily lives and livelihoods difficult.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help it has given to rebuilding the devastated country.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid or support from countries that supported the rebellions.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
After beating the US team with 10.5 points on the final scoreboard with 16.5 points, the European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup held at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight games on European soil, and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the team of captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson had a rough time almost the entire tournament, and he threw the starting shot into the water on the 16th hole of the third division, thus passing the witness to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer-millennialist excelled a lot in each round, and became one of only four players to ever score 5, 0 and 0 since the tournament's moment format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth scored 5-4 and was eliminated against the worst player in the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, scored 2-1 against the legendary Ian Poulter, and reached the Ryder Cup final.
The Spanish Sergio García, who participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the European champion of the tournament with 25.5 run-points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
So she's thanking Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy, to have my cup back.
This is teamwork, and I'm happy that I was able to help out, Garcia said, excited after the European victory.
He passed the witness to the Spanishman John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods (2 and 1) in a Sunday singles game.
"I feel so proud to have defeated Tiger Woods; I grew up watching that man", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a record of 13-21, and 3 Ryder Cups.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend trying to find a solution to that difficult situation, except for players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury of the United States said this about the team's poor play: "I'm proud of my guys; they tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a moment.
It didn't work.
- I'm going to tell Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have been great.
We'll meet again, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love my 12 boys, and I'm so proud to be their captain.
We have to accept failure.
We're out of the game.
Red tide news: The concentration has dropped in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
According to the latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the concentration of red tide in the Tampa Bay area has dropped significantly.
According to the committee, flowering conditions are more irregular in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colliere counties, and as a result, the concentration is decreasing.
In the flowering, the red tide spreads about 130 miles along the coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The irregularities are within 10 miles of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide has reached Pasco County.
As for the concentrations, the mean are in or near Pinellas County, while the low and high are near Hillsborough County, while the high are near none and the high are in Manatee County, while the high are near none and the middle are in Charlotte County, while the high are near Lee County and the low are in Collier County.
The number of people experiencing respiratory irritation continues to rise in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
But there have been no such cases in Northwest Florida in recent weeks.
