No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by the parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a request to abolish the articles of the Criminal Code under which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the jailed ex-Prime Minister, was rejected by MEPs at second reading on the request for a reduction in the penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for allegedly entering into a disadvantageous contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, and the appeal of the convicts is due to be heard in December.
Tymoshenko himself calls the verdict political revenge by the regime and the trial has also raised suspicions in the West of the court's bias.
The motion, Article 365, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, to remove her from the Penal Code was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been needed to pass it.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion has already had its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
Now it's just a matter of deciding who wins.
As is the custom in this region, Islamists are winning elections, the question is only which - the moderates or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council was committed to the customary law of the Sharīʿa, of which we now have a certain idea with God.
Libya would be a country without crime, because for stealing you cut off your hand.
Women too should quickly forget about emancipation, apostates will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the Koran will unite society of competing tribes.
In short, Libya will be in a state of order that is hardly conceivable and, above all, hardly desirable.
But our way of life is not the only one, and objectively speaking it is not the best either, and it would hardly suit the Libyans mentioned.
It is rather strange that the Muslim fighters should have been helped by the infidel dogs.
Their excuse may be the fact that NATO's air strikes were not led by some American general, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after each successful strike.
The winners in Libya?
We were just taking part in a gunfight, serving the interests of Islam, and our politicians were discharging themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit whatsoever.
After the recent and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to abstain from a military occupation of Libya.
This relieves the local people of one concern - the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But can the oil companies get the black gold at a ridiculous price even without occupation?
The West can hardly and rightly boast of its selflessness in protecting human rights.
Unless the Sharia corrupts them.
The beginning of a new crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The countries published their GDP figures for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared with the previous quarter, with Germany and France growing.
The bond market is now breaking all records.
The investors are not only looking at Greece, but also at Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Euro­zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and a number of other European countries have published their preliminary forecasts for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5% and France's by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% forecast), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (initial data only indicated stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous year.
However, the GDP stagnated compared with the previous quarter, confirming the trend of slowing growth in economic performance, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
So the results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
The euro area as a whole and the EU recorded 0.2% growth between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield on its 10-year government bonds was 28.45%.
The yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems.
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now they celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football team has mastered the toughest challenge of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček, they won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from home and will not be missing from the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge dose of luck in the second.
The Czech national team also won a lucky 1-0 victory in Montenegro thanks to the final defeat of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček, and thus won their ticket to the European Football Championship.
The Czech team's precise defensive play also meant that it was only in the second half that they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins.
The unlucky birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who threw away two huge chances.
The Czech national team will therefore also be competing in the European Championship next year thanks to an outstanding Petr Čech, and it is also gratifying that the Czech national football team will receive a prize of some 200 million.
From the first minutes, quite a fighting football was played.
The two teams combined in a long way, and the game was mainly about the midfield.
In the second half, the pressure of the home team was also absent and the wide shots in front of the penalty area were successfully defended by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They were a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They wanted to show their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to show that they were prepared to protect their country's nuclear program, even with their own lives if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran does not appear to have given up its nuclear weapons efforts for long.
There is also talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack intended to cripple Iran's nuclear program to the greatest extent possible, the Israeli press reports that the nuclear enrichment facility would also be the target of Nathan's attack from the Isfahan center.
The menu of a child with obesity: No breakfast, sausage for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that children with obesity are more likely to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which a person grows up and the examples around him are for his healthy development.
The tables of obese children are half as likely to have sausages on the table as those of normal-weight children.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had fries for dinner the day before the "Obesity Is Not an Accident" education campaign.
In families with fat children, sports are not exactly a favorite activity, but so are the majority of today's students - only 15 percent said that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted towards the end of the school year last year, and involved nearly 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are key factors in the alarming increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed said that they ate breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dinner five times a day - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet", says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as regular family breakfast, are important for a child's healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families have breakfast.
And in most families, everyone has their own breakfast.
The worst finding was that one in ten families does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey revealed that unhealthy fries are consumed much more often in families with overweight children.
And almost everyone, regardless of their weight, drinks sugary lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, less than half of their parents do - only 15 percent.
Make your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own meal plans based on their appetite and opinion.
"The Czech children's preferences for nutrition between 12 and 15 are far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite foods were many flour dishes, meat dishes, and, of course, sweets.
"The alarming thing is the popularity of sweet sodas", the final report of the survey emphasizes.
At lunchtime, the main course, pasta was just ahead of chicken.
The children were almost averse to legumes, and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes for lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the lecture 'Obesity is not a coincidence', a significant shift in preference towards principles of healthy eating was observed in many cases", the project results state.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet lime trees, where many children began to prefer plain water.
The children also had a much higher incidence of choosing poultry or fish as the main course of the day, and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweets.
Professionals say a stylist must be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a little bit of a grunt that this was a little too much material for the beginning.
I had no idea what was coming.
Three industry experts will give talks, clothing for problem figures and a seminar on how to do things on the field.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer we get to the exam, the more information and practical tasks we have to face.
But even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full.
This time we discussed with the director Alena (not a single man attends the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
And that's most of us.
Some have too short a neck, others too youthful a figure without proper curves, and still others are fat.
It is up to the stylist to conceal wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or make the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez -- that is, with big breasts, wide hips, and a narrow waist -- beautifully and in a figure-like manner without being too provocative.
For example, if the gap between your waist and hips is so great that your skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have one piece cut to your size.
You will not regret it, for clothes that fit well are simply priceless.
You feel much better in a tailor-made skirt than in one that is always sliding up and down, sticking out at the waist, etc.
Boyish figures may, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bushes, applications, embroidery or embroidery.
With so much information and so many characters, I'm glad I have a whole week to think it through.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible, given the homework.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to design outfits for - daywear and evening gowns.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to be "putting on" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I'm cheering inside because for me personally, it's much better than wearing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably put on 100 pounds recently (well, that's a bit of an exaggeration), or even young Selena Gomez.
We are to cut the garments out of magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then graphically edit them.
The "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, is intended to express our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the design.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the magazines (according to specifications, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But not until Sunday.
That means a stylist has to have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, which was filled with information on figure types, was immediately flavored by three visitors from the industry:
The first is the design of the new model, designed by Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single garment in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over your jeans as you normally would, like a T-shirt or a coat, but you can also wear it on your naked body, put on slippers and wear it as a dress.
You just slide up the sleeve or the collar, and the whole look is completely different.
"Play with it", he insisted.
But the advice that came to mind most was: "First, you must know the rules perfectly".
"Only then can you hurt her", Jacob said.
I finally understand why we have to fight all these doctrines, what can be combined with what and why, even though you often see in fashion magazines quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing options than he ultimately photographs.
So for a fashion story with ten pages, you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes in the photo, when combined with other accessories, sometimes look quite different from what they really are.
So you have to look at all of that when you're designing your outfit.
That image and style are sometimes half of the success, Jan Pokorný confirmed to us.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer whose image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Even celebrities often think that this is a waste of money (the main thing is that I bring something, my appearance is secondary).
And if someone is going to be styled, we should expect that he or she will most likely force on us a size that is quite different (smaller) from what he or she actually needs.
Then you just have to go to Google to make sure that the tabloids are saying that the celebrity has returned or declined, etc.
Jan and Mario told us on Sunday that we shouldn't believe that a stylist should focus on fashion and then "put together" the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate with the people he stylises and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Judging people without boasting and agreeing with their opinion.
"If some manager asks us to sew up her closet and add nice pieces, we can't just clear out her closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'
"You have to find at least a few things that are commendable that you can recommend to wear", says Mario.
He also showed us in detail what a so-called "square bag" must contain.
So, a bag that you button at the waist and carry all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to clear items such as scissors, hair removal rollers, or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips to be used to grab the back of clothing if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited to prevent the fabric from breaking) and, of course, sewing tools.
But to help us not only listen but also to try something out, we learned how to glue shoes properly.
Even when you're shooting in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of your shoe, let alone the outside.
We were glued and glued...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you don't damage them.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without limitations.
I'm not really good at that skill.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend retreat.
One thing I've come to realize is that it's not easy to become a professional stylist.
V Need for Speed: The Run - the illegal race across America
The review
The originally careless drive becomes a routine drive for the early shift through a series of completely avoidable, dilettante mistakes.
The ambitions were largely met, but what good was it if nobody was willing to do a little more?
Even before it hit the stores, the new episode, subtitled "The Run", was eliciting high expectations.
He promised to take the old Need for Speed series to a new dimension, and in the playable demo examples, it actually didn't seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the customized passages where the main character gets out of the car and walks on.
But as you're used to with NFS, things are much different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they're pretty decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous bugs that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they're not really bugs anymore, but rather signs of a fundamentally incomprehensible laziness on the part of game developers.
The adventure is off to a great start.
For the first time, you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the West Coast, you get behind the wheel, and the task is to be the first to New York.
The basic idea involves a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that each stage takes place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't get the impression for a moment that the game is always offering the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very beautiful, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing that moves the world.
But driving through the desert, through autumn landscape, or high up through deeply snow-covered landscape is visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, unusual elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely limits your view.
In the mountains, you have to be very careful not to get hit by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well integrated.
Just a few, but enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you are still waiting for a personal duel with a single opponent.
And then the police get involved and try to screw it up.
A novelty is the passages where Jack leaves the car.
It's more about certain interactive animations where Jack is running from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (only three, in fact).
In the end, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is to say, from today's point of view, it does not uproot trees, but on the other hand, you could not say that it was bad.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the local model still fits the action-packed racing scene quite well, although you could find better ones in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only come up after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't exactly OK.
You can't expect a game like this to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how the car behaves before you hit anything, then obviously everything is not right.
Typical example: When passing or overtaking oncoming cars, you may "run" the other cars lightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you may get into a sling and spin wild pirouettes.
Or the car goes to waste.
Thanks to the restart system, it's no big deal, but it's annoying all the time.
The restarts are arranged like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue point of the track.
- Only in each race you only get five restarts.
Once you've exhausted them, everything starts again.
So the restarts are more like a tool in case something doesn't work, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes even a restart doesn't help, because the only thing that helps is memorizing the critical section.
What's really unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves have to be done in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Elsewhere, you will encounter "civil" cars at the appropriate location, always in the same configuration, whether you are first or fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent passing two cars in front of you playing, but by the time you get there, the cars are already in a position where you have to go around them or brake.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed to come to this situation right in front of your eyes.
The competitors have other advantages.
There are a few places in the game where you're always overtaken by the same opponent at the same spot and again here regardless of the time.
The craziest part is at the end of the game, on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously overtake you here on the come out.
And when it's in front of you, it's obviously taking your view, so you're going to have to drive your own car a few times in a row.
- Of course you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but that intention is so clear that it quickly deprives you of the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining overall and in some cases so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And it doesn't really matter what the "guilt" is - the concept of 50 unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that you can't get bored, or something else entirely...
Another unusual idea is the change of car during the race.
You must not overlook the gas stations along the way, because this is where you can change cars, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the mountain serpents.
Hand in hand with the story mode of the game is the task mode (challenges) - the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points to win for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To get to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked, starting with the car, to the background for the profile.
This is also linked to the online Autolog function, which compares the results of the player with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
Another of the most incomprehensible sculptures is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you drive into a subway tunnel (for me) where you race along the tracks in the dark (for me).
The speedometer shows a figure of 150 to 200 km/h (for me), but then suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives you to scrap.
I think we're gonna be in the newsroom arguing for a long time about whether this was a game developer blackout or whether the writers think we're so stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming, but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
What's even more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the replay rate slows down, and sometimes quite dramatically.
This is particularly true of accidents involving a large number of persons, where continuous FPS is of no use.
The sound reproduction is fine as far as I'm concerned, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as broad a scale as possible to a younger audience, a soundtrack was created a lá "something from everyone" - but who buys such a game for the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is a little mixed.
If the game hadn't been diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have argued with the crest of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But it makes the game look kind of unfinished.
It's a great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared for these mistakes to stick in your eyes with the power of airport lights.

The EU has a very strong position on the issue.
The Czech Republic has a reputation for being a negative and Eurosceptic country.
'The Treaty of Lisbon has brought about a marked change in the balance between the various institutions.'
I did not expect such a hard war to break out".
"It will take five or six years for the waves to settle down and everyone to get used to their new role", Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
The importance of the motto 'Comprehensible and open about Europe' was shown in the first part of her talk, in which she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their interrelationships in such a clear and understandable way that she could have envied many lecturers at the Faculty of Law at Charles University.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was that he was too inconspicuous - a gray-haired official who was not fit for such a role, but I must say that it took everyone by surprise how well he took the matter up.
'He is a man who is able to listen patiently to 27 Member States, communicate with them and above all have clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was then described as an answer to the question: 'Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?', i.e. an important step towards unification and better legibility of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil caps
Mrs Vicenová also spoke about the agenda on which the European Union has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czech Republic has overcome the financial and gas crises and has also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The fall of the government during the presidency was a major negative which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
The Ambassador said that not only the Presidency but also the crisis that followed, which has not been overcome to date, was a rather hectic affair.
And then there is the seven-year EU budget, which is much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
The question of whether the budget should be slim and sparing, which sectors should be given priority, which countries should receive more and which less aid - all these are now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans when she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's horrible acronyms, foreign words, and jargon that no one understands.
How am I to know as a citizen whether Brussels is really making up curved or round cucumbers and banana of different sizes or whether someone is really trying to ban the Quargel?
She would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or more speeds in view
The EU ambassador said the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who see more the negative than the positive.
The Czech Republic is the only country in the European Union to have a representative vote in the European Parliament.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you two up to - is that your V4 again?' and make a rather sour face.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the new rules to the Member States.
The Commission's proposal is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which is the basis for the European Union's economic and monetary union.
"We have the countries in the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
'We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation.'
"It was first said that only those countries that want to work together should do so and those that do not should stand quietly by the side".
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately result in a strong 'Europe of different speeds,'" Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the euro-zone countries.
Brand story:
The innovator IBM enters its second century of existence
If you were to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM's strategy, it would be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, known as a modern company, even though it has been a century since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by its first chief, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He already had the slogan that countless world problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became the trademark around which the life of the future giant was to unfold (and at the same time the title of the company's magazine, which began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
This was also the basis for the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business, and society, over the course of our first century.
We hope to do more in the next hundred years", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director, on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson was already providing social care for its employees in the 1930s - in a similar way to entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: as one of the first American employees, IBM employees had paid holidays, insurance from the entrepreneur, plus elegant uniforms as work clothes, and a well-thought-out system of remuneration for the best innovators and dealers.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in its talent promotion from the start - when IBM was one of the first companies in the world to abolish discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to replace Palmisan at the helm of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for 30 years, previously holding the position of Head of Operations, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing what's called online brainstorming for the past few years, which has led to many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
A reputable institution
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company", said Harvard Business School professor and IBM book author Rosabeth Moss Kanter to Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology", added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasises, there is a difference between merely being present on the market and directly shaping it through that presence.
IBM -- known in the States as "Big Blue" for its familiar logo -- has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It's one of the most versatile technology companies ever -- IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services across an incredible range of products -- from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes, and the floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of about $220 billion, IBM was the second largest technology company in the world this year, surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations were to the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the experiment with the company's own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the IBM PC jr.
"Business is about moving forward, so you can't get emotionally attached to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundation on different platforms - and if they don't work, they leave again.
Unlike its competitor Microsoft, which is basically up and down with its Windows operating system.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of the
Services account for the largest part of IBM's profits, with software and hardware accounting for one fifth each.
In 1990, hardware was the most represented with a share of over 50%.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, but in the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
IBM continued to invest in these products after 2008, when the modern financial crisis first swept the world like a storm.
Here again, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM is surviving the current crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares has skyrocketed by 120 percent since 2008, and the company's net income is continuously growing.
The corporate slogan of IBM is: everything can change - only the values cannot.
This is another reason why it is to be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: from cheese-cutter to space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York City a hundred years ago, had a rather complicated name at first - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924 - originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous punch-card clock, which records the beginning and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the supervisory board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader then even overshadowed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are the basis of the company's invincible culture and identity to this day.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for the trade -- from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades of Watson's tenure, he doubled sales to $9 million, and the company gradually expanded to every continent.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only to be succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960's, IBM engineers and computers helped guide NASA's space flights to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 the famous manned flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard of the time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 .
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered fully into the consulting and value-added services business.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of "Smart Planet".
It is the intention to use technology in a smart way in areas not even planned, for example to improve the situation in transport and in urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the 'Smarter Commerce' platform, which is designed to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932 IBM established a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague, and it also has a world-class research team working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you can keep this donkey. I don't want it anymore.
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - this is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became her lover from Iveta Bartošová's protector (45), Darina still had hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now, finally, the patience is over and she has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner", explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová gave refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably never dreamed what would happen to her husband.
When Iveta insisted that after 30 days she return to Říčany, Josef immediately went with her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed his love for her.
In time, Darina resigned herself, even seeming to want to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but she finally gave him up.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not be welcomed at home.
"He's the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to end his days in our home together, I won't kick him out".
"Not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties", said Mrs. Rychtářová, but she also said that she had already separated emotionally from him and insisted on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door on him, Joseph has so far borne with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing's going to change".
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that".
"The company is going on, I'm doing the repairs, the garden, the land, I'm doing the shopping".
"I talk to Darina as a normal person, but we don't share a bed", said J. Rychtář (the newspaper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female vices, what about you?
When men are asked to name some typical female vices, they invariably shake some out of their sleeves.
Ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where we review a few mishaps that make the men's blood run in their veins?
Shopping addiction
Does your husband accuse you of being a shopaholic?
Do you have to buy at least one hater a week?
Do you like to shop and can you do a little more with the promotions?
Then your case is really about weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping habits under half control.
But let's face it, what woman can stand to wander through a clothing store looking for a good-fitting outfit without trying out all the colors in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often hell.
Think how many times they've told their husband to stay out of the way.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does this sound familiar to you?
- You want to?
Then you must be one of those women who are obsessed with their looks.
That's not to say you should let it go, but many men are allergic to their wives' constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more intolerable.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, and scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner for stepping on clean tiles with dirty shoes again, scold the children for having dirty sinks and for having fingerprints on the glass door of the living room closet when polishing is so difficult?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", you should know that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness in family life should not come first.
This excessive flirtation with cleanliness can also end up damaging relationships and, above all, the peace of the family.
Stinging
"Dirty gym pants go in the laundry basket".
"Do you really want to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor".
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it puts him in a bad mood.
They don't mean anything bad. They just want things to be in order.
If men knew that, women might not have to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and chat, and then they get cheated or even slandered or forged alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to go through these kinds of topics, like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
I guess every woman has a little harmless gossip in her pocket.
Hand on heart - that's what women do.
This is not to be confused with the most serious gossips, for whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and who pose a considerable danger, especially to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assists
Jaromír Jágr, a hockey goaltender, had two assists in Monday's NHL game, and was a big part of Philadelphia's 5-3 win on the ice in Carolina, making him the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The 39-year-old star's overview was used in both cases by Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was named the best player of the match.
Two assists in the same game were also recorded by Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
Jagr claimed to journalists after the game that he had predicted Giroux a big night.
"I'll tell him before the game that he's got a hat trick today".
I kind of had a feeling".
"Sometimes you get that feeling", explained Jágr, whose action led to Giroux scoring a goal on the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second hit had a "Czech trail".
Voráček won the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third was called, home run Patrick Dwyer hit a short, but the second third was then returned to the Flyers.
That's what Giroux is.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing with a hockey player like him".
"I'm very happy about this".
"I'm cutting my game on me".
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates played their games on me, and now the game is over", smiled Jagr.
Carolina made the game even more dramatic - with the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and Dwyer, who once again won a penalty, it came close to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications, succeeding in a two-on-one lead.
"Excellent Pronger still in our area".
"He caught the puck, I picked up the pace and (Read) moved to more distant posts".
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked", Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
With this victory, Philadelphia took the top spot in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and was ruled out in the second quarter due to an upper body injury.
The Candiens lost their lead to their experienced Beck by an unbeaten penalty shoot-out of 2:3.
One of the penalty shots Tomáš Plekanec could not turn.
The high level of illness-related defensive failure hurt the coach of the home team more than the lost points - they finished the game with only five defensive players.
"This is bad".
"We ended the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young players".
"But there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"At each turn, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to oppose".
"We should have made the game easier and taken the puck out of our third".
There were reserves here", said P. K. Subban, one of the defensive players.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended 30 shots from Tampa Bay, making a significant contribution to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
The Jets, who ended a five-game losing streak, had five different shooters in the field.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorised state travel agencies in the then Czechoslovak Soviet Union: Čedok, Sporttourist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies then mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, whereas in the West only selected people were allowed to travel.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia was also allowed, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the USSR, for example, wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he would need a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but then you had to buy giant snakes or sleep in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter had not gone well.
The so-called foreign exchange guarantee - the condition for traveling to the West - was granted only to people "politically reliable" - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange guarantee it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
So the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the country, and it is no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend homes and cottages - a practice that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a tourist revolution in the Czech Republic.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, which is no longer noticed, is the fact that until 1989 you could not travel to the most popular Czech holiday destination - Croatia, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange requirement was abolished in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which led to a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time, Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West, and everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in tents in the park when they went to Paris, because who would have had the money for a hotel or a boarding house back then?
A typical feature of foreign trips by Czechs at that time was a trunk full of canned goods, beer and sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech krone - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, consequently, average wages rose, which ushered in another important moment in 1997.
The increased demand for travel led to travel agencies starting to regularly prepare travel by charter flights after 1997, which made air travel incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already established currency-free payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-velvet travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - Thailand - was made thanks to high demand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been flying every year with Czech passengers to far-off sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are being flown directly from the Czech Republic.
Every year, 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitively ranked our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than CZK 15 per head on a single holiday including the costs of the holiday destination.
The general assembly is to find a new chairman - another standoff.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman, and the threat is that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the helm of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general assembly on Thursday in Nymburk.
The Commission has not yet decided on the electoral procedure.
And without it, there is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three people are interested in managing Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, having urged his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only in the post-Hashek era did the old quarrels between the two chambers of the federation break out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, when the new Chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiations had not led to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the amendments, but I am sure that the Commission will be able to accept them.
On this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which considered that representation by proxy was not feasible.
The dispute over the electoral system continues, however.
The Commission has also been unable to clarify the matter, since the agenda of its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, is essentially nothing else.
Even though the views on the choice changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid a deadlock situation?
"The point of contention is whether to proceed in accordance with the constitution or whether a completely different model needs to be found", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR, which represents professional football in management.
The third round is held in accordance with the constitutional model, with the winner being the candidate who receives the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to compromise on the winner being the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote counting obtains at least a two-thirds majority.
"Then the two first rounds are useless at all, this mode would call into question the whole two-chamber concept", Svoboda understands the objections of the Moroccan side, which would prefer not to bend the electoral system but to vote according to the current constitution.
Tomáš Paclík surprisingly agrees, although it is clear that the constitutional electoral system is most likely to be favourable to Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is that the elections should be held as far as possible according to the constitution".
"So that no nonsensical alternatives are invented, as at the last general meeting", explained the owner of (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and who in his comments was mainly against Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
He said that the new chairman would be well known in Nymburk and that he believed that the candidates would continue to work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Championship today would certainly help to calm the spirits".
"When football is on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is greater", says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience of all three adepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for a settlement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous".
"It is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to 'bend' the rules for their own purposes".
"Therefore, a new blockage at the general meeting is not excluded".
"I hope, however, that common sense will win out", Rajchl said.
- But there is not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some of the negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete by the time of the qualifying match.
The charter plane, which was to take Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorice, among others, could not take off in Prague in the morning because of a technical malfunction, and so a feverish search was made for a replacement option to bring part of the executive committee to the place where the Barrage match was to be held.
The Council has not yet decided on the matter.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would like to bring the divided parties within the country's largest sports federation to an agreement.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment in the event of a disaster.
Paclík enters the race for the chairman's position because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner Football Association, had been able to identify a strong candidate before the Extraordinary General Assembly, who would have fulfilled all his expectations about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and forgo the election".
"But in the current situation, it has not been possible to find such an adept", Paclík told ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from rising to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that if he wins, he intends to hold the office of Chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
He would have liked to see an experienced top manager in the chairman's position, one who is not too involved in football.
"I've spoken to some of the people in question personally".
"I can't believe some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"I would like to change such views", he said.
Most of all, Paclík is said to be disturbed by Pelta's connection to the chairman of the Pilsner County Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, Paclík considers it unacceptable that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
"His victory would have preserved the present state of affairs and would have prevented Czech football from progressing at all".
"The support of Berber, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football", Paclík stressed.
He also points out that Pelta's name was linked to a corruption investigation phone call some time ago, but Pelta was acquitted.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta win should bring to football".
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclík, who is somewhat more relaxed about his earlier statement that "he will sell Pilsner Football Club when Pelta becomes chairman".
But if Paclík wins the elections on Thursday, he can imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the October general assembly, which ended in a fiasco, feels the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to".
"He has great skills".
"I could well imagine him as the head of the national team, for example".
"But I don't think he's capable of running the union as a manager".
"I don't stick my nose in things I don't understand", said Paclík, who caused a stir in September by calling off the refereeing committee with Luďěk Macela at the helm, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels fit to be the president of the association.
And, citing his skills in running private companies, since last summer he has also been the boss of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated its first league triumph in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it".
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which results in disgusting situations", said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan chief Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities was to strengthen relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby top politicians to get more money from the lottery tax into sports.
"That's one of the crucial things the new chairman should be focused on".
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they must also say clearly and clearly where the money goes", he said.
Paclík also does not see his association with the Pilsner Club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is also associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"This is not ideal".
"It also makes little sense to me to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party and then return after a year and a half", Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR which would rule out a future crisis.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would push for the FAČR to get new statutes that would rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday's hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely ease off with a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that if elected he would focus on the national team and raising funds.
He decided at the last minute to participate in the election before the last general assembly and thus the two-month break was intended to help him defend his ideas on the management of football and present them in a wider context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be announced on Thursday".
"He feels it is high time that the association is led by someone", says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer Club but who also acted for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
He also believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria of Ivan Hašek's time is responsible for the current problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, the June general assembly approved statutes that were not as complete as everyone had agreed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman by September,' said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association as a lure for the delegates.
"If I am to become chairman, I will take personal responsibility and be prepared to take personal responsibility if it does not work out".
"This is a fundamental thing that he cannot do without", Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponent.
He had already announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal training and knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík, who had not been attacking Pelta for a long time, was also not attacking him.
He has been in football for over a year and has already achieved some success".
"However, his attacks were demeaning and many people were shocked by his campaign".
"This is also why many people are now doubting his true character", Pelta told his opponent, who is likely to remain true to his proclamations made in September.
He believes his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower grades to the national team.
And this was supposed to be the emblem of Czech football.
"I would also endeavour to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately start negotiations with the private and public sectors to secure sufficient funding for the whole of football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top tier of Czech football would not mean personnel purges.
"I should first of all familiarize myself with the work content of all the employees", he said in the direction of Strahov, where nervousness is understandably present because of the long anarchy.
Despite the uncertain catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not be going to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
"If the only contentious issue is how to vote in the third round, we'll get over it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only regain it when it finally has a new leader", Pelta said, remaining optimistic two days before what could be the decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly make many people in the association feel bad.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, you will start working hard.
He wants to introduce systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole".
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, to professional football, to youth football".
"I don't mean to say that I want to do everything alone", Rajchl told ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore I would like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area".
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that football progresses in every segment with milestones".
Many would not be thrilled about this because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves", he added.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to accept the proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who are not constantly throwing sticks between my legs and questioning every step I take", he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me not to give up because others would do the same".
"That's trust you can't gamble with", he said.
He is also said to be motivated by the fact that he is allowed to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"We have done a great deal of work in two years, and I don't want to throw it away".
"Trials have been launched that will probably only come to fruition in a few years and I would not like to see them stopped", he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - is elected, the situation could return to pre-Hashek times.
"I believe in systematic approaches, and that is something Mirek Pelta does not bring".
"Behind him are people who would make football a game for the chosen".
I may be accused of many things, but not of being partial".
"I try to be objective".
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is happy and not just the chosen few", Rajchl remarked.
He also denies that he is only a leader of the Czechs.
"Although some people claim otherwise, I really intend to do the best I can for the Moro".
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian section, the winners of which would then be promoted to the first league".
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Moravia", says Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsner Club, Tomáš Paclík, has now joined the fight for the chairman's position, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and now recognizes that I have clear successes behind me", said Rajchl, who also considers saving tens of millions of kroner on unfavourable contracts, agreeing television contracts and negotiating the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association is not pulling on a single thread.
While he says of Pelta that "it is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football regain confidence", he considers the second rival - Paclík - a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year".
'If elected, he would probably continue the work Ivan Hašek has started and obviously he would not change the staffing of the commissions in principle.'
He would not want to bend things in his favor", Rajchl says of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschpools with UFO optics, showpools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where water wellness is best.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, one thing she could not miss in her luggage: her swimsuit.
She looked up at the elaborate domes, swam toward the marble pools that were waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the carefully restored youth-style swimming pools.
If she liked a bathroom, she would write it down in her notebook - along with interesting details about the building's architecture and history.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by architectural historian Meder - and she now presents them in her book "Badefreuden" which has just been published: swimming pools in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
She has travelled through 13 countries on her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
She's not much for sports, Meder says - only in the water.
The only annoying thing is that swimming fans have to put up with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while joggers can breathe the enchanting scent of fir forests or listen to the cheerful bird whisper in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools have to be so ugly", says the Vienna-based Meder.
So I started collecting beautiful baths.
Water surface doubled architecture
Suddenly in the swimming pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have put in the effort, swimming pools can be a real treat: "In places with floors, you have a surface".
"It is transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other".
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, bouncing boards.
The small-format booklet "Badefreuden" contains 190 pages of information on the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oases - but above all it makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an ancient karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
In contrast, many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the Zurich rooftop pool offers a view of the entire city, the outdoor pool of a pool in St. Anton offers a view of the snow-capped Arlberg - and: The steam pool has a window from which you can watch the activity on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it vaporizes from three open shells, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every pool collector's nose got the smell of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, and the Árpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells of heating oil so strongly that you can hardly believe you've landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline hydrocarbon water, which is almost black and its glue sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special kind of wellness experience.
However, one place where Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots was the Czech town of Bad Luhatschowitz, where she was planning to visit the outdoor and sunbathing area.
The bath, designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, has since been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing among the tiles.
The decay has been counteracted by a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
The bath has already completed three phases of construction; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because it originated in the Black Forest.
"It's a feat to combine so many different styles into one great piece", says Meder.
In such a palace, the thermal pool is obviously only a secondary consideration.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank examines its commodities business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO will want to draw consequences.
- The European Parliament
The German people are clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of those questioned even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of the business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives up prices - and that banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer protectionists is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank head Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have disconnected themselves from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike his US rivals, Ackermann responded to criticism by promising to investigate the allegations and saying that no deal was "worth jeopardizing the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations in the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank's board of directors - with recommendations on how to deal with it.
The Bank's management will then announce its decision at the end of January.
The end result could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even a complete turnaround.
Ackermann is tinkering with his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news but reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices is a particularly dramatic demonstration of how ruthlessly banks are now harming the public good".
Ackermann is now particularly obliged as the bank's chief lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments that use money to bet on food prices", Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann's hunger-stricken people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not be moving to the supervisory board, contrary to plans.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - after all, that's what his successor would have to do.
One in two would quit raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of employment.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, terminate all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they were considering closing their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with highs, lows and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and decayed.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition hall.
If the scene is full of modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials, typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzers Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so known that he also built a pavilion at the next World Exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a bullet-like side-build in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the World's Fair in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - it was called the "20th House".
The building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new home.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and coming down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21st House" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens its first exhibition - a lucky event in every respect.
The new beginning was set in motion by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, who had a distinguished career as an art historian, including a career as a young artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, insisted on the rebuilding of the building with politicians and conservationists, and obtained public and private sponsorship funds and fixed the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore were to be built, and an office building was to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal cast.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he had studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
The current renovation was far more problematic: The building was "an energy waste", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, fibreglass reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold-bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two lower floors made room for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light swans pavilion.
The original exterior doors are still there, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown rust-proof tint.
And the theater is still exactly as it was.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Monuments Authority and on a small budget.
"Often you had to find a material that was good and cheap and that the conservation office liked", says Krischanitz, pointing to a rusty floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet "seeks to awaken the right consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, for an urban development event has occurred: around the Swiss garden is being built the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings.
And another lucky event may come: the 21st house could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and it is reported that she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss Garden.
Railways plans winter crisis package worth millions
The railway has devised a contingency plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This is to ensure better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of aid to be granted to the airport.
The aim is to clear the platforms and 90 per cent of the critical sections of the railway from snow and ice within four to five hours of the start of operation.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, owing to a lack of reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railways Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it a point for years to have axles of ICE trains checked at the workshop much more often after an ICE had a breakdown at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the US
After the riot over boss Josef Ackermann, a new trouble is coming from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar fine.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now catching up with its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute is paying a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA, the financial market regulator, accuses a number of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks into buying the financial products with false promises, downplaying the risks.
Such securities lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and took the banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court", said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any guilt in the settlement.
The same goes for Citigroup, which has committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodation from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to recover billions in damages.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also sidetracked other major banks and this summer sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on home loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it was a disaster for a lot of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events took place some years ago, the banks in the United States are currently facing a storm.
Investors and regulators have filed numerous lawsuits seeking redress or punishment for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of over-rewarding the two state-owned U.S. mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions totalling some $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from the FHFA, involving several transactions totalling $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The Authority requires the Frankfurtis to account for 'substantial losses', without however specifying an exact amount.
The German bank had rejected the claims as worthless and declared that it intended to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is joining IBM with $10 billion
Financial mogul Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought up more than ten billion dollars' worth of stock.
The great American investor Warren Buffett had always said that he would not invest in IT and computer companies because the long-term development of these companies is poorly predictable.
But now he's read the IBM financial statements and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily a service provider and that it was buying computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a coup de grace in the financial world.
As a result, the IT pioneer IBM is now entitled to call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett just revealed on CNBC that he's bought IBM stock worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew anything about the engagement until now.
He praised the management, which had made decent profits even during the economic crisis.
"They did a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been investing in lucrative IT services such as data centre operations for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting services as well as powerful corporate computers.
Buffett had been avoiding tech companies until then.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett went to a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer, or a mechanical engineer.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to some 80 of its own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of large companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with smart investments, had grown it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money has earned him the nickname "Oracles of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment went public, IBM stock went up one percent in the pre-sale period.
Big Blue, also known as IBM, is worth more than $220 billion in the stock market, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to get into it.
He's a close friend of Bill Gates.
The Threat is Tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell", the Turkish media are doubting the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" now resurging.
The murders of eight people of Turkish origin and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being reacted to with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, this is a return to a ghost long thought dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
There was never any question that there was xenophobia in Germany.
The discovery of the right-wing extremist network, however, reveals a scale that is far from predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with caution: it held a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend to commemorate the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had been thinking together with German and Turkish politicians in a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish contracting agreement.
The two had been staged together in happy colors - as a success story.
The Turkish media's coverage of the massacre is a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the 50th" is the headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform Haber X, which discusses the background of the serial murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" is also unable to avoid drawing this mental connection.
"It's starting to smell", is the headline of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people were murdered, who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The German-Turkish Internet forums are extremely critical of the police's actions and their subsequent success in searching.
The authors wonder why the German authorities had not thought much earlier of searching for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some are willing to resort to drastic measures, at least rhetorically: 'If we continue to be sloppy here, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and arming.'
"I think that's the best way to protect yourself".
"The quality of the investigation and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network is very much dependent on the internal peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace of Germany is in danger was made clear by the attacks on Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen fire is deeply ingrained in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, intensified the feeling of "we" on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time criticized the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then listed in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It's like a man's worth is determined by his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deeply distrusted many German Turks have been of the rule of law there since then.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the situation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time we need to speak out.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German will be the judge.
I'm sure that's not how Axel Weber thought it.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and made friendly remarks about his future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But it was clear in September that things would be very different.
A dealer of UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's collateral systems and embezzled some 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, chairman of UBS, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the UBS board of directors has also been considered a loser since then - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be advising the Bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not just in 2013, the bank said Tuesday.
This is gonna be hard on Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a central banker, and he would certainly have needed some time to get used to it.
In one fell swoop, he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
Because UBS is huge -- until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world -- and it's been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is left to the once-proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of a quiet and solid but also well-to-do Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big figure in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world, at $1.6 trillion.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Former banker and later longtime professor of banking in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank".
"In today's world, you ask, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was seriously wrong at UBS.
In mid-year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who had been regarded as a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker, resigned unexpectedly.
A few months later, it was discovered why he had left.
The investment arm of the bank had been plagued by subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To meet this, UBS announced a capital increase of, say, 13 billion francs.
She did find investors for this, but some of whom had been sneering until recently: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that you didn't even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, and its chairman, Marcel Ospel, who was the second-highest paid member of the Swiss board in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be bailed out by the State.
The National Bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced conversion bond, which allowed it to become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - for it realized how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks.
Finally, UBS' balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save UBS", says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Within months, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have been using the bank to evade taxes.
She also agreed to pay $780 million in unjustified profits from those deals, plus a penalty increase.
In this way, UBS more or less openly admitted to having helped to avoid tax.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
The Chairman of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors resigned.
And the exodus of client funds.
In the course of a few months, the Bank had lost credibility in both of its core business areas: investment banking through mis-speculation and asset management through aid for tax evasion.
And just when things were getting a little bit quieter, just when you thought UBS was going to get it right, this is the unfortunate dealership story: One single dealer is sucking up 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes something is wrong.
And it turns out, the risk management in investment banking is still clearly not working.
"The Adoboli case has shown that risk control has not changed enough", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
Even the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over risk".
It was precisely the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers had long ago set out to become custodians of the world's great wealth: no too great risks, but security for the money - should the world collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the thriving Swiss private bank - it's just a little bit bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rent is among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here among traditional Swiss shops like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here, from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-covered, and in front of them are thick leather armchairs, and next to the bank logo is a large sign indicating the "safe".
UBS knows what the client here is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank was eventually dismissed by both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does business with the two big banks, like all Swiss bankers.
He said that UBS had become too big, especially in investment banking, where the anchor banks had also expanded.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And if they did, they'd have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons long ago".
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, first bringing it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"That Wednesday, the coalition government of the tiny country of seven million decided on the largest rescue in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were allocated by the politicians to rescue the big bank from bankruptcy.
How did this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
The merger created a bank that was already too big for the small Switzerland - and it kept growing.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a wealthy but dormant bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the international investment bankers had a lot of money at a reasonable price to turn a giant wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly-man who worked his way up from banking to the top".
But Ospel ended up relying on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, perhaps.
The truth is, pride came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: "Destroy Goldman Sachs".
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She cited the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of banks at the time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, to the top.
She had already made some steps.
She was at the top of the foreign exchange and stock markets.
However, consultants in the business sector pointed out one weakness: in the international interest rate business, in banking parlance, there is a huge gap between the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund it had set up before it invested in U.S. subprime assets.
It became a giant machine that packed and delivered securities on American mortgages, but it also took risks.
Even when other banks were looking to get out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there", says banking expert Geiger.
The euphoria is the depth of the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than expected.
Postings at UBS became a flop and are still shaky today.
Whoever's running the big bank now has a job that's almost impossible.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all its obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger has an idea: stop with investment banking, focus on wealth management, return to your Swiss roots.
The Bank does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, that much is clear now.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was originally intended only as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly split from its predecessor Grübel.
He has now established himself as the permanent head of UBS, Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the mid-1990s.
He's going to cut 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What's she doing to make money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
He has only said publicly that he and his wife are going to look for an apartment in Zurich.
I'll see you next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock markets
The impending recession in Europe has discouraged US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome was not effective.
The collapse of industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis.
The general relief through the change of government in Rome and Athens was not successful.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses were half-full, not half-empty, last week, but now the problems are again coming to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
The sales notes were mostly financial.
The Dow Jones index of the standard values closed trading at a minus 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
The market barometer was between 12,027 and 12,170 points in the course of trade.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 percent and went out of business at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent on 5,985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has reduced production significantly and is preparing for the end of the recovery.
The companies produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, we are dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to recover from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only by saying that it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything it could to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
He also called for the EU to be involved in the fight against terrorism.
Instead, Buffett threw away a decades-old principle and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM helped to boost the stock price of the traditional group and initially led it to rise by just under one percent against the trend in trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 a share and now owns 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway dropped 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house is silvering almost all of its remaining shares in China Construction Bank, forcing out $6.6 billion.
The institution intends to use the net profit from the business primarily to cushion its capital ratio and thus comply with stricter regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased its losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the company had collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777s on Sunday, with the order valued at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 more machines, the volume is up to $26 billion.
At the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values increased, 2281 were lowered and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, with sales of 1.38 billion, 630 stocks closed in the upper, 1913 in the downper and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds", but experts say that the highly intelligent animals are no longer a threat to the city.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them quickly: crows have been part of the city's landscape for centuries, but in many communities residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A cure for the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Leer said that seed-crayfish are no longer to be found in the cities.
Experts from all over the Federal Republic discussed possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the migration of the specially protected seed crayfish: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing planting, and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies of more than 600 breeding pairs are found in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, and in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project to kill crows in the county had made negative headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of the animals in bird traps and the beating of them with sticks particularly brutal.
"The normal eviction, the displacement, is useless", noted urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying nests with water or cutting down trees often has unwanted consequences, said Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are escaping, large colonies are splitting up and spreading to other places".
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the Community's financial policies.
"We have to live with them, we can't get rid of them".
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of herding of animals from sensitive areas and lure offers to resettle them elsewhere is conceivable.
"Infotable instead of chainsaws", psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, promoted a completely different approach to animals: "A pimple on the face is the best way to endure it with confidence".
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where information signs inform about the life of highly intelligent seed-crayfish.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had a view on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but they even make their own tools as a means of getting it.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the intelligence of four seed-bearing crows.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to bring down a scaffold to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape of a stone needed to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the whistling crows were then asked to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with the beak.
But the researchers had laid wires on them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with which they then caught the bucket by the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in doing so at the outset.
Cristiano Ronaldo is shooting Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sold out the final tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by two-time superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected their fifth consecutive European Championship appearance after the 0-0 draw.
The Czech Republic was only 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off replay against Montenegro, after the second leg (2:0) had been a clear game.
Croatia also failed to score a point at 0-0 against Turkey, while Ireland scored a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) were the other goalscorers for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic had two shorts for Bosnia with a converted barrel (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65).
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal had a tailor-made start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to take the early lead into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later Nani showed his long-range skills and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnian, who missed the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance through goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English top-flight Manchester City put a head ball on the bottom of the plate, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek plays for the Czech Republic
The next event was the headlined by Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial barometer after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion made it clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth consecutive European Championship for the 1976 European Champion.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a scary second in the initial phase.
Petr Cech was able to prevent a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot from the penalty spot in the 40th minute, barely passing Cech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class Czech goalkeeper, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb couldn't get past a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink will almost certainly have to leave his place on the bench for the third World Cup in 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth appearance in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Sel Incukan hit the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the bouncer in the goal.
After the second scare, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Economic Community since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already secured a preliminary with a 4-0 win in the second leg, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57) was the guest.
Ireland were pushing the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible lead.
But it was in the 32nd minute.
After an accidental defence by closing man Pavel Londak, Ward was in position and pushed the ball 1-0 over the line.

SAP to double its workforce in China
Europe's largest software maker, SAP, is investing billions in China in the next few years and intends to almost double the number of its employees in that country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are to flow, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire staff accordingly", announced co-CEO Bill McDermott at a customer show in Beijing.
The number of employees is expected to increase from around 2500 to 4500.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has so far been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP's more than 176,000 customers worldwide are in the booming world.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer family had raised about 12.5 billion euros.
The software company, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is now doing almost as well as ever.
SAP has been operating in China for 20 years.
"We now want to expand our activities (...) ", explained McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education".
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book, Beauty and Horrors: A History of the First World War, Told in Nineteen Fates, begins with a long list of characters that touch your heart.
Here's a tip: Cut out this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel-like narrative, and these main characters will serve as your GPS, as a beacon in those few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book which he not unreasonably describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, no major treaties, no famous battles, no ambassadors, no raging reporters, no discussions of tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but more "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Horror" almost sums up the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad, or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the candles in a church, some adding while others go out.
Englund's book is different from the usual history books.
It also corrects the view that World War I was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
Beauty and the Beast travels with expert eyes to other war-torn places: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are getting beehives, one is celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war is flooding these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like cordite.
Imagine that you are a woman at home with her children, and you hear cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or do you run?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what's happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts", Englund notes, "were furnished with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors".
"Beauty and the Beast" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories may be frightening or moving, but they are very much alive in the englunds of the small moments that lose their focus on detail.
Many of them deal with scarcity and want.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells, "Replacement, replacement everywhere".
"Returned coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He's telling me more about the food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in hammer fat (and finally served with a false wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes soaked in wood".
He noted that there were "837 registered food substitutes permitted in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American acknowledges his own urge for savagery and says of war: "You feel that after all this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair with the evening paper or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and pretending that such a façade meant civilization and that there was no barbarism behind one's strengthened and seized shirt-chest".
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is probably going to die and no one will notice or care.
"When you dismiss the idea of self-sacrifice, you want to think that it's in front of an audience", he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret".
Other observations are of the old Europe falling apart and of new forms of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest", writes Englund, "a war between the factories".
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century": "the word-deep and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailored suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unpredictable ways, and there is as much frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get a sexually transmitted disease from a prostitute in order to escape the front.
"The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade in gonococcal pus, where soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital", he writes.
"Those who were truly desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to their remaining blind for the rest of their lives".
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive, perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed forces that were uniquely uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on the First World War were usually more distorted, like Paul Fussell's Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West, than extensive history books.
Englund's band is joining an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it away.
But it's like he took this page with the main characters from under our noses and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault.
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing emergency helmets.
The night was Monday to Tuesday, because there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, all others initially believed to be participating in an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and has given the squatters a tremendous increase in public sympathy, should not be repeated.
And so the police operation to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared for this by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had been held overlooking Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training -- counterterrorism measures that included the rapid dismissal of large numbers of police officers -- to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute", said one person familiar with the orders, which was a declaration of "exercise".
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, did not know it was Zuccotti Park", said one person who wished to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was Zuccotti Park were the department's top officials".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials tried to evacuate the park, but then backed down when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of the plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are usually deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people are in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park", he said.
Ambulance vehicles with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were standing by the Pike Slip exit and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that were sounding from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue windjackets, many protesters simply tore up their clothes and left the area.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of officers have been seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said it was for their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they were prevented from watching the police action in the park, and they said that the handling of the officers was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
As police moved westward through the great confusion of protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grass, and bags of clothes, they were followed by city cleaners who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, images of which appeared on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A main nucleus of protesters took up position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency responders were called in to cut it off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, he said, for "inappropriate behavior and resisting arrest".
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department, the highest uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Criminal Investigations Division, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not run the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to intervene, a second group of officers was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these locations, the police were seen to be expanding the perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
At one location, several officials, many with safety badges, were seen pushing people out.
Approximately 28 persons were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the southern part of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters blew out the tire of a police bus.
At one point, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
Finally, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The caregivers' union is going to sue the city for dismissals.
The union, which represents hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory because of their undue influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last chance the union, District Council 37, has left in its efforts to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two schoolchildren, care coordinators and other staff, who were among the city's worst paid employees and lost their jobs in a chess match on October 7, have described the union leader as political revenge for denying the city access to a health fund maintained by the task forces last year to close the budget gap.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, the school superintendent, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A city councilman shot back and explained that nothing in the budget specified that school relief workers would be laid off.
Officials at City Council 37 said they had and warned the Department of Education of a lawsuit, and there will be a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are women of color or Latino, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Justice Department, said the city was not suing and could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by the New York Times, the union focused on the number of school layoffs in the city's poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit over inequality, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the Upper East Side schools or TriBeCa, 17 school helpers in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn lost jobs and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were laid off.
Noting the loss of five of eight schoolchildren employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of distraught parents who can organize donations to cover budget cuts".
P.S. The 36th District's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and there was a loss of money when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo approving the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" in the US usually describes the shift of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the head office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred", the draft complaint states.
Mission complete, Congress ready to agree on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already in agreement on the Libyan uprising.
All it took was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution, chaired by John Kerry (Massachusetts) and Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun the rebuilding of their country", Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties".
The language may sound innocent, but nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House were in dispute over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproved of the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
But that same day, this bill passed the Senate, and the House also passed a resolution to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
This put the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purge -- with a Congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama's actions on the mission, but not angry enough to finally tear the ground from under him.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in Libya's successful and irrevocable transition to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Committee or will they divide the legislature, as the June law did?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican on the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it's up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term for Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently on the floor of the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to get their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatt's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a whole range of issues.
Some are two-fold - the same law has been introduced in both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially those new to Republican politics who want to polish their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit on two terms of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that include guarantees for the right to good education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is just as much an amendment prohibiting burning flags as it is a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow for the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
The more eager the members are to propose changes, the more rapidly they move than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments. In the 110th Congress, 66.
The pace pales in comparison with the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Find, but not defeated", Giffords said in his first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after a gunman shot her at close range during a Tucson election rally, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night singing solo to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow", saying her desire to recover was greater than her desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer on ABC News' "20/20", she was struggling to find words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage inflicted by the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and cut her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to Congress to cast her triumphant vote for the debt-brake.
In her first television interview after the January bombing, which killed six people and injured 13, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gifford, 41, replied, "Very well".
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded just before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
Special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the Jan. 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in a hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords is in a wheelchair, while therapists teach her how to perform simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A twitch of the lips.
And then, her first words: "What".
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played a major role in Giffords' recovery, as the congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Giffords a newspaper article about the assassination on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, is in a Missouri prison and under mandatory medical treatment while awaiting trial.
"Many people have died", Giffords Sawyer told me.
"Hard, hard, hard. " I was like,
During his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer recalled, she said, "I was hit".
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated'?" said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you're gonna get through this and you're gonna recover and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At one stroke, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were brought in like orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are being overwhelmed with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise comes at a price, officials say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if they were hurting people in uniform.
"We were not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be deployed to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support them is to squeeze ourselves into the role of unhappy souls".
This is a sensitive issue for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger against the returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, there are silent and private conversations about compassion among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned her that people outside the military world might see her service from two different perspectives.
Some would look upon them with a sense of awe, having defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was a "angered, violent veteran hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-ranking position in Washington.
While searching for work, he said, he sensed that some of the interviewees were subtly asking if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington just after returning from the war.
"When you talk about your ministry, you must avoid negative impressions", Cancian told his sons.
The lack of ease in the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest Americans have in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little military experience and sees little use in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common during World War II", said Lieutenant General David Barno, a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a civil servant.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a crucial hearing is scheduled to decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape case before a military court.
If that doesn't happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Lieutenant Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008, and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend, when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could take her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off", Lyman said.
But the Texan put her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut".
Minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came up behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admissible in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address the widespread rape within the military and violated the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, initially had 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict or provide adequate legal remedies for the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following up on the top military leadership, since that's where the problem starts.
"The military is hierarchical", she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that she's contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, they will file many more lawsuits if necessary to keep the pressure up.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court filings, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the military.
Under a Supreme Court law of 1950, known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers on active duty.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service", the document states.
The Department of Defense has declined to comment on the story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in connecting with local women in war zones.
The result: Between these two wars, 150 women soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time to modernize the military, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her fight: three other lawsuits are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
In addition, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the "personality disorder" diagnosis given to rape victims to dismiss them from the service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits claims for people who reported having been sexually abused in the service.
Nine bills were independently introduced to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties, who provide a range of clues.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and the Pentagon's own estimate is that this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, released in March, also examines the prosecution rate: 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military went to trial in 2010, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumatic events.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a number of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She had a rape kit, and her attacker's blood, from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was questioned by a judge, and during that hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was going into labor, so I ran screaming out of the courtroom".
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember coming out again, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure.'
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed her with a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, so she does not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs will go ahead is speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he observes: "In my opinion, they should make progress".
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first challenged.
I've been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is lagging a decade behind because they don't have the same incentive and deterrence that accountability brings.
He adds: "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go her way, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are implemented", she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who posted their anti-immigration views online.
Breivik, who confessed to a July massacre in Norway that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court on Monday.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much of the time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on digital populism in Europe by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's concealment of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extremist groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to a survey asking about their educational level, their attitude toward violence, and their own assessment of their future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave their offices.
"It's a fairly new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising: online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more rational, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens".
Demo's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas makers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends like likes, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title increase by almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through it that you wouldn't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"When you used to try to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access", says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, you lose all that -- you go straight to them".
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge drinking on Facebook were significantly more likely to have problem drinking than students who kept quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that peers, such as housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it", said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Morenos and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not otherwise have been found".
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (which primarily uses data only Facebook has access to - champions of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its big data mine available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want to or not, and in order to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to provide your personal data.
But what if Facebook users were to be part of a survey they didn't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines for how they collect their data offline, online everything is allowed.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be studying their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was all about her and her friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of what is said in a user profile and in posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things", says Selwyn.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn still thinks that a clipboard and a pen are the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research has to be about social -- and a lot of social life is still happening offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a knight of the Norwegian temple", he told a courtroom of more than 500 people.
"I object to the court's decision because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I recognize the law, but I don't plead guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, saying that he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views".
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech, permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims' relatives attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he was behind bars.
Everyone participated with the goal of making a pathway.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman", a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it's a bit more after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like the fact that the July 22 attacks seem to have been the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But does that automatically alleviate the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't", said the relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did".
7 lessons from the late Steve Jobs interview that was shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technological genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most enlightening in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off this week before special screenings in key markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-styled hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who made diagrams with a zeal - a man who believed that many CEOs suffered from "a disease of the mind", "that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there's an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the rise of the personal computer, and he sat with Jobs for over an hour, in one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time, it had been 10 years since Jobs had been kicked out of Apple, and he was already hard at work on his new computer company, NeXT, and looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in "Specialists", he says the copy templates of the interview were missing on delivery.
It wasn't until after Job's death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the principal's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which is coming to Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to detest in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Four times during the interview, there are longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, during which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Job's perfectionism comes to light, when he seems impatient to respond to Cringley's questions, prompting him to move more quickly on issues or side-stories of greater importance.
Taken before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems a bit far-sighted, when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right or wrong in his opinion and his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs' career, but to see Jobs here as the ambitious dreamer on the verge of greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences from the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"All these years in business, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done.'
Nobody knows why they do what they do. Nobody in business really thinks things through.
I've noticed that.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Impressed by the way costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs" which were calculated on a guessing basis and then adjusted by "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
As the Pope was vilified:
Jobs tells us about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that you could use to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Job's enthusiasm in describing the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is infectious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while they sifted through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff half a dozen times around the world, and if you'd just run it into the phone, it would come out in the next phone a minute later", Jobs said with a chuckle.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that could control this huge thing, and that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think there would be an Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank that he and Wozniak almost pulled off when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box to talk to the Pope while they were doing their best to emulate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, they had to laugh before the pope himself answered the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees".
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a little screen with a brown tube, and I fell in love with it.
I would climb up to HP as a teenager and hang on to that machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was assembling some boards, he was asked by a client to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some very strong arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer".
And 90 days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for 15 dollars, which was incredibly believable.
About the big companies that are falling behind.
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants would stumble with their visions and lose control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the people] who ultimately run the companies and the product, who push people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products versus bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, you could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
You've taken defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows".
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to do votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and put them all together...
Ultimately it's all about taste, it's all about trying to sort of take the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring those things together into what you make.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been for the computer industry, they would have done fantastic things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas are teaming up with health care law opponents as the court takes the case
On the day that the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will represent the case in court.
The incident occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met for a hearing to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases to be considered was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing, and in fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic debate is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the law is overturned will probably be Paul Clement, former attorney general under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that is challenging the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the trial.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case at a Washington hotel.
The report also highlights the need to ensure that the EU's health and safety standards are respected.
The guests for dinner?
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And that's not against any moral code.
In effect, judges are free from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Rule 4c of the Code, which states: 'A judge may attend charity events held under the law and other organisations, but the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honour or, according to the programme, a guest of such events.'
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alarm moral and government activists.
"This staggering breach of morality and the code punishes the prosecution of some judges by lying, and the court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights organization in the United States.
"Judges won and dined at a benefit with lawyers with pending court cases".
Your appearance and your support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they mix the legal issue too easily with agenda-driven groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist.
The Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the attorney general under the Obama administration when the first first-instance lawsuits came to court.
Her critics pressed Kagan to withdraw herself from the hearing of the case because of bias, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any effort to do this.
Boeing pulls a record $18 trillion order to shore
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777s with an option for 20 more.
In addition, Boeing is selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It's really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 planes combined is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing goldmine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order for commercial aircraft ever, measured by order value, at the weekend: 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The order for the hammer came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also announced at the Dubai Airshow in 2011 that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel economy and passenger comfort, according to Boeing.
The list price for six of these planes is over a billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, a stock market analyst at Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines, because that's one of their biggest costs, is not so bad, because the country earns from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or postpone flight orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural hedge", he said.
The order from Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership in the wide-body market and helps to keep Airbus' competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the A350's dominance.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would delay the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to build confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares are up 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president 's sister appears to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer's opponents supported Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governor's race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon, who apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state election, claimed Monday that drug dealers had manipulated the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governorship of the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our poll workers ... they occupied polling booths, they set up roadblocks ... and they hired people to vote [for the PRI]".
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a comeback, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Claderon only narrowly, who had been leading in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, who is still the governor, came in third, a heavy defeat for the divided and unhappy left-wing leadership in the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies any ties to drug traffickers and is pushing the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during a campaign for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates have pulled out of local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory will give us courage to look forward to next year".
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to help rescue the eurozone from its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking "passionlessly" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that Asia's financial support to European leadership and European resources would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful", he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune".
"So if China and India can help, then by all means".
The European Monetary Union has been in a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rates have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe has fuelled fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any assistance to Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone as its economy is now suffering from falling exports and drying out of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth".
"It is not an option, it is a task, because where else are we going to find work for our millions of young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no incentive to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion people in India, of whom more than 800 million live on 2 dollars or less a day.
"They're going to find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go on vacation on the beach, and then you have a problem", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's many well-paid civil servants in the public service, with jobs in poorly run, loss-making institutions such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone would have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The ADB's forecast of 7.5% growth in Asia in 2011 now threatens "the risk of graduation" due to the looming threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital outflow, in their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible defence cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would imperceptibly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war theaters in Afghanistan and the civilian circuits.
The Pentagon is already considering $450 trillion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress fails to reach a final spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said that a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which would lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% overall cuts and the halt of numerous new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless manner, would make most of our shipbuilding projects unfeasible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to disengage involuntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel, and since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians on leave with a limited probability of safety in order to achieve the goal".
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our alertness".
The cuts will ultimately affect the combat troops", said Panetta.
"While wartime counterterrorism quotas are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference with the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort", Panetta warned.
"Human resources were being cut, which would lead to delays in the hiring and hiring oversight that supports the war".
"Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and disrupting legal and political support".
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of seizing the Department of Defense would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be forced upon us".
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to continue".
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure for a compromise on the budget or intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, despite having many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he's facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might be coming - a military with a shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without ammunition".
"It's an Air Force squadron without adequately trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of completing the mission", Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force lacking in morale and alertness and unable to cope with potential adversaries".
"It really makes you angry".
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provided new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious limitations on our global deployment and intervention capability, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stages.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it's an important next step in upgrading so that potential threats from China and other adversaries can be contained.
How to Discover a Lie
A glance at the current headlines reveals how alarming and widespread deception and lying are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with allegations of sexual harassment by several women, both of whom accuse each other of lying.
The Penn State administration is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was used to overhear French President Nicolas Sarkozy telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself by circulating denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has lived through it will forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked when he lied in the Oval Office during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating at school and college are common.
There have been instances where teachers have given their students the test answers so that they themselves would get good marks on their tests.
Mentors who are supposed to teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception are we experiencing?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
But many of these lies are considered to be necessity lies.
Another study found that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Lying is an important skill for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game, such as charades, where the aim is to shout "Have you!" the cultivation of deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't stutter, stutter, blush and stutter all the time.
But this does not mean that these liars are difficult to detect and disguise.
A trained lie detector can penetrate the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the subtle facial expressions, the question mark and the timing.
I've spent several years studying the scientific results of the vast and ever-expanding field of disguise, and it's clear that disguise is a modern skill that's easy to learn and helps us to find our way in our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing is one of our professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at judging other people, at arousing their interest, at controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Research shows that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men are more likely to tell "self-centered" lies than women, that men lie more "for others" - usually to protect their feelings - that married people lie less than single people (but the lies they tell are usually "big lies").
We also know that when a person is exposed as a criminal, others feel less guilty for lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the quality of your subject's voice.
You should know better when someone is usually tripping all the time so that you don't falsely accuse them of tripping during a meeting.
Then watch for accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these piles as alarm bells ringing, not evidence of a cover-up.
People who cheat may become numb as they try to remember their story, may point their feet toward the door or lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "post-interview relaxation", that deep, relaxed exhalation and shift in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often mistakenly signal that a job interview is over, only to look for the job interview after that relaxation.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slip is famous for using the past tense to claim his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive persons may also use language that distances them, such as "I did not have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky", or repeating a tricky question in its entirety.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience".
This makes the answer perceptive rather than objective, often setting off alarm bells.
There is no magic cure for disguising lies, but you can learn skills that make disguising possible.
These skills make it easier for anyone to avoid being a victim of fraud, both in their personal and professional lives.
Controversial oil pipeline plan is being revised after delayed US approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering the unions and reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-planned the project so that things can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will divert the proposed pipeline from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This followed an announcement last week from the State Department that a decision on federal approval for the project would be delayed until the new potential course, which avoids the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply, is reviewed.
"This is a real step forward", Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a matter for the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1,700 mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, the pipeline would have to go through six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but labor markets love it, because they estimate the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing the legislation to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department environmental impact study found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy source says that the department's chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a drug attack in the lobby of their Manhattan building that frightened their little girl so much that she threw up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade so frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffers from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said before the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10th of last year, when stage manager Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were about to leave for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk walked with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby of her Riverside Boulevard building.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went over to take her back on my arm", she said.
LaBelle angrily warned the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started cursing - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,' said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and dragged to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby was screaming so much, she said, that it had to throw up.
Later, the LaBelles wrote to apologize, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified amount of damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he's not charging any fees and the family plans to donate the money they get to Children's Cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior", Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher who is holding an 18-month-old baby".
Climate adversity is slowing down the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, Sinaloa saw an increase in unemployment and illegal labor, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and who has great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climate adversities, there can be no talk of growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the millions in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the public sector, causing an overall decline in economic activity of 3.6% in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical reduction in agricultural development of 31.16%, which had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report on the effects of the frost, published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially destroyed, mainly vegetable, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity until November has caused unemployment to continue to rise in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18 969 more people than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in that year is due to several factors: economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the Universidad Autónoma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment, which is due to a number of factors, including liquidity losses in the marketplace as a result of the cuts in funds due to anti-money laundering legislation passed by Congress, because it is not easy for those who are illegally accumulating dollars to make them work for themselves, to invest them or to use them for anything else", he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country to look for work abroad, particularly in the United States, has decreased, partly because of the immigration problems and partly because it is difficult to find work there too.
Unpaid work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult when one considers the high proportion of black labour, which according to INEGI comprises 60.38% of the employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
The low wages of unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexican governmental agency for work and social welfare).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos as of September, which is much lower than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decline in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years, with an FDI of $630,597 from January to June, according to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Office), a decline of 87.74 percent compared with $5,143,312 in the same period the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Agency for Economic Development) for its part recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, the Land Government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to revive the economy.
Reactions
The first year of the government made it obvious to the representatives of the business community that Mario López Valdés was unable to govern.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), argued that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the ground lost this year and in 2012 we have to double down. The efforts of everyone and especially the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated", he explained.
Slow economic growth
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the economic development of the country difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the main effects is a slowing economy that is not sufficiently mobile to generate an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services.
Re-defining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Employers' Association) in Sinaloa, said that the state had to be encouraged to become more dynamic in productive activities.
"In general, we have seen that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic appeal and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa", he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would steer the government's efforts in better directions.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he explained.
He stressed that the current government had made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work to be done", he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days' probation for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of an offence against public health - in this case, possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military forces while guarding Cipriano Valdez Street opposite the 80th checkpoint in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white van, with a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack on the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the goods seized were handed over to the district judge and the convict remains in the enforcement facility.
Debt for construction work
The social structures for migrants planned under the Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed or of being delayed by lack of funds, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the municipal social development authority explained that although the construction programs have already progressed, they are now in danger because the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to for the three programs, which exceed 11 million pesos.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent went to the state.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is almost over, they haven't given us a penny, even though they should have paid us a part in July", he said. "To avoid being late, we have already started the construction work, and it is already well advanced, but we need the money".
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had failed to fulfil its obligations, and that the municipality had to borrow 7 million euros at the beginning of his term, which was the amount the central government would have had to pay.
"We had already been in this situation in the last parliamentary term because the state did not have sufficient economic resources.The programmes continued and this year we had to acquire the funds that the state had not invested to participate in these programmes", he explained.
Although the public authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding part as soon as possible.
"Nearly 12 million dollars are due, and even though the year is almost over, they haven't given us a penny".
The court approves the move to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The shift from analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which requires the shift from analogue to digital signals to be postponed from 2021 to 2015, due to the absence of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree-law detailing the switchover to digital terrestrial television.
The decision rejected the constitutional debate initiated by the Senate, which did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes to allow the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality, thus keeping the law in force.
The draft lawsuit, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree-law unconstitutional because the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulation of radio and television, and therefore the decree-law would be contrary to hierarchical principles and legal reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree-law.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, which was also the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed his disagreement with the arguments of the project, namely that the Land Government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general regulations.
"I also don't think doing that would undermine the independence of the regulatory body", she said, recalling that the central government is constitutionally responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, because it is the central government that runs state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, improved signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the switchover, she said, was a postponement of the benefits of digitisation, a decision in the public interest that had not only technical aspects, 'because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects'.
These matters, she stressed, "require the action of the whole system, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they contain a set of features which place the constitution in the hands of the central government".
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital transition, through government, despite having highly specialised institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the government is interfering with the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be observed", she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still to be counted.
The possibility of individual ballot counting is a reality in this year's elections in Michoacán, where according to data from the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still to be counted.
In this context, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9th, the Electoral Commission had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted its political constitution, its electoral law or its law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature, judging the vote of the State Ombudsman on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" as he does not have the right to "decide or veto" it.
In an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes, María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, it would now be possible for the local electoral authority to count the ballots in part or in full.
The results of the minutes are not consistent; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available on file or are not in the possession of the Chairman of the Electoral Commission or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of completed ballots may be counted if there is a difference of one percent or less between the presumed winner and the second-place candidate, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the party or coalition chairman who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after the ordinary counting, it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that this is expressly requested by a representative of the party whose candidate came second.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral minutes have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés landed on his birthplace of Saltillo on Sunday evening, followed by a funeral and mass on Monday.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the other victims of the crash, returned to the capital of Coahuila in a Mexican Air Force plane, and those closest to the colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes landed in the funeral home on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends gathered.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, and the funeral was organized by his former students from the technical high school and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio was a member of while preparing for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, as he had always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
In her view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had been at the height of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Air Force School of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people could not believe it, saying that he would be dizzy even on a truck, but he always aspired to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good man. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to attend the graduation of his family member, so he knows that his uncle died while doing what he loved best: flying an airplane.
One last goodbye
The honor was bestowed upon the Mexican Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés, under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López, by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military District, the Mexican Air Force, the school principal and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technological Education, where he studied in 1985 and excelled in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he was flying, which also carried Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a Saltillo resident, arrived to be handed over by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the front yard of the barracks, where he was already being awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned body was found on a plot of land on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media 11 people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of their bodies and in a single gunshot wound at an abandoned ranch in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The incident took place at the point of kilometre 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood barricaded wide.
When they looked inside the house, they found the bodies of three people about ten feet [3 m] further inside, which they immediately reported to the authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, wearing a white top.
Just a few feet away was the body of another person in a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three of them were lying on their stomachs.
According to the information we got from the scene, the three people must have been murdered in another location, since no shells were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions written by one organized crime gang to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defence) identified 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang, mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are linked to kidnappings, murder, halconeo (man-hunting) and secret burials.
According to the information made public, eight people were arrested and one prisoner was released on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and the arrested men confirmed they were members of the criminal group Los Zetas.
On November 12 at 06:00 am, military officers on patrol in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta found an unmarked car with two occupants.
When the military inspected the car, they found a long gun, a charger and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when he saw the military.
They're accused of secret burials at General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government is set to be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will introduce a majority technocratic cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of the government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times", the former EU commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is well-stitched now", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than usual, while Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt to unbearable levels.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European politicians to regain the lost confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to act quickly was compounded by the volatile market situation, which resulted in Italian government bonds being subject to a 10-year interest rate of 7%, which is the same as the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue aid.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Confederation of Industry, told the press after a meeting with Monti: 'We said we would support this government with all our might.'
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Montis' chances of success have been greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to produce good results", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority technocratic government that Monti is forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to its efforts or delaying reforms could bring about another devastating attack by financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also pressing for a disaster, saying that Montis's failure is a disaster.
Monti began his debate on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The round of meetings should be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would step down, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical levels due to uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
A bailout of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government would have to last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms instead of preferring elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be made up of technicians only, a sign of their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressures of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties make it difficult to involve people from political life.
Spaniards have more chances than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players recalled from Spain, ten have over 50 international matches on the horizon.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called up has played 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly match, which will be played at 3:05 p.m. today at the National Stadium in San José.
While the World and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, can look back on a considerable number of Class A qualifying matches, the three-color team has only defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
He reached this figure last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs in the English Premier League, have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) and high-level European cups such as the Champions League.
Add to this the experience of the Spanish Fury in the complicated qualifiers of the Eurocup and the World Cup.
Tico's players, on the other hand, have few international matches in the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last record: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who on Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 international games reached an equality with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain set a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a player for Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number of 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke midfielder Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol is also close to the hundred mark with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso at 91, Fernando Torres at 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both at 81, Andrés Iniesta at 62, Cesc Fábregas at 61 and David Silva at 53.
From the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are left-sided striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
The Spanish team has fewer than 30 games with Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team, less than 30 games are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of them are not even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain's all-time leading scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is preparing to play one of their best shows at National Stadium next Sunday.
They've been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures them that when they play in Costa Rica, it's a dream come true for them.
This was confirmed by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American portion of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they will make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the conversation, the full text of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica, it's a dream come true: Do you realize what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation. It's such a beautiful country that we're sure to stay there for a few more days.
We're excited to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, and they experience the days leading up to the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, so thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people even think your concert is going to be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've played a few huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they've got us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're in the mood to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle, and that's why Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surf waves?
A lot of our friends are surfers, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends used to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and together with Mexico, they're great places to surf, and that's how we learned about people who love to surf.
Looking at the tour, you've put on some huge shows with a lot of songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
We've never played there before, so we don't set any limits.
We're going to try to give the best show possible with a lot of different songs, we're going to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think part of the reason is that we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everybody likes a different song, so deciding which one we're going to play is not easy.
If we add two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked those songs.
It makes the show more interesting for us and I think it makes it more interesting for the audience.
This tour is a celebration of 20 years of your history.
Looking back, do you find it hard to believe that you've succeeded?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, and it feels like a dream.
We continue to rely on that blessing and are thrilled to be able to make music together again.
We like each other and we're passionate about making music.
We're lucky to be able to go to places in the world we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean to you to be actively involved in the birth of the Grunge?
It's always been an honor to be in this group of great bands.
We're good friends with the people at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
Occasionally a band comes out of a city, but it is not uncommon for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on tour, and we're excited to still be friends with all of them and it's an honor to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It's also very unusual for a band like yours to have been with the same musicians for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt joined us 13 years ago, which is a lot longer than most bands last.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be alive and, besides, we care about each other.
We're all close friends, which is why musical avenues have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
We know each other and their music, and we couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, thanks to your success, you've always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure we don't go on tour too much, because it's too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for music, it reminds you that you have to care about music and what it brought to life, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What are your memories of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for three years, never releasing a record until Andy [Andrew Woods] died.
We were disappointed that it took so long, and we're still good friends with Bruce [Fairweather] and Greg [Gilmore], who built the band with us, and every time I hear a song or see a picture, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, and it was always a joy to go to work, laughing together and talking about music and football and many other things.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yeah, the production team sent us videos of several bands, and we liked this one the best, so we're curious to see what Las Robertas has to offer live.
Why do you always change the lyrics to Yellow Ledbetter when you play it live?
That's a question for Ed, I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many
The first people I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge alive when it was no longer a fad?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and if they're still relevant today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever.
At first, her music was darker, but now it's more positive.
Why? Why?
That's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little light-hearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, even though they have some positive things in them.
I cried when I heard Ed play them, both of them.
I think that when you get older and something traumatic happens in your life -- like losing a family member or a friend -- it affects your artistic work and your music, and these two songs are very much a reflection of that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was taken back to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be examined for muscle loss in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations during his rule (1990-2000), has several medical conditions, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas hospital to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he thought Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, but he did not want to do so because he considered him innocent.
He had four surgeries for tongue cancer and had lost 18 pounds, plus other conditions, including severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the Directorate National of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army's death squad, which operated underground during his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss regional political issues.
Mujica is due to meet his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is a good opportunity for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the South American country's presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support over the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a tax haven list at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Mr Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which still appear to be tax havens, a statement which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialized countries, and has had an agreement with the South American country since January on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguay Round of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was held in Brussels on 15 and 16 March.
On the business side, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to the growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The moustache-wielding installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for 25 years to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to stores around the world this month, was tailored from the start to the features of the Nintende 3DS handheld console, which allows for three-dimensional play without special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses", assured Omar Álvarez, the head of the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game from Nintendo to be developed from scratch for this console", because until now, success stories like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson emphasized that although it is three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land is an "affordable" video game that allows for fast, fluid play.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less shy users.
After that, the experts can take a "second round" of the increasingly difficult game levels.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action.
This trip of Super Mario to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winked at the fans of the saga and repeated the recipe for success of the last issues: The mustachioed installer must overcome platforms dotted with dangers to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters new moves, environment, disguises, and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced on Tuesday that he would extradite former Governor Alfonso Portillo to face charges in the United States for the US$70 million money laundering conspiracy.
The trial ends with the US requesting Portillo's extradition so that he can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, taking into account that an extradition was already ordered by a court.
He stressed that during his administration he did not interfere in judicial decisions and granted all extradition requests of which he was informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is a governmental act, which takes place when all the judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to convict the former president (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his administration, a trial that preceded the extradition, but the Minister objected and re-invigorated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social assistance organisation have produced important results: during this quarter of a century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion have been helped to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than 100 jobs have been created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a review was carried out yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, unemployed, drug-related problems and at risk of marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many leaders of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association for 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different orientations during election campaigns demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and now left-green city councillor, Ricard Goma, took part in the celebrations.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and the Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work Department of the La Caixa Savings Bank, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that the present times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example of a man who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does", he explained.
Occupied house where huge parties were held was cleared
The owners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The 12 occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they had illegally occupied and where they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled", the house manager confirmed.
The occupants, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were occupied - took all the electrical equipment and part of the water supply, painted the walls, and left behind all kinds of trash, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were held, lasting up to two days, driving the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Their owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that their business had declined by 80% since the start of the occupation.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the tenants were unfairly competing, selling the drinks for three euros, whereas in the disco they cost 10 euros.
The owner of the club had also been denounced by neighbours for disturbing her sleep, while she claimed that the noise was not caused by the disco patrons but by the occupants of the house and in particular by the guests of the parties that were held there, which according to the angry neighbours had been increasing and prolonging in recent weeks.
The manager of the disco explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for the building to be evacuated immediately and for the problems of civic coexistence and the decline of the neighbourhood to be tackled.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the occupants had penetrated all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in some cases even committed theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to act against the antisocial actions in the building".
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was evacuated by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to break into the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the dispute over the fees, the architects are in agreement with the tender.
The city's tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its defamation of the funding of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in numbers to Central Park in New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park was again seen by many as the upper limit of Barcelona, since the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not extend in a north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (sea).
The designation of Collserola as a nature reserve is in keeping with this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the yogibars.
This was the case when the city launched a massive tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for additional access gates to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's planning to put gates on the land.
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for tenders is not only an organizational issue, but also a topic of discussion for all Barcelona architects, as it is a reflection on the city.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old-fashioned caste can draw on when they meet in the elevator.
And this very fact provides the material for one of the rare coincidences between what three architects in Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The call for tenders is appropriate.
Roldán said that after the attack on the coast, "it is necessary" to speak of the "front on the mountain", insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which was about the green apples, has not been delivered.
"It should be assumed that the beach is the largest park in Barcelona.
One reason is that it's easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" is a "lexical trap": one must not think of them "as entrances to a park, but as the boundaries of areas where action is required".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, who have experience in urban planning, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" which carries "some dangers".
The Commission has also been asked to examine the potential of the new technologies in the area of public transport, which are now being used in the Community.
The first fear is one's own limitation on what can be built.
"To limit something is always to set the next step", that is, to go beyond it.
"We must think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in relation to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real catastrophe".
Modol, who is more specific, says that the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by Patronat de Collserola that should not "be a surprise", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very beginning".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guiding letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("just the right thing", he says) "We architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since the tender conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 cross-sectional competitions", he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole".
At least in his case, that's what got him into the 16 contests.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a gate project would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his view, it is essential that the city guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped along its entire length in such a way as to allow a smooth transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who is released
After 72 days of silence, the attorney general of the Red Casino has released the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days in detention, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Casino Red's attorney pardoned him before the Second District Criminal Court, which is prosecuting the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration would approve the secret operation of the bookmaker.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was detained for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the official of the Ministerio Público had denied the charges of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison for allegedly bribing the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pesos, but he only stayed a few hours in the medium security detention center because of death threats.
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as a prisoner in the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was handed an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to find Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in return for opening the bookmaker.
This Monday, the attorney general of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to waive the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, an official of the Ministerio Público attached to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had repaired the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had expressed his forgiveness, but the lawyer did not name him.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted, and no further appeals against the trial can be lodged, nor is any claim for damages made.
After hearing the authorized agent of the bookmaker at about 15:50 Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transport) reported that the investigation into the accident that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others indicated that the helicopter, with its entire intact structure, crashed directly into the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings were in contact with trees at 25 meters, with the helicopter losing its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts".
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers and therefore met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that the search of the area where the plane had crashed had found no helicopter parts.
"The search did not find any aircraft parts elsewhere, the attack affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
At the moment, the priority is to get the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat of Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial was flying at cruising speed when it hit the ground and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of the collision, this was a normal flight operation".
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
The flight of sight:
In accordance with flight rules, this was a flight in accordance with the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded favorable weather conditions at the time of take-off, and as it continued toward the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, some deep hanging clouds were lifted.
Routes selected:
It is possible that the crew chose a lower area with better visibility toward the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
The impact site:
The collision coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter match, and it's possible that there was no loss of control of the aircraft or deviation from the flight path prior to the collision.
Dispersion of the aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available to date suggests that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter was struck on the ground with its structure intact.
No sign of fire or explosion.
The remains of the plane at the crash site show no evidence of fire or explosion.
The latest results of the investigation indicate several ground contacts.
The site survey found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, in a sloping terrain with an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke down.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a thorough search of an area beyond the restricted area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the unharmed aircraft structure had crashed into the ground.
MSS announces research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for childhood and adolescent obesity, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, entitled "Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity", to find the genetic markers associated with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, with a focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, and interested parties can come to the IMSS sports grounds in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out on children and adolescents every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation had started at the Cuauhtémoc sports ground (in the west of the State of México) and was continuing since 8 October at the Nezahualcóyolt sports ground (in the east of the State of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will be continued at the Independencia sports ground (in the south of the capital) and completed at the Morelos ground (in the north of the capital).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On World Diabetes Day, he said, the goal is to get 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 to complete nutrition questionnaires with their parents' consent and supervision.
They are also asked about their physical activity and family history of disease to control risk factors that may lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also explained that on those Saturdays, subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure was checked and blood levels such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study was being conducted in response to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain among young people.
"The health surveys conducted in 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of obese girls by 47 percent, and that overweight also increased dramatically", the IMSS specialist said.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican is on average 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
Generally, he explained, the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) taken in, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be a comprehensive examination of the children to determine whether they were overweight or obese.
It would even look at the occurrence of dark skin folds on the neck and forearm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and early diabetes.
All information would be kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors, who would explain to the parents all the results of the tests and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for preventing disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents blowholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico, UNAM, has developed polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather and temperature fluctuations
If the signs emanating from the pavement were taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes when the rainy season starts in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning that if the asphalt pavement is properly laid out and maintained, the number of potholes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation on "Strike Holes from a Technical Point of View" at the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to asphalt but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltene - and the other part a low one - the so-called malthene.
The asphalt's saelastic behaviour means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, is very tough at 120°C and almost solid at 50°C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes over a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations", explained the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the upper layers lies a layer of asphalt, which is made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone in this layer of wear and tear has been bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows for good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed", said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer", he explained, "a final layer is laid, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, it requires a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and must produce friction.
This pavement, which receives and distributes the most forces, also needs a suitable thickness of the supporting layer and the material from which it is made.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature variations, are other important factors to consider, especially water", he said, "because it significantly affects the wear behaviour of the layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water enters the layer and is difficult to get out of it, softening all layers of the road surface and resulting in the appearance of puncture holes.
"When a hole is made", he said, "the roof is first removed, and the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage is not immediate, but is a process that should be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs".
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican National Research System) explained that vehicle load was another important cause of puncture holes, so the thickness of each layer of road surface should always be in proportion to the vehicle load and it should be ensured that this rule is followed to avoid frequent puncture holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that much research was still to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries and which could be used to repair the puncture holes easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What did candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to win the Miss Colombia crown.
El Valle wins his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca came out empty-handed at the Miss Colombia crown.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, displaying a silver crown and the ribbon that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
The results obtained in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Departamento has already 14 miss titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown. Among the Misses proclaimed are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giral (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask themselves today is, What was missing?
The result was the downfall of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the next Miss Colombia, and who had been chosen by Vogue as Queen of the Police and Major Rostro Jolie, titles that had also been bestowed on the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who had taken home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury's decision to name her as Miss First is that she was not convinced by the answer to the question "Which book has most influenced you and why?" which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature quite a bit, I think it's a way of civilizing myself, ultimately I think the book that most influenced my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a very profound book.
I am currently reading Guilt and Atonement, a book of universal culture that we should all read, and I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called Passions.
This was a response which was not well received, firstly because of the term 'civilizing' and secondly because it did not explain in detail how each of the books she mentioned had affected her.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit of The Little Prince.
Among other things, they say that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A Bogota journalist pointed out that the fact that she was the favourite, who received all the applause and who had won all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience voting for the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage".
And it was evident in her first swimsuit performance on the beach at the Hilton and her two elevators at the coronation.
Although she was safe with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the Magdalena and Atlántico representatives displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN's "Como en casa" programme, said that Melina's crown as Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not become queen after all".
And Valle avoided the press at the end of the show, which was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
There's a reason why, two days before the international jury assembled, Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had worked on projects before she entered the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriere and fibrosis noted in the stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good dietary habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there could be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis of the abdomen, which was hardly noticeable to me, to be honest, pushed her score on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgeries she had undergone.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to get them done right.
Her body was never her strong suit, and this job was paying off".
This award, which is being given for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, led to a cruel prediction that would come true overnight after the swimsuit appearance. It was speculated that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize to prevent her from enjoying the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina is entering her year of reign today, not as queen, but as princess, a position that will allow her to represent Colombia in one of the international beauty contests, upon nomination by the National Beauty Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming performance for Cartagena, escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A California lophoscopist went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a Lophoscopist from the Investigative Unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) in Cali went in as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC leader: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week's on call was Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked in communities in Chocó, where he often had to walk for five days through the jungle to reach the location of the bodies he was supposed to identify.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is subject to friction, i.e. the hands and feet.
During the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew he had to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one might be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he had to take the fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he and the examiner reached the location of the body, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, which was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints are not a lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell, and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the prints on the body with those on the printing plate.
He saw right, it was "Alfonso Cano".
That very night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
Searching for clues
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the recognition given by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against "Cano" was very important.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Loposcopists not only identify bodies, they also assist in murder and robbery investigations and confirm the identity of those arrested.
Many criminals present false identity papers when they are arrested or do not have any.
We'll take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The investigator told us that in one theft, he had to tear a piece of the wall out of a house, because the thief had stood up with his hand at that exact spot when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to exonerate or incriminate murder suspects.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation suggested that a family member might be a suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle was a match.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer is the killer, it does link him to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a plant cell or tape is used to take them away.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the crime database, or the personnel office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers", explained the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a comparison.
The "outraged" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Most of them complied with the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday as they tried again to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being evicted from the square at dawn and attempting to occupy another seat at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square, where they were trying to gain access with a court order allowing the "insurgents" to re-camp there. Meanwhile, another part of the movement complied with the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp on the square, we'll get together in another place and continue the battle through legal means to get back to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street.
Bray explained that the "outraged" response to the eviction of their tented camp, which was ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the square and allowing the protesters to camp.
The "outraged" also occupied a new park, located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact figures.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had gathered at the site, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived to show their support for the movement's members and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a private property) remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to examine the legality of the early morning eviction.
Some of the protesters who were driven from the square carried photocopies of the court order and even gave them to some police officers guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes", according to Bray, who reported that some police officers beat up protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to evict members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as to apply "laws passed after the occupation and to prohibit the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this court order the reopening of the square for public transport and the protesters had been suspended, and he pointed out to the protesters that the city laws did not allow them to set up tents and sleeping bags in this place again.
The mayor personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, which resulted in the arrest of nearly 200 people and was decided because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the evacuation because the square had "turned into a place where people came not to demonstrate, but to break the law and in some cases to harm other people", because "some businesses had received threats" and residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The morning-after clearance was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers", added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom".
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were considering organizing "big events" on Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the December 1st TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", lifeguard on "Baywatch", rabbit on "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model on a Canadian television Christmas show will be the Virgin Mary.
Private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the December 1st TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and bring a very special Virgin Mary to life.
CTV today released footage of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears in the online distribution of a self-made pornographic film in which she appears with her ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee - appears as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a host on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as the Jesus child.
CTV's Christmas program focuses not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian a "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption, ending the free fall spiral from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan had ever seen in World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be easing despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of falling, the figures for July to September finally completed this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% on a year-on-year basis.
The value recorded in the second quarter - Japan's financial year starts in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian initiatives which exploit the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been particularly awakened by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a harder currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy depends on the health of the big technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the appreciation of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"We must be aware of the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy, yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the greatest economic powers had pulled the brakes.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average of 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is again raising doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums of the peripheral countries soaring and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also losing itself further in the maze that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100 days agreed upon at his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would not withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October", Papadimos said yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara's communication does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else".
The Conservative leader went a step too far in challenging the EU and the IMF, the body that must unlock the 8 billion euros Athens desperately needs, by making it clear that he would not approve any commitment to implement the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effects of the Papandreou referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that its demands should not be wavered: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed" for the payment of the sixth tranche of €8 billion, although no final date has been set.
The Greek stick has strings for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the 'dominant' position of Spain in this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a world-leading position in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that over the last two decades Spain has become the second largest donor to this international cooperation fund in the world, which she said was "an instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in people".
The Queen, who yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microfinance in Valladolid, was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to meet the UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015, "especially the target of the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, below the poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the network of beneficiaries "to the farthest reaches of the world and is carrying out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will emerge from the summit, which runs until Thursday, will guarantee "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "facing many challenges".
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate but also a platform for the promotion of 'two fundamental objectives'.
The Queen stated that the aim is to have 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 10 million of these households will be above the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia describes as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the founder of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006, all of which "have seen continued progress", said the Queen, whose commitment to this project earned her yesterday the accolade of "head of family" in Valladolid and "spokesperson for the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her talk by encouraging the audience to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid in times of economic boom, as this was a "lasting commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of the developed countries should now "more than ever" work on solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be sacrificed to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "hope" to "marginalized" people "who are always in front of closed doors" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants to a city that "opens its doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democrat (CDU) Congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November was without any real difficulties for Chancellor Angela Merkel, chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has become apparent in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government's policy towards Greece today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission's presidency proposal proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstained.
The three European-minded finance ministers gave no indication of doubt at the several-minute standing ovation, which was first given to Angela Merkel and then to Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later, on the basis of their intervention decisions.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the motion, is that the answer to the crisis is 'not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which would strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, 'to give Europe a face'.
This is certainly one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood for Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
It is certainly unlikely that the 47 will agree to this revolution quickly: Great Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
But the milestone has been reached.
The delegates also rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to give each country weight in the ECB's Executive Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously strengthen Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is keen to calm the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened her links with Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has no longer sought to win her congress at the expense of the 'small' or troubled European countries which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European petition has a paragraph on the importance of 'German-French friendship', Angela Merkel does not mention France.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is the meaning of sickness fraud?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now tackling the sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family welfare fund and give a speech on the issue of combating social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been a recurring theme since 2007.
The majority wants to focus on workers' sickness reports to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy through a tough test, but which is also a precursor to a right-wing presidential campaign.
The first is the budgetary objective: the government is aiming to introduce a fourth day of leave before taking into account a sickness report for private sector workers.
In plain German, this means that a sick worker would lose four days' pay, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income, without the specific company's approval.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment in the event of a disaster.
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to improve the quality of the services provided by the public authorities, including the introduction of a new system of public health insurance for the disabled, and the introduction of a new system of public health insurance for the elderly.
While these issues are being discussed, the majority is also re-igniting the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence from work.
"Checks will be much more important and, moreover, they will be reimbursed if required", warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, before the microphone of the RTL broadcaster.
As in other cases, the impact of this reporting seems to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of sickness reports.
In fact, since 2002 it has been the subject of constant observation and political offensives, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more often ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
But let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid out in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation in Health, daily payments amounted to 5% of health expenditure in 2008, at EUR 11.3 billion.
This included 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, which amounts to EUR 6.2 billion.
And that's 2.5% of health care spending.
According to a study by Alma Consulting Group, in 2010 the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
One average, which masks some differences: another, published in 2007 by career planning website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by the health insurance, shows that 37% of sickness reports in 2010 were of less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days; 15% between 15 days and one month; 15% between one and three months; and 11% longer.
The French workers are therefore no more incapable of work than their European neighbours.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (due to sickness or otherwise) fluctuated between 10% and 11% in France, 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraudulent use of sickness reports is a very small proportion of the illegal employment.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of aid.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sickness reports exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public higher education institution for technicians and engineers) found that, among 1.5 million controls, 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness reports, i.e. 37,050 cases, were 'unjustified or too long'.
Of the systematically controlled cases of illness lasting more than 45 days, under 1.2 million, 11% were 'unadjusted or unjustified' cases, i.e. 132,000.
This means that there are 169,000 'unjustified' cases per million workers who have filed a sickness declaration.
The figures are small compared with, for example, the numbers of black workers.
According to Dominique Tian, a UMP member who wrote a report on the subject in July, this represents a tax loss of between EUR 9 and 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances and thus considerably more than the fraud in the latter case.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future.
This was announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in Parliament on Monday 14 November, citing the fact that the 100 days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
"To continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment", the Prime Minister said in his first public speech at the opening of Parliament's confidence vote debate on Wednesday.
He added that the implementation of the decisions taken at the 27 October Eurogroup meeting was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the eurozone was "at stake".
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit by 9% of GDP from now until the end of the year, after reaching 10,6% in 2010 and 15,7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new measures
The right-wing leader Antonis Samaras had given his approval on Monday for the measures already approved as an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be prepared to take additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures", he said at a parliamentary meeting of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to the targets of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was opposed to any policy which would impede the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures planned, had told Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure from Auven.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain relief to provide the best pain relief, even beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually talk to their doctor about the conditions they want to die under and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various interrelated disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
To begin, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent EIU, which compared the quality of deaths in 40 countries around the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to discuss death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to pain medication, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Of the country as a whole, Quebec has the highest rate of hospital deaths, at 86%.
On the sensitive question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report draw conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed its intention not to make any changes to the penal code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
But according to the experts who have simultaneously inspected all those countries whose approach to euthanasia and assisted suicide has legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would involve abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are many more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Eccompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Consider that, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll, 85 percent of Canadians had already voted in favor of euthanasia, believing that it would allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legal does not mean that the message is that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
41% of those who have already committed assisted suicide do not believe they should be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear as to whether the medicinal products should be maintained or discontinued in patients, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal code should specify that the disposal of funds for which a valid refusal has been submitted should not be considered criminal.
The panel also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect the end-of-life withdrawal requirement and to avoid criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain relief to provide the best pain relief, even beyond cancer.
Finally, the Committee calls for consideration to be given to the pain-relieving or life-threatening measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, since they were no more intended to reduce physical pain than euthanasia and were based on the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
The position of the experts who signed the report, in particular, was described as 'extreme' by Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, because it does not place any limits on the practice of euthanasia in the final stages of the disease.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age can ask another person to help them commit suicide", said RA Deschamps, who yesterday reviewed a summary of the report.
The authors of the report also seemed to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social work of society.
But, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, also expressed 'strong opposition' to the conclusions of the report, which she titled 'Pro-euthanasia manifesto'.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts reports of no abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king calls for President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a 'conspiracy' by the government
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Foreign Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who is resisting it thanks to Russia's support and is a 'conspiracy' against the country, intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League excluded Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite the position taken by Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the sitting Arab prime minister who yesterday called on President Bashar al-Assad to 'depose' in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the government have already been killed.
"If Bashar were to put his country's interests at heart, he would step down, but more than that, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, complained that the Turkish mediation efforts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave", he said, referring to Syria, the neighbor to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken a more and more sharp tone in the face of the repressions in Syria", observes Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have been killed in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two more civilians were killed in "shooting and heavy bombing in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim said that the country was "turning towards the end of the crisis".
He also emphasized the importance of the European Union's role in the Middle East, and called for the establishment of a European security and defence policy.
He added that Syria "will not give in", adding that "the plots against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "civilian protection mechanism" and is calling for the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said was encapsulated in his "paranoia".
An extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the emergency plan agreed on 2 November, in particular the controversial withdrawal of military forces from the besieged cities and the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision yesterday to avoid advocating possible sanctions against Damascus "incorrect", even though China had already urged Syria to implement its crisis-resolution plan.
The European Union
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian prime minister, has asked the markets for a little more time to form his staff and implement a programme that calls for 'sacrifices' to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a meeting with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is composed of relatively strictly external technocrats.
'Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims,' said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office.
The European Parliament has also been asked to vote on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
The negotiations will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of cancellations, which will no doubt include a dozen ministers and even the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness on the stock and bond markets was demanding of its time.
He said that "in a democracy there are certain deadlines" for preparing a government and a government programme, and that it was "certain that the markets will be rational and wise".
The President's order was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The incumbent Prime Minister was to set up a staff made up mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include 'politicians'.
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
The new government should receive the confidence vote of parliament by Friday, according to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies.
Since taking up his duties, Mr Monti has committed himself to working urgently towards the goal of making Italy a "re-established protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even in the light of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans undertaken in recent months, has in particular requested new austerity measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's 'chief of executives', who will meet in Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to stimulate the economy, 'since a country which has no growth cannot respect deficit indicators'.
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "Challenge of trustworthiness" and a "different Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The big unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to borrow 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-capable warhead, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS based the result on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
The IAEA had expressed its "serious concern" last week about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to a detailed study of IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently worked at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Ural for over three decades since the early 1960s, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company in Kiev producing "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He was involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its final report, the IAEA noted 'strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear explosive system' had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only extremely proficient in this technology but, as one member of the Agency stated, had spent his entire professional career working on this technology directly in the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin.'
Anti-Islamic crimes and offenses have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims rose by 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes either declined slightly or increased only slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while there was a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offences globally.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose to a very modest 6,628 cases, including 47.3% of racially motivated crimes and 20% of religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and offences rise again", Human Rights First stressed. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant", the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered serious human rights violations", added Paul Legendre, a spokesman for the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks", he added, noting that this could be done by improving policing of hate crimes.
The "hate crime" is a legacy of the civil rights era in US federal law.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence against race, colour, religion or descent and now also includes offences of sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing the platform and becoming more and more like Facebook
Microblogging website Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform to allow users to monitor the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and a different "Name" enable better live-readable tracking of the activities of other "Twitter users", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and who follow your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to follow their news, whether they subscribe to new posts, favour certain news, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before its general internet release on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its less instinctive functioning, with some esoteric-looking wording. Followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The 'Activity' feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter stream", @dannykronstrom reported.
Austria
The introduction of a 'Golden Rule' in the Constitution
The ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Grand Coalition government in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a 'Golden Rule' in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Socialist Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that Austria's public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the level of debt in countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not been reduced by a stroke from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of additional interest each year", argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister.
Austria also responds to a request from the Brussels Summit of Eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had demanded that the reduction of public deficits be included in the Constitution by the end of 2012 and that the balance of the public accounts be restored or that an equivalent law be adopted.
The Austrian Government's approach is similar to the German model, since Germany was the first European country to introduce such a rule into its constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 onwards the structural budget deficit of the federal state should not exceed the 0,35% of GDP threshold, while the regional states should have balanced budgets, as should the municipalities.
The objective is to eliminate budgetary debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement by the 2020/21 horizon.
The strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we detect excessive volatility in the yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did last time", Mr Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen accelerated again to near the historic levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold heavily against the dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which is about to hit a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen above this level on a regular basis, helped by purchases by investors who see the yen as a "refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and the debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic 105 yen lathe near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at 120 yen, the euro at more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency is detrimental to the archipelago's exports, as it increases the cost of 'Made in Japan' products and reduces the value of income drawn by Japanese firms from abroad, as they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast", stresses M. Noda, who fears that the rising yen could kill off the weak recovery in its infancy.
The third world economic power has regained traction for the first time this year, with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared with the previous quarter - thanks to the rapid growth in exports and consumption by households "clogged" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister believes that the appreciation of the yen does not reflect"the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all feasible measures to de-valuate the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, informed that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", indicating that no additional monetary easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the central bank had increased its purchases of government bonds by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) to clear the 55,000 billion yen (€519 billion) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial securities in order to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
Interest rates are rising, stock markets are retreating
The risk of the debt crisis spreading is continuing to undermine the European indicators.
Despite the accession of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock markets, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 o'clock and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions over government bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global stock markets continue to release part of their recent gains.
"Investors are nervous and all too aware of the risk of contagion", Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is suffering from renewed fears among market participants about the capacity of Europe in the face of a continuation of the debt crisis, closed down by 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited volatility corridor until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is hurting the single currency, which continues to bite on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 o'clock the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it was down 0.4%.
According to the stock market brokers, it has declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party, which met in the Congress on Monday, accepted a request that, in particular, countries in difficulty be allowed to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while the yield on Spanish bonds reached 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investor fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti asked the markets for more time to re-establish the situation in Italy threatened by debt paralysis.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the 27 October Eurozone summit was the 'main task' of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth figures for the euro area
Statistically, France recorded a 0.4% growth in the third quarter, supported by household consumption, slightly better than the 0.3% expected.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the declines in the second quarter figures to a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries economic experts.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first eurozone-wide rebate is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogma
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of firms.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this subject and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Despite the fact that there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic changes are driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so that a huge proportion of the world's population will not have to give up one vital element.
At the same time, the shortage of fossil fuels must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident at Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is making its decision dependent on the need to find a substitute source, or in Switzerland, which is just now planning to build only last generation nuclear power stations.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided to attach another unit to its nuclear power plant after Fukushima by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model of renewable energy is sometimes cited as a model, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will be reflected in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on Russia in particular, due to the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal power plants.
The full range of these unpleasant effects will become apparent within a few months.
The Danish case is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, and is one of the largest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy, which means that its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future of the European Union.
As energy prices in a globalised economy are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of stability for industry at national level, French companies have an advantage in Europe by being the cheapest electricity supplier.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community, but it has already decided on the future of the Community.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment by the use of renewable energy sources.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of the European Union's external relations policy, and has been involved in the implementation of the European Union's external relations policy.
If France were to decide to withdraw from nuclear power, a large number of these SMEs would suffer, and the annual exports of capital goods and nuclear energy worth EUR 6 billion would shrink further and further.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to run for 60 years if the downfall of his producer is pre-programmed?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no miracle cure for electricity, no more than there is a work of the devil.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
The maintenance of the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority which carries out uncompromising and transparent checks on existing works, such as the construction works in Flamanville.
The safety concept is the obsession of their teams, which have made a name for themselves through their professionalism.
In the last 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major disruptions.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, without any consequences for man or the environment.
The tragedy at Chernobyl was brought about by reactor design and by irreparable human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it did from the two preceding ones.
The result of this approach and the cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power stations, the EPR is a design which enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since the construction of a nuclear power plant is considered desirable by the electrical engineering community, a halt in the construction of Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party habits dominate a debate which also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is Immigration a Burden or an Opportunity for the Economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overburdening of police, judicial and administrative bodies by a policy of numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior casually announcing (see Libération of 23 May) that France "didn't need any talent, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", and on the left by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 argued that France "cannot take on all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of grossness.
The fear of invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both right and left in 2005.
Both sides saw immigrants as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of rudeness that one is willing to admit to the immigrant.
Francois Hollande's programme is limited to trivia, which suggest that partnership development will solve our migration problems.
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the election; but it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the influx of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Restricting immigration would stunt growth and damage the labour market.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace the local workforce, especially the less skilled, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the local wage-workers, as they predominantly work in sectors which are technically underutilized.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors which do not attract local wage-workers, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not matched to the labour supply.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, so this complementarity between natives and migrants has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in the immigration influx would lead to a related, long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas brought in by immigrants is beneficial to economic growth (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute to social systems on a net basis, on average at around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 makes a net contribution to the public budget (income minus expenditure) of about EUR 150,000 over the course of his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to "make the teeth" of the missing intersections when he took office.
These teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it is time to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable commodity; it is also a delicate commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had spent the whole of the 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some people had probably thought that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon the Little that it was a feature of the mind.
The universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and may well become an 'instrument of repression', as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a judiciary.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek truth-false referendum would have had a double revealing character in this respect: on the one hand, the need for a vigorous return to politics, but on the other hand, the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by pressing for a national referendum to succeed, which was organized according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A free-range for the European sole ruler or a blindfolded leap into the void of nationalist retreat: a grand choice for the citizen!
We want a hacking axe, but a collective task, fully legitimate, clarified and continuous, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - and you don't know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffer from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on an international level.
The European Union is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, whereas Europe as a whole is losing its sovereignty and with it each of the nations that are part of it.
The urgency is to give back to the sovereignty of the peoples the leadership of the European project.
The European Union is a great example of a European economy which is not only a European economy but also a European economy.
The way out of the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to ruin.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
I agree.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it promises to citizens - would be another foolishness and another dead end.
We must embark on a new phase of European integration.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe in political terms, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to build Europe.
Contactless chip cards become common
The world fair for chip cards opens its doors in an optimistic mood in Villepinte, near Paris, on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards, telephones) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which allows for payment on public transport or payment for purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million a year earlier!
Their market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment, having long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the start is rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visas were distributed.
But the consumer markets are booming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically issuing contactless chip cards to their customers in the future", announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment system of the future: the mobile phone.
A very small percentage of devices are equipped with the near field communication (NFC) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"They are late".
"But they should at least see a real upward trend next year".
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless payments by mobile phone.
Terrorist front, of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram appear to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty" about this.
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence relations suggest a clear cooperation", he said, without going into details.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has revealed a number of links.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were abducted by Aqmi supporters in a restaurant in Niamey, were reportedly killed the following day, at the same time as several of their kidnappers, in an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene.
The terrorist axis
Analysis of the telephone calls made reveals several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two callers: one number leads to a Nigerian who had been staying in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more definitive evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It is conceivable, though".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from Auwen and that it is increasingly active", mitigates Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these 'support services' have become more visible in their course, as have Boko Harem's speeches and modes of operation, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been pressing Abuja ever since to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long regarded the group as a community of Illuminati that does not need special attention.
Fast Success
Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace", is seeking to establish an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this region, which is in dire straits, the merger is making rapid progress.
It politicizes itself and claims strict Sharia observance, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists are targeting churches, bars and government agencies.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing their attacks on police stations.
The reaction from Abuja, however, is as usual indifferent.
The army is surrounding the city, counting 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, who was captured, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and is leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an attack in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing at a secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes a priority international destination.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis from al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé, speaking to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, warned of Boko Harem and said he was ready to "give all the clues".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivals in simplicity and ignorance about China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, if not simplistic ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, the voters might almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their supporters have been making their thunderous statements and their statements about the traditional Republican focus on the open air.
China, Iran and aid to Israel are all covered in slogans, often without any substantiation.
Mitt Romney, the most vocal on the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is most irritated by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
He said it was foolish to imply that this would lead to a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost shut down about his emotionally flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (also the current stance of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being heard, stagnating in the depths of the polls.
The image of Reagan
Romney had also promised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program failed.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran", he had said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb".
He also promised increased military aid to Israel and accused Obama of defaulting on his commitments to that partner.
The second-ranked candidate, businessman Herman Cain, is also showing a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
He recently called for a counter-measure to the Chinese military threat as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to overlook the fact that China has had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, has expressed his willingness to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The 2009 Obama ban on the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, who is a political heavyweight.
Unlike the current presidential opponents, Reagan had also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite all of them.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine when it came to the issue of counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive two-way talks with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility is not entirely unforced.
The public is more likely to appreciate the positive record of national security under Obama, which took out bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military intervention leading to paralysis.
And Obama surprisingly more aptly argues that America needs to rebuild economically to revive its leadership.
Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glamour.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which links Russia and Germany directly under sea level, on the Baltic coast last Tuesday, to orchestral accompaniment and a fine-tasting buffet.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically turned the steering wheel of the valve that will carry Russian gas to the Western European grid.
The new gas pipeline is intended to supply 27,5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe via an initial 1,224 km pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which will allow a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - equivalent to total French consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of a third line being built on the same line is already being hinted at.
The timely and accurate completion of this enormous construction project is a victory for Gazprom.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
The European Union has been a major player in the development of the region, and the European Union has been a major contributor to the development of the region.
Warsaw, the most involved in the debate, was not shy about comparing the Nord Stream pipeline to a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
But this is at the expense of a disempowerment of European energy, as the project has cut a gap between Western and Eastern Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption and dwindling gas reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way", François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the pipeline, pointing out the political and economic importance of major gas contracts.
All this explains the broad smiles of the Gazprom managers, who are very numerous in Lubmin, when it comes to the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with a concrete casing to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 meters.
The construction of the new facilities was designed to avoid the use of World War II-era minefields.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, more measures were needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The cable is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is uninterrupted by anything along its length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the Swedish coast, but the project was abandoned because the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state-owned company permanently established on their shores.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas leak in less than a minute", Jens Müller explained.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas line will escape into the air.
However, this is considered by the designers to be unlikely, since the welding seams have been estimated to have a leakage rate of one per 100,000 years.
State control of the gas pipeline is provided by both an underwater robot controlled from a seagoing vessel for external observation purposes and a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It is shaped like a cigar, has a diameter of one metre, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is moved by gas pressure.
After three full days of traveling through the line at a speed of 3 metres per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformation of the metal on arrival.
The gas transmission was designed to run for fifty years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is ensured by simple pressure.
This is 200 bar at the point of entry and 100 bar at the point of exit.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) are also included, as are Gasunie in the Netherlands and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company all of its gas transport capacity on a 20-year renewable contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the volume of gas it actually transports", Jens Müller said.
The financing of the gas pipeline was 30% secured by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work for both pipelines is expected to be EUR 7.4 billion.
For example, the investment for GDF Suez amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders were reluctant to recover their costs, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea near Lubmin on a sandy, pine-forested stretch of coastline.
The 15 feet high valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook. What is it?
Moleskine, who started a company in Italy some 15 years ago, is now trying to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, candlelight hours spent writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular wrapper, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored pages, as if aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a distinctive design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called mole skin, which refers to a cotton lacquer used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists", explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and reached 12,7 million units.
This is a far cry from the usual production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to get a phantom picture of the buyers, since the notebook is as much a source of excitement for businessmen as for students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of a cosmopolitan, cultured, open-minded client.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centres and is keen to assert its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new need for writing, which persists despite the surge in e-mails", explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard pattern wrapper for the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and was able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand has the full range of items.
A success that aroused jealousy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus opening a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today is the start of the 15th week of work for the disabled.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging you?
"No", says Éric Blanchet, director-general of the Adapt association, which organises the "Working Week for the Disabled".
"The progress made in fifteen years is considerable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not doubled, but tripled".
"Nevertheless, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done".
It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed people, numerous obstacles remain before they can find a job.
The elderly are more likely to be affected: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, longterm unemployment is also widespread: 53% of the disabled compared with 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the workforce, and that are "at the heart of the problem", says Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
The unspoken remain, the attitudes that are certain but slow to develop.
A study carried out in April by the IMS Entrepreneurs Association for La Cité magazine found that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about disabled people", which was "over-represented" by "people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually handicapped".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the 6% target of disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
The latter figures, which date from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at the 3% mark", says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the organization charged with collecting contributions from companies that break the law.
The evidence is that the number of 'feepaying' establishments has decreased, as has the total amount paid, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, put a lot of pressure on companies", said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, particularly in the case of large groups of companies".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while enterprises with between 100 and 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a stroke of luck".
Even before they faced the "Blue Tuesday evening" at 8:45 p.m., Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens hadn't hidden the pleasure of the friendly match.
It would be too far-fetched to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks of symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after his attacker's temperamental gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had received nothing but praise for his personality.
"I'm very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian".
"I want to look ahead", assures the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his performance in club and national team, "It's a unity that justifies everything".
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will be coming to Saint-Denis, bringing in Friday night against Romania for the match against France, to finally "shine".
But without omitting the "pleasure" element.
He has been playing for the French national team since the age of seven, leading the team to victories between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported", he said.
This inevitably contributes to reinforcing the 'unique' character of this meeting.
"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there", he said.
"We just crossed paths".
"To play against them is great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, kindly said "Pride".
"Pride of a Galamatch".
"Proud" also to confirm - in its capacity as"neighbour" - that France has "become a team at a very high level again", and this just over a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job", he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be absent from the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French National team)... to Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are getting along great", he stressed.
"We're planning something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll notice that at the upcoming games, including the game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the rematch against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams had been unsuccessful in the game.
"At the end of 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that La Selecçao, his national team, for which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal, that is really only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is one match to be played and one opponent to be eliminated, and that is Bosnia.
Given the 0-0 draw on Friday in Zenica Hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to give the matter the important stamp that would have taken the pressure off it.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we didn't score a goal".
But at home, in their brightly lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident of making it in front of an audience that is likely to be equally keen on the game, even if the game was, of course, announced as 'very close', said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are absolutely confident that we can win the game", explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we didn't score a goal", Bento regrets.
"We will be playing against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese planned to exert maximum pressure on the Bosniaks from the outset, to 'not allow them time to think'.
A good idea, provided it is put into action this time.
