The risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is increasing in the European Union/Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The case of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) reflects a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom proving that, while at a different level depending on the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is developing rapidly in all countries.
Based on evidence from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the increase in COVID-19 patients who will require medical care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown genome was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a newly identified infectious agent that is a novel coronavirus that has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease that causes SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild infection, that is, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these are getting better.
In 14% of patients, COVID-19 progresses into a severe illness requiring hospitalization while a further 6% experience a severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the variation in the incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 infections in the EU/EEA and UK with Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
Beyond China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to various countries and the rapid pace of the COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world is currently following this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first European confirmed case of COVID-19 based on WHO case data.
Within the EU/EEA, France first reported three cases on 24 January 2020 among people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, where between 31 December 2019 and the present date combined, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Collecting and aggregating the total number of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 statistics are announced for every country in the world, which are derived from only official sources such as international health ministries, national health authorities and WHO, and are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As a representative of the current trends in COVID-19 cases, we calculated 14 days of cumulative incidence and decreased incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the trajectory of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, between 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also introduced a summation of the number of notifications of the case of the virus in each country as of 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy as of 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 patterns in the EU/EEA and UK
The 14-day cumulative suspension of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK was followed by the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increasing COVID-19 cases (Extra load).
Figure 2 shows the case of COVID-19 infection, in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to that in Italy for 31 January - 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 8:00 am, some 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported cases comparable to Italy's 3 weeks ago or less.
Our findings show that the number of COVID-19 infections is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observations in the incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the epidemic has progressed rapidly and steadily across all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries have been at different stages, in national public health responses, and possibly different jurisdictions within countries and different criteria for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19, including access to testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported a situation where ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of patients to hospital for COVID-19 and/or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be compiled in a systematic manner to match current surveillance data that focuses on case reporting and mortality rates.
A 2010-11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and nursing beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have resources or less than Italy (12.5 intensive care and equivalent care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The designation criteria related to the healthcare facility occupancy, the estimated incidence of each EU/EEA country and UK hospitalisation for COVID-19 cases that meet the &gt; > 90% risk of over-the-counter care, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
As it is a common infection in some EU/EEA countries and the UK, hospitals and intensive care units often serve known local populations, information on disease incidence and care beds is best obtained at the Nomenclature of territorial units for census 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Lessons learned from Italy and current developments in other countries have shown that the COVID-19 epidemic is evolving rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the possibility of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, as well as specialized care, as is occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As shown in the latest ECDC risk assessment, rapid, comprehensive and complete action is critical to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from progression to mitigation, as rapid increases in the number of cases cannot provide adequate and timely counseling to hospitals for understanding, acceptance and adaptation of the process ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as countries have the opportunity to increase their containment efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health pressure.
With this said, it is likely that the healthcare systems of some EU/EEA countries will face a significant increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, becoming a catastrophe for humanity.
Similar to the same virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence and mortality than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more older adults than younger people and more men than women.
Due to the response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a comprehensive review on the development of the rapidly developing diagnostic topic.
We will learn the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review has helped in understanding and eliminating the menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 was an unforgettable occasion for all Chinese who were asked to stay home throughout this holiday and for many weeks after the outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the related virus was named CoV Cory-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 others worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovering and more than 3,000 patients dying.
"WHO warned that COVID-19 is the ""number 1 public enemy"" and potentially more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment have been published since the first report on January 7, 2020 which identified the disease as isolated from a large number of patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and rapidly developing topic of geography.
Whenever possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV that caused the disease, the Arabian respiratory syndrome (MERS outbreak, in 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about preventing the causes of the disease and some questions that remain.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-toxic to humans, with a prevalence of about 15% in influenza 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered two human pathogens, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the original outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries with severe outbreaks and fatalities.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure.1, the novel pneumonia virus first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Service.
Seven days later the CoV protocol was re-launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first case was reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the disease quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, a report was released by the health authorities, suggesting that human-to-human transmission is a possibility.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under lockdown and public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the initial clinical investigation of the outbreak reported that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 people had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the initial site of infection from animal sources.
On 30 January, the WHO declared a global emergency.
As of the time of this report's compilation, the disease had already spread in China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig. 2).2)
As the process proceeds at a rapid rate, the final course and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, an institute-wide survey of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a newly available epidemiological data as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS affects people of all ages, but is most common in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, a few were under 20 years old, and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 is more common in men (0.31 / 100,000) than in women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 has spread rapidly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes a minimum of 5 (2-9) days from the initial diagnosis to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
Average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13)
The baseline birth rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 adjustment was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections rose sharply before 23 January 2020, which coincided with the transit time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases of infection was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the overall mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and chronic pneumonia.
CoVs are members of a family of large virus envelopes that contain a single RNA strand.
It can be classified into three subfamilies, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
Ambulaf binds the (S) glycoprotein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the di-dihydroxypeptidase 4 (DPP4) receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after the cell is reconstituted, the genomic RNA is sealed back with an envelope of glycofurotin and nucleocapsid proteins to form virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the cell.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 samples collected from the source of the outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the human epithelium of the respiratory system.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to human ACE2 than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can produce a short protein coated by orf3b and a protein coated by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in virulence and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 lacks a known domain function or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM sequence of the human full ACE2 at a 2.9 Å resolution in the complex amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which is detected open and closed, is assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which provides evidence for CoV diagnosis and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug trials to suppress infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The origin and the center of the epidemic.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and are transmitted to humans via cats and camels.
Through comparison of the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the virus was considered to be the host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus was 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from the bat called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, where the intermediate host helps the virus to cross the species barrier to catch humans is still unknown, and the pathway of transmission is still to be determined.
Ji, et al., introduced snakes as a vector of the virus from bats to humans that is associated with interactions between S proteins.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-nosed, mouth-to-mouth, scavengers used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the most probable SARS-COV-2 viruses based on 99% genetic diversity in a CoV that was identified in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However the 1% difference spread over the two genes is still a significant difference; therefore, the final results are awaited for conclusive proof (Fig.{Fig.}Fig.33).
The genetic properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in test vessels for up to 48 hours in bush conditions for up to 5 days at below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 reportedly withstands heat and humidity at 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing chemicals, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other lipid-lowering agents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively degrade the virus.
The population as a whole has lost immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new strain of the virus.
Currently, no comprehensive studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).4).
Generally, after the virus has invaded the host, it is first recognized by the body's immune response by receptors (PRRs) including C-type receptors, toll-like receptor (TLR), toll-like receptor-like (NLR), and RIG-like-I receptors (RLR).
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell membranes, and the growth of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and increase the levels of bacterial antibodies.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune response.
Soon, the anti-virus response was engaged in a battle with the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a critical role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells kill the infected virus directly.
T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to assist the cells in defending against them.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Neuroprotective compounds including compounds like C3a and C5a and antibodies are essential to fight infection.
For example, the isolation of immune cells from a recovering patient has isolated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overload of the immune system results in a high amount of free radiation in the home that can cause damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in extreme cases, multiple bacterial failure and even death.
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, which is expressed by a combination of mutations, is likely to occur in elderly people with certain infections and in pregnant women.
It is common for people who are highly contagious or whose activities are isolated to be at higher risk of infection than others.
The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, typically 3-7 days based on the initial analysis of 425 infected individuals in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 infected people showed that the average delivery time was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, however, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) days based on a history of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to align the isolation period with the shelf life, thus preventing infection but preventing people who are not contagious from spreading the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are in public, or who are infected, are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the period of separation be extended to 24 days?
Fever is the main and earliest symptom of COVID-19, which can be associated with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, nerve pain, hypertension, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have been prone to develop severe respiratory tract disease, neuromuscular shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without symptoms of pneumonia, should be screened for the virus for early detection.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the incidence of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry mouth, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar cases have been reported in two recent studies of family cough and cough caused by transmission from a person with symptoms of the disease.
In comparison, a 2012 human study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and correspond to a higher incidence of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%) dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were reported to be the main symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the COVID-19 death toll stood at 2% as the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, deaths from SARS from November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 people who had been confirmed to have been infected with the virus.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was above 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4 only.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV based on their symptoms, mortality, and R0 are presented in Table Table1.1.
The above factors suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less transmissible than the latter two.
Thus, it is more challenging to control SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
A single-place collision often occurs several times in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle such as a boat.
Patients generally have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected or sick individuals in the last two weeks before onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can re-infect, which sends an alarm for extended isolation periods.
Patients have an equal or decreased number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count <4 × 109/L combined with a lymphocyte count <1 × 109/L, and elevated ascorbate aminotransferase and viremia were observed in 1,099 patients infected with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and vascular enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and red blood cell count were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a degraded fibrin molecule present in the blood, is increased, and the number of lymphocytes is reduced.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by double-blind or double-ground imaging in the lungs.
The majority of patients suffered from pneumonia, acute pulmonary insufficiency, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled swelling, fluid retention, and progressive fibrosis severely impair the gas exchange.
The imbalance of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the level of surfactant and increases inflammation, thereby reducing lung expansion capacity and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst heart scan often looks like the most severe stage of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 test showed a lack of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, and viral plaque, as well as multiple bacterial cell characteristics in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, similar to the case of ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criteria for the COVID-19 test.
However, due to the high rate of absence of detection, which can accelerate the spread of the disease, clinical symptoms were first used for diagnostic purposes (which do not rely on RT-PCR) alone in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the outbreak of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history, clinical diagnosis, laboratory and radiological examination is important and necessary for a proper diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang team described a method of using CRISPR's SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthetic molecules at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than one hour without the need for apparatus.
Hopefully, the new technique can improve mental health and well-being if it is proven in clinical trials.
Due to limited experience with novel CoVs, physicians may be able to provide specialized care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other infections (Table 2).2).
These current and potential treatments include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was donated for medical use.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory damage and paralysis are the main risks to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes all respiratory treatment, ventilation, ventilation from the ventilator, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with symptoms of acute respiratory distress must be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiac management technique used for the treatment of acute cardiac arrhythmias or respiratory failure.
In addition, the regulation of electrolyte balance, prevention and monitoring of infection and secretion, and protection from organ activity are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storms are known to occur as a result of an over-reaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine activation is a type of natural response of the inflammatory system that is induced by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines along with the host cell release a large number of unchanged hormones that are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunization is important to control cytokine storm, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine cyclones.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine cyclones include the modulation and direct response of T cell immunity; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressant 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid medications, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking steroids in high doses is not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which causes chronic pain.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in low-to-moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution for COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective vaccine.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, is found to be effective in US COVID-19 patients.
Remdesivir is a novel antibiotic developed by Gideon initially for the treatment of infections caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, secretory also showed the possibility of inhibiting other single RNA viruses including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gideon has given the compound to China to run two trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and is expected to have good results.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as sedative agents for patients with acute respiratory distress.
Nausea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other painful reactions may occur after the combination of treatment with lofinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions of these with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered immunity.
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to give to other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the health of others from infection has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients usually have a high level of antibodies in their blood.
The immune system is a type of immunoglobulin (Ig) produced from B lymphocytes to fight off viruses and other foreign substances and to detect specific antibodies in the infections they contain.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with less inflammation and less pain and improved oxygen levels in the blood.
However, verification and explanation is necessary to introduce the method for general use before specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the curative effect, some plasma-related disorders should be considered gradually.
For example, immune system disorders can overwhelm the immune system and cause the release of an alcytokine signal, which can be life-threatening.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is high to treat patients who are suffering from a disease.
It is difficult to develop and rapidly produce specific vaccines to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is most important and desirable to isolate B cells from healthy and recovered patients and identify cell lines that are associated with improved immune response or specifically target the immune system against important proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a number of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness depends on the combination of several compounds in a formula that varies depending on the clinical study considered in the TCM hypothesis.
Many of the active ingredients are unknown or misunderstood because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or components.
Currently, due to the ineffectiveness and specificity of COVID-19 therapy, TCM has become one of the preferred treatment options for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the treatment of Shu Feng Jie Du and the treatment of Lian Hua Qing Wen has been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
High recovery rates of COVID-19 patients in several Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a poor comparison as other influential factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study to compare Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with the combination of WM therapy and TCM.
They found that the times required for recovery of physical condition, symptom impairment, and hospitalization were significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
More interestingly, the incidence of injury and disease (from mild to severe) was lower in the WM+TCM group than that of the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still awaiting further highly controlled trials on a larger scale and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to know the nature of the practices and to describe the effective therapeutic tools of TCM or their combination if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 often experience greater fear of infectious disease and even death, and people who are isolated also experience depression, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, infectious symptoms such as fever, dysphagia, and cough as well as various medical reactions such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there was a range of psychiatric conditions including chronic anxiety, depression, panic, agitation, symptoms of depression, aggression, and even suicide.
Contact and isolation of infected people, as part of the public health response to the spread of COVID-19, may lead people to become overly anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, isolation, and hostility towards family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, and persons in contact with them and other vulnerable members of the public.
The support should include the establishment of multi-stakeholder health groups, clear communication with regular updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and management plans and the use of electronic devices and apps to avoid close contact with each other.
Antibiotics are essential to interrupt the transmission pathways from the animal body and the infection of humans to pathogens more easily and often contribute to the treatment of bacterial immunity to treat the anabacteria caused by emerging pathogens.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-rich vaccines to provide long-lasting and immunosuppressive immunity and/or immunosuppression against SARS-CoV infection.
A live vaccine was evaluated in an animal model of SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in older people with immunodeficiency specimens and their protection against zoonotic viral infection has yet to be determined prior to the start of clinical trials.
It is likely because SARS died out less than 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, devastating cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and have spread to other regions due to persistent zoonotic pathways in infected areas.
Immunization strategies for MERS have been developed using non-viral resistant virus, DNA plasmids, viral particles, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and evaluated micronutrients and in some animal models.
The development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical step to address the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the complexity due to the long time (at least 18 months) required for the development of vaccine and variation mutation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only recently become fully established as a clinical disease by thousands of new infections.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a higher mortality in patients with a severe case of infection.
Therefore, the creation of a disease surveillance system is critical for health authorities to prioritize its activities, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on clinical trials reported to date, the following factors may affect or may be associated with the development of COVID-19 patients (Tebur (Tebur33)):
Age: Age is the most important prognosis for SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is most prevalent in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of these patients were older than 50 in the 8,866 case studies as described above.
Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have other co-morbidities and complications and are older than those who do not (at a median age of 66 and 51), suggesting age as a predictor of disease onset for patient outcomes of COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males than females (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Disorders and difficulties: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe cardiac arrhythmia and arrhythmia.
Heart attack is the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to ACL2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and disease are closely related and can interfere with each other.
Laboratory testing that is not routine: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate severe inflammation or tissue injury and have been proposed to be a possible cause of loss of disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The relationship of CRP levels to severity and the likelihood of COVID-19 infection was also advised.
In addition, the enhancement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue breakdown.
So, they are heart transplant doctors or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Cardiogram and the development of a transient genetic basis for clinical symptoms should be evaluated along with other criteria to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroid drugs: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant drugs that are commonly used as a complementary therapy to reduce the severity of inflammatory disorders.
Since many corticosteroids were widely used in SARS patients, many of the survivors suffered from osteonecrosis with life-limiting disabilities and reduced survival.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used for small doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from severe psychological stress as they endured long periods of isolation and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of family members and friends from the illness.
It is important to provide long-term counseling and support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the population studies to date, the COVID-19 marker has a distinct epidemiological feature from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also replicate extensively in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no early signs of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients who are infected at an early stage or during the incubation period may produce a large amount of virus during routine activities, creating great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is considered to occur when patients are in the early stages of illness, while most transmission does not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Intensive measures are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and its surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of the general population in the hope of ending the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Despite these actions damaging the economy of the country and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a declining epidemic.
The best expectation is that the outbreak will end in March and the monsoon season will last for 3-4 months.
Still, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team from Canada reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the central turbinate and throat of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the new virus it presents could be a variant of the influenza-like virus.
However, signs have emerged in China based on the decline in new cases, which suggests the strategy is now working.
The Ebola virus has already been predicted to cause one million cases of infection and half a million deaths.
However, through isolation and isolation, the disease eventually died.
It is likely that, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become weak in infection and eventually die or become less virulent with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread by coughing or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with materials that are contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in bone, which raises the new possibility of bone-to-bone transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of these infections were possible through nosocomial infection, including 17 patients with other back infections and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, greater protection should be used to protect people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even those who come into contact with sick or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and the N95 type respirator (series #1860) helps control the spread of infectious agents.
Surgical masks prevent waterborne infections from potentially infected people from traveling through the air or sticking to the surface of objects, where they can be transmitted to others.
However, N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions being able to pass through completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and the total is about 85 m.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks that are individually packaged, healthcare workers in direct contact with patients must wear an N95 (series # 1860s) mask but not a surgical mask.
In addition to face masks, healthcare workers should wear isolation vests to further reduce exposure to viruses.
Bacteria can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through the fluid in his eyes.
Therefore, healthcare workers also wear a face shield or mask while working with patients.
For the general public in affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap and detergent to prevent the most common transmission of the virus, try to stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Six feet is considered to be the ideal distance for people to sit to avoid sickness.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent further spread of the virus
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a relatively new virus to the human world, its high risk to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should cause great alarm for China in light of its deep recall of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the citizens by saying that the new strain of the coronavirus has low transmission and low human-to-human fertility and is not a problem for the prevention and control of the disease.
The message has sparked public outcry, especially as the entire country prepares for the spring festival, and it has taken a long time to contain the virus in Wuhan.
The disease control authorities in China may take this lesson and make important advances in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful in making public announcements as each word is directed at citizens and can change attitudes and decisions; (2) more disengaged and focused on unknown information from hospitals rather than waiting for detailed information from doctors or authorities; (3) more proactive in preventing the transmission of an epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more often to provide accurate information and effective methods for increasing public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve community response mechanisms in certain cases.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to the concept of SARS resurgence.
However, there are some striking differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for both prevention of epidemics and management of patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults more than young people and men more than women, and the mortality rate is lower and higher in older adults than in younger people.
SARS had a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they do not show symptoms while SARS patients usually do so when they are very ill, which makes it more difficult to transmit COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is faster and wider than that of SARS-CoV.
Conventional RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients may be positive for recurrence of the disease.
These findings increased the risk of spreading the disease.
Given such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, the most pressing issues can be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs has been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal species is the intermediate in transmitting the virus from the original pathogen-carrier, the mosquito, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and #2, we cannot properly interrupt the transmission, and the outbreak may re-occur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and genetic validation have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the cell cycle and cause mutations in the virus?
Does the virus also carry ACE2 expression genes in other organs?
Without the answers to these questions, we cannot have a reliable diagnostic and therapeutic system.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus change the way it is transmitted between people?
Could it become a global pandemic, dying like SARS or recurring periodically like the flu?
It is important but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and many others.
However, with whatever funds he required, we had no choice but to end the illness quickly and return to our normal life.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have led to the evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has turned the tide to explain how HCoV outbreaks can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 pushed the range of CoVs forward and surprised us by its relatively low transmissibility but relatively low virulence compared to its cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are primarily transmitted from animals and understanding the origin of HcoVs helps to tell.
Most HCoVs have their genome from bats where they were non-pathogenic.
The organisms that cause infection by some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying the exact animal that is infected will help directly protect people from the disease.
The study of animal-to-human co-infection may help to identify the spread of CoV virus genes in humans.
In this review, we presented an overview of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, with a focus on their detection history and how the zoonotic strains originated and spread.
The key here is to distinguish HCoVs from understanding how the original virus mutates and the genetic material from its original source.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is described here.
In addition, the need for a successful viral replication is emphasized and the evolutionary nature of the virus is emphasized.
Co-virus coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes the single-stranded RNA positive-enzyme subfamily.
These pathogens comprise a large cluster of RNAs ranging from 26 to 32 of their own, which is why they are called CoVs which can be seen under a microscope.
In structure, CoVs have an undifferentiated genome that has a similar arrangement.
About two-thirds of the genome contain two large open subunits (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab copies of polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to form 16 unstructured proteins, which are encoded nsp1~16.
The other part of the base sequence contains ORFs for protein such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Most of the genetic variants are also enveloped by other CoVs.
Based on differences in the sequence of the virus, CoVs are classified into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is further divided into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Biological evidence suggests that bats and cetaceans serve as the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs
For thousands of years, CoVs have overcome the genetic barrier and some have emerged as important viruses for humans.
To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified in humans.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the lateral respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections and HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 infections generally cause mild symptoms such as influenza and diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are the most common infectious diseases that cause severe neurological damage in patients with a high risk of developing acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and other serious illnesses.
The first HCoV-229E variant, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with routine measles in the mid-1960s.
Since then, knowledge on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 has been gained through extensive study of the symptoms of the virus.
Indeed, the idea that infection with HCoVs was generally safe was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the worst outbreaks in recent history, infecting over 8,000 people with a fatal case rate of around 10%.
A decade later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused a regular epidemic in the Arab World with spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the agent of the developmental process of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin such as bats, rats or domestic animals.
A large body of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and are not pathogenic but exhibit high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenge to China and the world.
Analysis of the animal origin that induced HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the evolutionary history, the driving forces and the factors that inhibit cross-species transmission.
This may lead to or facilitate the detection of the pool, moderation and enhancement of the host (s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future recurrences.
In this workshop, we presented a brief overview of the zoonotic origins, their translocation between the species themselves and the architecture of HCoVs.
In particular, we are clarifying that the genetic basis of HCoVs is not that they evolved from a non-pathogenic organism after entering a different organism.
We also reviewed the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs in which an increase in transmission is often accompanied by a decrease in the host host population.
The outbreak is also described here for SARS-CoV-2.
Animal-derived CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of strain B814 of HCoV-229E from nasal swabs infected with the common cold, CoVs were isolated in various infected animals such as cattle, rabbits, cows, pigs, chickens and dogs.
In the past twenty years, a family of viruses related to HCoVs has been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV detection in the first series of this table (Table 1) will be satisfactory with the detailed information provided thereon.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from patients with respiratory infection and upper respiratory disease in 1966, and later received a wide distribution in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with the symptoms of the common cold, including headache, diarrhea, malaise, fever and sore throat, and fever and cough were observed in 10~20% of the patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of mouse pups.
The clinical features of infection with HCoV-OC43 are similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are characteristically differentiated from infections with other viral diseases such as influenza, bacteria and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are circulating worldwide, and are mainly transmitted in the spring, in climates that are not warm or cold.
In general, the incubation period of both of these infections is less than a week, which is followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
Based on human immunoassays, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have developed chronic cold.
A small number of patients with weakened immune systems show severe infectious pathways.
"SARS, also known as ""pneumonia virus"", is the earliest documented case of a virus-causing HCoV in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be identified".
The first SARS case was detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS virus has caused 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spread across several countries and continents.
Except for the major leopard, it is estimated that each strain can give approximately two weeks of symptoms, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a viral load manifested on day 10 of the illness.
Patients who are infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaria and severe cold, followed by dyspnea, cough and extreme stress as symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver function tests, and creatine kinase enhancement are common features of SARS testing.
Diffuse alveolar damage (damaged lungs), epithelial cell proliferation (growth of cells on the surface of the body), and an increase in macrophages (white blood cells) were found in SARS patients.
At least 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and ventilation.
After the respiratory tract is damaged, many internal organs, including the stomach, liver and kidneys can become infected in these severe cases, usually with cytokine-induced toxicity, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from a pneumonia cell collection of a relative of an Ebola patient who had travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, there have been efforts to study the HCoV virus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It has been found primarily in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illness.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and chills are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
An independent researcher has isolated a single virus from a nasal sample from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has probably spread worldwide.
The HCoV-NL63 gene is estimated to be responsible for at least 4.7% of respiratory infections, and is most prevalent in the spring, autumn and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the disease blocking bronchitis, also known as croup.
In one year, HCoV-HKU1 was first identified in a 71-year-old man who was rushed to hospital with pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary embolism, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing a small targeted infection.
All four of these HCoVs and the community have found a host in humans and generally lack the ability to mutate to cause disease in a highly pathogenic manner, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in most cases similar to HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe respiratory failure disease in China.
Overall, when these HCoVs are able to spread efficiently and maintain their general presence in humans, they also become less virulent or harmful.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Given that most of the confirmed cases are from the Middle East, the next two outbreaks to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by acute pneumonia.
However, unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed kidney disease, which is the main reason for differentiating MERS from HCoV-derived viruses.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory-confirmed infections had a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most virulent human diseases ever recorded.
In mid-December 2019, a number of patients with pneumonia, then thought to be similar to SARS-CoV-2, were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the emergence of a pandemic-like illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a major international public health challenge and has named the pandemic COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate due to infection of 3.4%..
In particular, the death rate from the disease in Hubei, China was 4.2 percent, while the rate outside was 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the symptoms of infection and can progress rapidly to severe respiratory illness.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the nucleotide sequence of the virus being 82%, they are classified into different branches in the genome tree.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is much lower, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to humans.
A newly reported SARS-CoV-2 strain may contribute to the rapid global spread.
Comparison and interchange of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals important similarities and differences.
Firstly, the incubation period and the incubation period of HCoVs are similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of the other six HCoVs.
The second is that the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is dependent on the interaction between the SARS-CoV virus and its four other variants: HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, infection with SARS-CoV-2 exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with HCoVs, which are commonly encountered by the general population, including the introduction of non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small incidence of severe COVID-19 infection can be seen as seen in SARS-CoV infection, however the incidence is much lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows signs of an interesting pattern of community-acquired HCoVs compared to SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of HCoVs that have been isolated by the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be established whether the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection is reduced after localization in humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, similar to other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by oral contact has played a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV will be further confirmed in future studies.
It is also of great interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed naturally as a community-based case of acquired HCoVs.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and later developmental transmission in humans will be influential on the outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak.
All four strains have found HCoVs that cause associated disease symptoms to be homologous to humans.
In a sense, it may be true that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
Alternatively, both could be from the life of the previous HCoV strain.
HCoVs that cause acute infections in humans and in people who have been infected with acute HCoV infection have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient degree to allow accumulation of mutations that would serve the purposes of the host restriction.
In this way, the longer the period of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it becomes well established, its transmission from person to person will be extremely difficult by means of quarantine or other measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
Over the years, four communities have found CoVs circulating in the population, causing a cold-like flu in the host population.
These germs do not need to be in the body of a human or animal.
In contrast, the pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
They need to survive in the bodies of their hosts in order to enter human bodies through one or more human beings and to obtain it from the animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and other HCoVs.
This is something that can be spread as widely as HCOVs infections in a community, at least in the time we are in.
However, it is more virulently infectious than the most commonly encountered HCoVs and less virulently infectious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be able to fully adapt to humans and move around within humans without a central shelter or central retention in animal bodies.
Before discussing the zoonotic origin of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and evolutionary, ecological, reservoir, intermediate and host developmental characteristics of HCoVs.
An animal that becomes an evolutionary refuge for HCoVs if it provides a close ancestral lineage that is primarily a sequence of nucleotide sequence.
The original virus is generally live-in and not invasive to its host.
Similarly, the HCoV-porting pool is continuous and long-lived.
In all cases, the co-infectors are naturally infectious and are the primary HCoV co-infectors or progenitors.
In contrast, if a new HCoV introduces a new host prior to or around its introduction to humans, it is not adapted to the new host and is typically pathogenic.
This is where the virus has its host, which can be the source of the infection and play an important role in allowing the virus to multiply where it can infect humans from there.
HCoV can be a terminal infection if it is unable to continue to spread in the host medium.
Unless it is a rare event, HCoVs can survive in a host and can cause serious effects that can take time to manifest.
Again, the one whose body was the last to be infected would be the one whose body was the original source of the infection.
Animal epidemiological data has revealed through regular review that the SARS case has a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that livestock traders had higher SARS-CoV IgG levels compared to the general population.
The flying civet (Paguma larvata) and racoon dog in the pet trade were the first to be found to carry viruses that are similar and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is directly supported by the fact that there have been no further reports of SARS after the killing of all the other Sivets animals in the markets.
However, it has been reported that civets from the wild or farms without exposure to live animal markets were not infected with SARS-CoV, which suggests that captive civets may only be a medium-sized host for SARS-CoV but not its host.
In particular, since 80% of the various animals in markets in Guangzhou are SARS-CoV-resistant and the possibility that many small mammal species may also be the medium of the SARS-CoV expansion cannot be excluded.
All of these were where the SARS-CoV virus was dying in their bodies.
Future studies for the animal host of SARS-CoV have identified a closely related CoV pathogen called SARS-Jemagen Rhinolophus CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-JemageCoV HKU3), which is present in the bodies of Chinese horses.
These bats contain SARS-CoV antigen and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 class genes.
This and other bat CoVs are 88-92% related by nucleotide sequence to SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new theory that bats are hosts of human diseases.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none if any that have been isolated WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human enzyme-modifying factor 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 gene derived from the monkey's backbone has been used in the monkey and cat and the human ACE2 as the gene receptors.
Interestingly, SARS patients who were recovering were able to decompose WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the original ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, matching the 95% nucleotide sequence homology stage.
However, there is a large system of correlation between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not an immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that the pathogen is not a direct descendant of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis of the MERS-CoV linkage to the same group of the CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 batches.
Both the bat Co-HKUV4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent and RNA-dependent gene sequences of MERS-CoV are similar to those of the European and African mosquitoes.
As of this writing, there is no evidence of MERS-CoV in the body of the monkey.
MERS-CoV and its similar bat CoV-HKU25 are 87% genetically similar.
So bats may not be the carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that monotonic strains are virally resistant to the MERS-CoV antibodies, similar to strains originating from the Middle East that are present in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV is the same virus found in humans that was isolated from the nasal cones of a single-headed camel, further suggesting that camels serve as a safe haven for MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that most mild symptoms but viral shedding were observed in test camels during MERS-CoV infection.
In particular, infected camels shed germs not only through respiration but also through oral-faecal secretion, which is also the main source of infectious diarrhoea from ticks.
However, questions remain since many MERS-infected individuals have confirmed that they had no history of contact with camels before developing symptoms, which are attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown pathways involving unidentified animal species that are infected with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bacterial CoV RaTG13 isolated from the virus affinis Rhinolophus.
As was the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a parental relationship.
The point is, the bat may not be a direct host for SARS-CoV-2 unless a near-identical future CoVs is found.
Presumably, the medium-sized animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the seafood market, to which many of the early COVID-19 concerns are related, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission of the disease.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a small group of endangered mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may be carriers of ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes are composed of genomes 85-92% of molecular nucleotide structure homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are related to RaTG13 with about 90 percent reduction in basal at the nucleotide level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like viral domains in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identification of the amino acid sequence origin.
However, the rate of replacement of RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is about one million times higher than that of the host.
A previous study on infected pangolins also reported the detection of viral traces from lung samples, which were similar to those associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various methods of linking the guide to produce a genome sequence that comprises about 86.3% of the complete bacterial genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the animals that is infected with SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin hybrid SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and beta-CoVs.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to bats and pangolins and other primates has been a topic of debate.
Whereas the highest sequence of genes was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RaTG13 were found to have the highest sequence of genes.
It is widely suspected that the high degree of role similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoV-beta and SARS-CoV-2 is caused by a mutation in the gene.
The finding is consistent with the recombination between SARS-CoV-2 encapsulated beta-CoV and RaTG13 in third-generation wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is highly transmissible among beta-CoVs.
The deterministic hypothesis is still based on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Excluding the case of HcoVs from animal origin, the strains HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
Animal biological evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from leprosy CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mice.
It has been reported that a mosquito CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in three-banded bats in North America has been found to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is closely related to another CoV strain, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, while the mouse is suspected as its co-occurrence.
For clarity, the current knowledge on the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic studies have provided evidence for the occurrence of HCoV-transmitted cases throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the genus to infect humans from domestic animals in 1890, a respiratory epidemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E infection is not very clear.
The virus was identified from the bat CoVs that closely resembles the HCoV-229E virus.
Among them is the alpha-alpaca-CoV.
There is ample evidence that the disease spread from the bacteria directly to humans.
Initially, humans but not almasses could interact with bats in the classification of ecology.
Instead, people are drawn to the alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E combined with the al-CoVs is heterogeneous and disorganized in bats, while Alpha-CoV caused a slow outbreak in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility that HCoV-229E evolved from a human CoV gene cannot be ruled out.
In fact, mosquitoes are the direct source of human pathogens that include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that viruses can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
In other words, while alpha-CoVs act as the source of the HCoV-229E strain, alpacas and sea lions can be the intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has been a prominent example of transmission of communication from bats to mammals and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the time of its initial discovery and received further confirmation from subsequent studies.
It is clear that bedbugs are carriers of diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.
Long periods, densely packed colonies, social proximity and the ability to fly are all conditions that make bats an excellent 'spreader of pathogens'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary mice for many years.
It is suitable for these camels that have gone from a pleasant medium to a guarded and naturally behaved stable.
MERS-CoV causes mild infection and maintains a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its transmission to humans has been accidental and all humans are where the MERS-CoV virus can no longer spread as a result of its inability to do so.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Specifically, pangolin beta-CoVs are the most commonly encountered pathogen in pangolins.
They may be the last refuge for related SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoVs, similar to the animal civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possible trans-species transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be ruled out or confirmed in future studies.
First, bats may be the main branch of the parasite associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus almost identically to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can pollute the environment with bats by slaughtering meat or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the expansion intermediates introduced by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans are infected with the virus through the slaughter and eating of animal flesh.
It is likely that most mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for further research on domestic and wild animals for the protection of the body.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation with SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species related to bats and pangolins.
The investigation of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the differences in animal-infected viruses, there are three other important aspects of the disease in the cross-reactivity of CoVs from their inhibitors.
First, their number is altered in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA molecules, the estimators of the replacement rate of CoVs can be considered as Medium to Low with the average active replacement rate being ~10-4 replacements per year per site 2, depending on the receptivity of CoVs to the host material.
CoVs have a characteristic exoribonuclease rearrangement, a deletion that results in a highly complex and poor or non-sustainable response.
Interestingly, the original genome of the virus that normally binds the CoV virus is bound to the chemical RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the first SARS-CoV-2 antibody candidates to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the replacement rate of CoVs is more than a million times higher than that of their host army.
In addition, the rate of mutation tends to be higher when CoVs are incompatible with their host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation for humans.
He may have already been acquainted with a person who lived with a contagious disease.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is compatible with single-celled camels.
In principle, it is not necessary that the molecular sequence can produce both ineffective and rapidly effective vaccines and immunizations against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the RNA gene in the CoVs demonstrated the genetic basis for mutation and alteration, which further led to their cross-species distribution which helped to allow the emergence of the novel CoVs when they were ready for the desired form.
This is supported by the abundance of specific open reading disks and the use of protein coding through the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, Covs can alter the body's response to repeatedly broken down RNA through specific sequences.
In the host cell, translocation occurs frequently during CoV RNA replication.
Continuous full-length sequencing of genomic segments of recombinant RNAs to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of genetic origin from the genome has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in zoonotic CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Infectious diseases by their location and their mode of transmission.
In addition to the three factors mentioned above about the virus, interaction of the virus with the host host is another factor that affects the spread between the genes.
Here, SARS-CoV is again included as a common example, which also demonstrates a strong selective nature during interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative test between the human and civet strains of SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be able to rapidly adapt in different shelters, especially with mutations in the S-type RBD protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of the CoV interacts with the host cell and the martini of the immune system.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510th amino acid position on the S1 subunit, which binds to human ACE2 as well as binds to the receptor for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civet, rats and raccoon mice, which allows for inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acids have been observed to be different from human and viral civet proteins isolated in RBD and 4 of them are in the receptor complex to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The animal SARS-CoV Sivet has the K479N and S487T mutations in RBD, which may increase the affinity of the protein for binding with the human ACE2 receptor.
In short, these amino acid substitutions may be very important for the bacterial metabolism in the human body.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein suggests that the S protein's endogenous relationship with the human ACE2 may be altered.
Indeed, cryo-EM studies show a 10 to 20 times higher correlation of this mutation than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to know whether any other host will be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with an S subunit.
There are other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may be responsible for successfully modulating the availability of these CoVs in humans after transmission of the strain from their animal hosts.
In addition to the host cell, the resulting interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-dependent and restriction factors.
The distribution of these proteins between humans and the genotypic strains of HCoVs such as bats, camels and rats may be a barrier to interactive transmission.
HCoVs must overcome their reliance on shelter and overcome their shelter constraints to successfully spread between different species.
In this regard, the genetic breakthroughs in this important area of interaction between the virus and its host remain to be identified and can be identified.
The detection of the anomalous state of the dependence of the shelter and the restraining factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology may be useful.
HCoV outbreaks: Back to zero by the end of the year
The mutation of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of new and different HCoVs.
Based on this argument, the malaria-causing CoVs are the source of infection for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and recombination also drives the evolution of HCoV and serves as two important steps in this process.
For example, the loss or loss of a single-cell protein has the potential to alter the viral genome in some way.
Of the proteins of the SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important in its compatibility with humans, as SARS-CoV-associated bat virus has been isolated but chemically diverse from the ORF8 protein.
29 genetic fragments from the SARS-CoVs genome were identified in the blood during the initial identification of the disease in humans.
This cleavage enters ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutation that promotes the shelter-transition.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with the alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of crawling regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recycling sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV outbreak has had a number of cross-breeding events, occurring in single-celled organisms in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recurrent mutations have also been observed in some HCoVs, in which HCoVs have recombined with other animal CoVs in unstructured genomes.
It should also be warned that human selection may contribute to unexpected changes in genes, perhaps caused by the facilitation of selection by extreme selection, such as the immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of the ORF4 complement length in the HCoV-229E sample cell, resulting from the deletion of two nucleotides.
While positive ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses that are related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca camel alpha-CoV exhibits a single nucleotide, resulting in a frameshift mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoirs.
An indicator of infection or symptoms is detected when the worms are infected with CoVs, indicating a correlation between CoVs and the worms.
It explained that the bats are the genetic material of CoVs and monitor their physiology and how their organs function.
For example, defects in the anti-inflammatory response discs in bats should reduce the infectivity of CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of the killer genes in bats is impaired by the elevated inhibitor of the killer NKG2/CD94 and the low expression levels of the major class I blood-thinning complexes.
Furthermore, the high reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from bat bacterial activity can suppress CoV replication and affect readings by receptor-transferase, thereby creating selective pressure for highly reactive viral strains when introduced into a new host.
Similarly, pathogenic CoV infections can mutate by replication, which causes the protein or protein-coding gene to be rejected.
Thus, it is not unlikely that three HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are neither pathogenic nor cause minor symptoms in infected populations such as mice and rats.
They can spread widely without triggering the host's immune system.
Here is the secret of why the asymptomatic are seen and what causes the severe complications in human infection.
The symptoms are caused by the body's immune system trying to fight the disease, which if overwhelmed can also have a serious impact on the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic individuals, the immune response has been lower for the spread of Cov.
The same approach to isolated linkage of the immune response may have useful results in anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be considered useful.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 in bats is harmful.
In this context, the life of the NLRP3 gene and its conjugate with MCC950 will have an impact on the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 followed the sequence of events in which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
Whereas a beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also the existence of a bacterium-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Given that live animals and other animals in markets have been found to be infected with SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoVs may have contributed false fragments to the final form of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally introduced into humans.
CoVs have returned to prominence as a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other primates have shifted our thinking about the importance of the source of infection by HcoVs being animal-derived rather than human-transmitted.
Considerable evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of bacterial origin and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV virus originated from human-animal contact in markets, closing wet markets and killing off occasional urban populations could end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reasons, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal-to-human transmission, considering the finding of the detection of the origin of the disease in many pangolins from beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals is yet to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV is present in the Arabian camel.
These camels are not only an important means of transportation but also a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local people.
They are everywhere in the Middle East and Africa.
Thus, it is almost impossible to cancel all camels in order to contain MERS, as was done in the wildlife market in China to contain the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To halt the spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine for MERS-CoV for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these pathogens, new pathogens may emerge that can cause infectious diseases.
Most zoonotic CoVs are transmitted in the wild.
For example, the viruses that originated from animals are viruses.
There is a growing body of evidence that CoVs coexist with and mutate into CoVs that infect humans rapidly and may become deadly in the future.
The practice of eating wild game should be abandoned in some parts of China to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Considering the prevalence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, it is important to be prepared for the outbreak.
In fact, many germs have existed on earth for a long time.
They remain in their original storage rooms until they can be propagated.
Although bats have many features that are more effective in spreading germs, the chance that humans may come into contact with bats and other wildlife species could be reduced if people are trained to keep them at bay.
Continued monitoring in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the biology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
The most effective way to prevent the transmission of animal diseases to humans is for humans to avoid these animals that carry the pathogen.
Many aspects of the show about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see what conditions bats and pangolin species could coexist in the same environment.
Secondly, if the bacteria play a significant role in transmitting the disease to humans, how can a person's contact with the bacteria be confirmed?
Third, if the third mammal is to be a true intermediate host, how it interacts with species including humans, bats and pangolins must be clarified.
Finally, the observation that most mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection should be investigated.
Whether it is a monkey, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent organisms that are nearly identical will be detected in its natural habitat in the future.
Further research in this area will allow for an evolutionary pathway for SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
COVID-19 testing protocols are being updated for suspected cases and for those who have already been diagnosed with the disease
On 6 February 2020, our organization published a rapid-response guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guidance provides us with our expertise and offers a broad reflection on the fight against this global disease.
However, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are slowly increasing based on the ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategy is also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we provided a single response to our guidance and provided a new diagnostic case of suspected disease and positive disease based on the latest findings of the COVID-19 Control Guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid recommendation guide and this was published online in the Military Health Academic Review on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our expertise and knowledge is gradually increasing based on advanced research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Review of Research and Treatment Standards for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, released seven publications in total with some contexts being significantly changed.
Now that our leadership has received feedback through Zhou et al., they have proposed a simple model based on clinical experience.
Their works add new evidence for our guidance and give a meaningful meaning to this earthly scene.
We are proud of their important work and express our appreciation for them.
However, their work also needs to be updated in light of the new Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seven Stage Test) and the latest trends.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to establish a suspected need requires combining any one item of epidemiological data with two items of clinical manifestations to make a full diagnosis, or requires combining three items of clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
History of infections: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and its surroundings, or other communities where COVID-19 infection has been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 skin infection (with a valid nucleic acid test);(3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and its surroundings, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms;(4) history of contact with a collection of confirmed cases ((≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory infection occurred in 2 weeks in a small area, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory tract infection symptoms; (2) with technical symptoms of infection with COVID-19; (3) total white blood cell count that indicates normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count in the early stage.
Confirmed case investigations should be based on suspected cases with any single pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) a genuine PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a rapidly circulating photo or video of any organism showing high affinity for known coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of SARG-CoV-2-IgG specific IgG from negative to positive, or a titer rising ≥4 times during recovery which is above critical period.
We can see that the actual PCR test for nucleic acid levels in the respiratory system or blood samples were added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) rounds.
The blood cell count was increased in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was increased to the seventh edition.
These modifications have been linked to researchers advancing the practice of rapidly testing for a valid antibody, and samples from respiratory cells including blood samples, which has improved the production of various products, and supports the production of specific antibody effects.
Besides, there is much more evidence that reminds us to be vigilant with both the terminally ill patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. classification should be updated, as they classify a person without clinical signs such as "low risk".
It is also necessary to ensure a system of progress evaluation in clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we would like to add some more direct evidence that comes with inviting readers to share their opinions.
For the diagnosis of undetected and detected diseases, we recommend that you identify and adhere to the latest national guidelines.
Our organization will also update our guidance to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the most in a single day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) released the latest tally of cases, which included 114 confirmed cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying home.
The death toll was recorded at 17.
In online news, IEDCR Director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two of the confirmed cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was 41-50 years old.
She also said that two of the infected were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic as of 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu news agency, a local news channel that one of the dead was Jalal Safur Rahaman, the director of the Bengal anti-corruption agency, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The closure of this public transportation started on 26 March and was extended to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods, medicine, fuel and food supplies is still permitted.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on 8 March in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus had exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been recorded from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This victory came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus case and Zambia reported its first coronavirus death.
North Korea claimed on Thursday to be one of the few countries that has been completely free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the last twenty-four hours as of 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the U.S. more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases have been recorded which are associated with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports from John Hopkins University that there were over 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday due to the coronavirus.
Worldwide, local governments have announced measures to contain the virus to prevent its spread.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the curfew until May 1.
On the ground, President Vladimir said he would continue to pay salaries without the nation going to work until April 30.
Portuguese lawmakers voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was defeated by 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to extend the curfew, previously, only between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand attempted to enforce a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the curfew until May 1.
Shops in Australia have reduced toilet paper for every transaction
On Saturday and Sunday, Woolworths and Coles in Australia limited the number of tickets to one or two per customer at one or more of its stores across the country.
THEY are all in one line, on Monday
The rules are posted on the exit wall and the store's Facebook page.
Reports suggest that shoppers have been clutching up stores due to COVID-19 fears and taking the single-step quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths bought a small amount of toilet paper to deliver one packet home for each order.
These changes follow the four-pack restriction or any transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 report, said that the fourth phase of the lockdown saw the number of stores selling goods within an hour of the unloading, and called for the lockdown to be ignored and ALDI in a post on his Facebook page on Tuesday called it unprecedented.
Business rose rapidly last week, according to Woolworth's spokesman.
Costco's Canberra store has reduced sales to zero for the past two weeks.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI signed stock for a special Wednesday program to begin early.
Russell Zimmerman, president of the Association of Motor Vehicle Dealers, said that the major dealers are trying to increase the quantity of their vehicles, but local regulations on the timing of their importation are making it difficult.
He expects to receive higher processing costs in an attempt to meet similarly high demands.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the initial stock release, some stores would not be able to hold the Wednesday special.
In News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a small business expert from the University of Queensland, reports that the stores are filling up with customers every night.
He says that toilet paper is a big deal, which makes the goods scarce, and if all the goods are sold, the stockpiles are left empty, which makes the shortage even worse.
"""Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion [that] if there are many products on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and cleaning supplies [are] there and in abundance, perhaps the panic will be reduced"" said Russell Zimmerman in ABC News".
The toilet paper recycler who supplied the Crap said last Wednesday they would run out.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, have stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some agents were offering free tickets to first-time bidders at the auction in Melbourne, when the auction was held in a small way because the buyers had gone on holiday over the Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of the NT newspaper contained eight pages that had to be cut down for use as a newspaper.
Shops initially showed a lack of response from the start of the crisis, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March which said there was no plan to cut down on the sales.
Russell Zimmerman added other items that were needed urgently, including face protection, hand soap, clothes dryers, hand sanitizer, and even flowers.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was noted that the British online shopping site Ocado was limiting the sale of Andres toilet bowl to two packs of 12 ounces.
COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak and the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2 to be a pandemic.
Although the term "anoba" refers to the extent of the disease's spread, not the severity of the disease, WHO urged governments to intervene in the fight.
All the countries of the world can still change the shape of this epidemic.
If countries can detect, test, treat, diagnose, and send their people to aid,  said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director of WHO.
""We are deeply concerned about both the level of violence and the spread of the virus and the level of anxiety"."
According to Dr Tom Frienden, former Chairman of the National Cancer Institute, the epidemic is unknown.
He said, in a speech published by CNN in February, "without the flu, no other respiratory virus has risen from the brink of global pandemic".
Ghebreyesus also testified adding that there had never been an epidemic caused by the coronavirus before.
"He went on to say, ""and we have never seen an epidemic that can be controlled in one go""".
The new pandemic status follows the decision of the WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of The United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""In the end, it will be worse"".
The Associated press currently reports that the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide has reached 126,000 and 4,600 people have died from the infection.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic caused by the 2019 COVID-19 infection caused by 2 SARS-COV-2.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and was confirmed as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.61 million people have been infected with COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 were cured.
The estimated mortality rate is 4% in China, and globally the rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
The main symptoms of the disease include fever and cough with shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory infections.
The period from the onset of the disease to the onset of symptoms is about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or treatment for it.
Primary care includes providing emergency shelter, protective measures including hand washing, masking during dancing, providing social distancing for the sick, and monitoring and quarantining of people who are suspected or suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by adopting measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, compliance with workplace safety regulations and factory closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global economic turmoil, the cancellation or suspension of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the supply of goods that leads to panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either in whole or in part in 193 countries, affecting at least 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misunderstandings about the virus have spread online, and there are sometimes racist comments and prejudice against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people and their appearance, and others from areas with significant infection rates.
As a result of the travel ban and the closure of major industries there was a shortage of air pollutants.
Health officials in Wuhan reported that the outbreak was first detected by a viral pneumonia on 31 December 2019 and that an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases are associated with the aquarium trade in Huanan so the disease is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified virus is related to gemage coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The person first identified with symptoms of the disease was later diagnosed with the disease on 1 December 2019, and the person was not clearly related to the previous case group cough.
Of the first reported cases in December 2019, two-thirds were identified as market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case had started on 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, possibly the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, while new cases were reported in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases in China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
A high incidence is likely, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, there was no shortage of cases among adolescents, who were 19 years old and below, and who accounted for less than 2.4% of the global total.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected before a successful vaccine could be developed.
The trend shows the number of people who have undergone COVID-19 testing and whose test results show that they have the disease based on official evidence.
As of 23 March, no country had conducted more than 3% of the tests and most countries have received official guidance on testing even those with no symptoms. countries include Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that, in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were reported, and these unrecognized infections were the source of 79% of infections as documented.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than reported.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
Research published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the monthly average is 5.7.
Most people who have COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time from symptom to death was between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020 the estimated number of COVID-19-related deaths was 97,000.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of the deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had a medical condition including heart disease and diabetes.Contagion and primary mortality from COVID-19 generally refers to people who have died who tested positive for COVID according to official guidelines.
The expected death rate from COVID-19 is likely to be higher as there are more deaths of people who have not been tested for COVID-19 such as those at home and those in residential care.
A section of the Italian data found the death rate during the outbreak exceeded the COVID death rate by 4-5x.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the reported number of deaths] is alarmingly high"", a statement based on confidential reports of events in the United States.Such ignorance often occurs in natural disasters, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy, ahead of China.
On March 13, more than 40 countries and regions announced the deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and time period, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of healthcare, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and social characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. it shows the number of deaths divided by the number of diseases detected during a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate was 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The figures vary from region to region.
In China, estimates of the mortality rate have been reduced from 17.3% (for those who were symptomatic from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who were symptomatic from 1 February 2020). Other measures include a mortality measure that shows how many people who were treated for a disease died. There is also a mortality measure that shows how many people (who were treated for a disease) died as a result of the disease.
These estimates are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection by randomization.
Many of the scholars have tried to figure out the statistic of a certain segment of the population.
The Oxford University Evidence Centre estimates that the overall prevalence rate of the virus is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The main statistics of this range are consistent with the results from the initial COVID-19 testing in Germany, and with statistical studies that analyze the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO confirms that the epidemic can be controlled.
The severity and frequency of the symptoms are not certain and may vary from place to place.
Maciej Bony from Penn State University explained that if left unchecked the epidemic would escalate and then begin to decline as the disease loses the body on which it can live.
But it is almost impossible to make any prediction as to when this will be.
China's top health adviser Zhong Nashan believes that the end of the outbreak is likely in June if the international community follows the WHO recommendations to contain the spread of the virus.
"On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 ""will circulate in the continents, probably for a year or two more"."
"According to the Imperial College of Science Research Chaired by Neil Ferguson, Public Inhibition and Other Measures will be extended until a vaccine is available (at least 18 Months or more) "
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus - because it is so easily transmitted - will go away completely"" and that """"it may be a modern disease, which comes back every year"".
The severity of the virus is related to the body's immune response and the body's genetic makeup.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The most common symptoms of the disease are fever (88%) and dry skin (68%).
Some of the minor symptoms include fatigue, phlegm, loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, joint and body pain, sore throat, headache, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO reports that about one in six people who become ill have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, painless awakening, and facial or lip pain; emergency medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure, heart attack, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical signs but with test results confirming infection, so researchers recommend that those in close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and screened for possible infection.
The Chinese estimate of the total symptom-free population ranges from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset) ranges from one to 14 days; the most common is five days.With uncertainty, the estimated incidence of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell and smell starts at 30% and then drops to 15%.
Some of the details of how the disease is spread are being investigated.
There is a risk of transmission initially through contact with the host and then through droplets received during coughing or sneezing or talking and having a close contact with a person of between 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an uncovered cough can cause a cough that can travel 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may be spread by water droplets that remain in the air for a long period of time and then be transmitted through oral transmission. Similarly, respiratory droplets may be produced when a person breathes in air from outside or while speaking. The original route of transmission was not limited to the airway.
The dough can fall on the mouth or nose of someone nearby and can even be rubbed into the sink.
Some of the most common and safe ways such as the installation of a ventilation system and cardiac resuscitation can be used to transmit airborne illness.
It can also be spread by touching contaminated objects, including skin, and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While the infection may occur through a highly contagious organism, the risk is extremely low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 infection through the saliva to the mouth.The virus has been spreading for more than three days with no symptoms but there is a possibility of transmission before symptoms appear or before it crosses into the second stage of infection.
After testing, people were found to be infected for up to three days before symptoms appeared.This indicates that there is a possibility of infection before symptoms appear.
While few laboratory reports confirm the severity of the condition, the severity of the outbreak has been confirmed in some countries during the epidemiological and epidemiological studies.
The European Centre for Disease Control has announced that one person can spread the virus to two or three others, and the virus can affect people in the open for days.
Specifically, the virus was detected for up to three days on polypropylene and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies depending on the weather and temperature.Pets and other animals were found to be positive for COVID-19 after testing.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British Council recommends hand washing after contact with animals and other areas that may be contaminated.
SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that is a viral strain.It was first isolated from three patients with severe acute respiratory pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
All variants of this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are derived from the same coronavirus family in their natural environment.In the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which inhibits the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is associated with the Betacoronavirus genome, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (genus B) with two bacterial strains found.
96% more accurate in one direction during the construction of the test cell compared to the Bat coronavirus specimen (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered a hallite gene in the liver that links the virus to the human immune system.
A comparison of the genetic material of the virus found that the coronavirus pangolin was 92% identical to SARS-COV-2.This does not confirm pangolin as an intermediate host.
Diagnosis of viral infection can be done on a symptomatic basis, although final confirmation is by infection-specific reverse transcript polymerase reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT scan.
A study combining PCR and CT in Wuhan suggested that CT has a faster response to PCR, despite the short duration, than most other types of influenza and other infectious diseases.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used as a screening test or as a preliminary test for the diagnosis of COVID-19"".
The WHO published the test methods for SARS-COV-2 viral viral haemorrhage, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) recording.
A breathalyser test or even a blood sample may be done.
The effects are usually felt within a few hours to a few days.
This test is usually performed on a nasopharyngeal swab although a throat swab may be used.Most laboratories and companies perform serological tests, which detect the bacteria.
As of 6 April 2020, this has not been confirmed to be the case in the current outbreak.
In the U.S. a serological test developed by Cellex is approved and safe for emergency use in an approved laboratory.
Simulated patterns of imaging behavior in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical lower eyelids and uncomfortable features.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an online database of radiological findings for confirmed cases worldwide.
As a result of cross-infection with other viruses such as adenovirus, a virus without PCR confirmation is not limited to specific detection of COVID-19.
A leading study in China compared the results of chest radiography with those of genetic imaging where it found a lack of real-world imaging of the virus.It found that the virus spread faster and more safely and recommended the replacement of the test method in areas of high epidemic prevalence.
Human artificial intelligence networks are designed to detect viral patterns with radio imaging and CT scans.
Preventive measures include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, coughing or sneezing into a paper bag and placing the paper in a trash can.
Those who have been previously infected with the virus are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Social distancing is one of the measures taken to control the spread of the disease.Most national governments have recommended restricting travel to and from affected countries.
The virus has reached epidemic proportions in parts of the world.
This indicates that the virus is spreading in the community, and some local populations do not know how or where they have been infected. Healthcare workers who care for patients are advising those who are infected to use precautions, contact precautions, eye protection. Tracing contacts of patients is an important way for health authorities to identify the exact source of the virus and prevent it from spreading.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing statements calling for an end to such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or introduced for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, several expert groups are working on private networks, such as using Bluetooth to get into the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users receive a message that if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, misunderstanding is spreading about how to protect against infection; for example, nose-washing and even mouthwash do not protect against infection.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 and no groups are trying to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands whenever they are in contact with soap for at least one minute, especially after they have eaten a meal or if their hands are dirty; immediately after touching the face, mouth, or hair.
This is because outside the body the virus can be killed by soap, the soap breaks the protective pigment.
The CDC also recommends using a hand sanitizer containing 60% alcohol if no soap or water is available.
WHO recommends people to keep their eyes, nose and mouth clean without washing their hands.
Bacteria can be washed off the surface with a number of treatment methods (within one minute of exposure to a stainless steel corrosive), including 62-71 percent ethanol, 50-100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5 percent povidone-iodine.
Other antibiotics such as Benzalkonium chloride and Chrohexidine have less potent effects.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an office such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, key fobs, remotes, and ATM machines used by patients, should be decontaminated.
Health organizations have advised the public to cover their mouth and nose by folding their elbows or using a hand sanitiser while coughing or sneezing and to ensure that the toilet is disposed of promptly afterwards.
The use of surgical face masks is recommended for those who may have been infected, as wearing a mask may reduce the frequency of outward transmission during speech, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use face masks.
According to the University of Leeds's virologist Stephen Griffin, wearing face masks reduces the risk of hand-to-mouth contact, which is one of the main ways of contracting the disease, especially if the hands are not washed properly.  It is also recommended that face masks be used by patients who have the infection.
WHO recommends wearing a face mask for healthy people if they are among the most vulnerable, for example those caring for COVID-19 patients, although they acknowledge that wearing a face mask may help people avoid touching their faces.
Many Countries Have Started Promoting the Use of Face Protection for Members of Their Populations.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric.China specifically recommends the use of disposable masks by healthy public representatives, especially if they are in close proximity (1 meter (3 ft) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong mandated the wearing of face masks when entering public transportation and in public gatherings.
Thai health officials are increasingly encouraging people to wear masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without wearing a face mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam required everyone to wear a face mask when entering public areas to protect themselves and others in the community.
The Australian government has ordered that anyone entering a grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel orders its residents to wear face coverings in public.
Taiwan, which has issued nearly 10 million face shields since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and bus rental cars to wear face shields from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any national while outdoors.It recommends that traditional masks be controlled if there is no trend to buy the original model.
The use of face masks is restricted in Japan, South Africa, Malaysia, Korea and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control practices that are aimed at reducing the spread of the disease by limiting the physical contact between people.
They have threatened isolation, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, parks, and stadiums, sports arenas or shopping malls.
Many people can take advantage of social distancing measures by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding crowded areas, using uncontacted greetings, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in areas where the virus is active.
The maximum number of people gathered by U.S. government agencies and health groups was quickly reduced to 250 (if there was no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50, and then to 10.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public contact with more than two people.Adults and those with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems were at increased risk of infection and complications and were advised by the CDC to stay indoors throughout the pandemic.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", to clarify that the goal is to reduce the amount of physical contact while in quarantine, whether in close quarters or in close quarters".
The concept of "communication harassment" has captured the public's imagination and has been widely adopted without regard to the interaction with the public in any other way. Authorities have delivered effective sexual health policies during the pandemic.
This includes the recommendation to have sex with someone who is in the same environment as them and who has not been diagnosed with the virus or symptoms.
Patients with coronavirus infection are advised to isolate at home along with those suspected to have COVID-19 infection.
Health authorities have provided details of how to effectively isolate.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-isolation for all populations living in affected areas.
Stricter quarantine orders were issued for those in extreme danger.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last symptom.
The strategies involved in managing an outbreak are containment, prevention, and mitigation.
Efforts are being made to reduce the spread of the outbreak in the early stages with the aim of identifying and isolating those infected as well as implementing other infection control and prevention measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are then moved to the phase of mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread of the disease and its impact on health systems and society.
Preventive and mitigation measures can be implemented simultaneously.
Containment requires more stringent measures to reverse the disease by reducing the baseline fertility rate to below 1.Infection management and outbreaks attempt to reduce the spread of the disease, known as curbing the course of the disease.
This reduces the risk of healthcare work being delayed and allows more time for immunization and treatment.
Non-medicinal precautions that can prevent the outbreak include personal protective measures, such as, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; public distancing measures such as closing schools and preventing large gatherings; community engagement to encourage the adoption and management of such precautions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.Highly targeted actions have been taken to reduce the outbreak in China when the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining all cities and enforcing travel curfews.
Other countries have also taken a number of external measures to limit the spread of the disease.
South Korea introduced mass testing and home quarantine, with a warning about the groups of infected.
Singapore has provided financial support to those affected by the quarantine who have self-quarantined and imposed heavy penalties on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increases face coverings and punishes those who wear healthcare products.The UK and US measures have shown that the situation (low infection rate but no spread control) and the situation (reversal of infection) are very problematic.
The reduction of the disease burden could lead to a reduction in health care needs by 2/3 and mortality by half.It could also lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of people with over-utilized health care systems.
The suppression phase is used for as long as the virus is circulating in the human body (or until a vaccine is available) because the transmission can change the pattern of the suppression phase.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the disease has a social and economic cost.
There is no proven treatment for COVID-19 but it is still being tested in existing clinical trials and controlled therapies.
Taking medication and taking a lot of sleeping pills with rest may help reduce the severity of the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy and hydrotherapy may be required along with ventilation.
The use of steroids can aggravate the effects.
Several compounds that have been approved for the treatment of other common diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO added that some traditional medicines may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
The development and delivery of healthcare systems to meet the needs of patients with COVID-19 was a major emergency as defined by the WHO.
ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidance to hospitals and primary healthcare services to switch resources at several levels, including switching from laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling routine procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and improving intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the availability of ventilators and beds.
There are many theories about where the disease started (the origin of the carrier) from which it originated.
The first known case of the Coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These are often associated with the Huanan Wildlife Market, which also sells live animals, and another theory is that the disease comes from one of the animal species; or, in short, has a zoonotic origin.A cluster of unidentified pneumonia was observed on 26 December and identified by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed colleagues of the SARS-like coronavirus.
The police arrested eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and her other senior officer, Ai Fen, reprimanded her for the alarm.
The Wuhan Regional Health Authority later issued a public statement on 31 December with a report to WHO.
Several undetected cases were reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubling as much as every seven and a half days in short.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, using New China and Wuhan as transportation hubs and major railway interchanges.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later data showed 6,174 people with symptoms of the disease as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
There is at least one person infected in 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, the Powers and Freedoms under the Schenghen Agreement have restricted movement to provide for border control.
National considerations include measures to reduce the spread of the disease such as quarantine (i.e. orders to stay home, evacuation, or even lockdown) and even emergency measures.As of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people were under lockdown in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people were under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were under lockdown in India.
As of 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people in two days - almost a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 was detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; in an unconfirmed report, the first case was reported on 17 November.

In 24 of China's 31 provinces, districts and regions, the authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10 with orders for restaurants to remain closed until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the national economy i.e. GDP and foreign trade 90%.
Hong Kong has raised its response to the pandemic to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.The global economy has been affected, with many stores cutting their hours or closing temporarily.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The North American and Middle Eastern markets saw a 50-60% drop.
This has resulted in a decrease in pedestrian traffic at shopping malls from 33% to 43% between February and March.
Retail operators around the world have imposed more measures, such as increased hygiene, the installation of freezer screens to check the temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of events.According to the United Nations Latin America Commission estimates, the outbreak has affected between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more than would have been the case without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, 5 million Chinese people lost their lives.
Many of the nearly 300 million Chinese migrant workers have either been stranded at home in the provinces or trapped in Hubei Province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The Coronavirus pandemic could cost 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to figures from the Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Lockdown in India has left tens of thousands of Indian immigrants (paid through regular wages) unemployed.The survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment.Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they entered into lockdown in mid-March 2020.
In mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for short-term unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for government support. Nearly a million German workers have signed up their employees to the government-backed short-term work programme known as Kurzbet.
France and Britain adopted the German short-term project model.
The cultural sector has faced challenges in this pandemic, with the movement of the Agency for Human Rights and Freedoms across the world.
The community organizations have tried to support as usual the creation of a community culture and to protect the health of workers and citizens while helping to provide recreation as much as possible.
In March 2020, around the world, museums, libraries, parks, and cultural sites were permanently closed and their symbols such as entertainment and celebrations were removed and dismantled.
In response there have been efforts to provide some services through digital platforms. Another new trend accelerating the end of the epidemic is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts and art fairs, and fashion shows.
The film industry is facing a collapse, the Vatican announced the religious week for the exhibition in Rome, which took place last week during the Christian season of Lent, as cancelled.
Many of the elders have advised elderly Christians to stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sunday; some churches have worshipped by radio, video-conferencing, or television while others have held a sermon in a car.
With the Roman Catholic Church in Rome closing its cathedrals and places of worship and St. Peter's Square to Christian protesters, other religious groups have also canceled services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, places of worship and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the affected mosques later, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the global sporting calendar since the Second World War.
Most of the tournaments were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
"The explosion of plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that ""the event will be rescheduled to 2020 but not beyond summer 2021"". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and domestic sporting events have been either rescheduled or suspended".
This has led to a resurgence of online gambling, with gambling sites increasing the number of new members.The same is true for the entertainment sector, where most clubs have restricted or cancelled their games.
Many venues such as the one on broadway have banned all the shows.
Some gaming communities have developed ways to share their games online instead of the traditional open-source game, instant video streaming and the creation of online stores for players to access and share their games.
The media has been flooded with coronavirus jokes and caricatures as many of them have turned their attention to entertainment to distract from the uncertainty of the end of the pandemic.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, discrimination, racism, and racism against Chinese and Middle Eastern people, as well as people from refugee camps in Europe, the United States and other countries, have been increasing.
The issues of fear, stigma, and protection have been faced in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and even the Pacific Rim.
Reports from February (when the number of cases was low in China) contained data on how the rest of the world was racially biased and insulted towards Chinese people.Many suggested that the country deserved the consequences it suffered.
Some parts of Africa have seen ethnic hatred against the Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported racial discrimination based on their local origin.
Chinese people are being supported, both online and offline, by those in the most affected areas.
Following the continued spread of the virus in several new countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may be subject to accusations of racism.  Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have begun signing petitions to ban Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is a hit on Twitter.
Chinese and some Asian people in Britain and the U.S. reported more racism, and other attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump Is Angry at the Coronavirus Being Called "Chinese Virus", a Term Used by Critics in the Face of Anti-Chinese Racism
Protesters in Ukraine attack vehicles carrying Ukrainian citizens and others trying to escape from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the Northeast of India who are studying in other Indian cities are facing a crisis due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus.
The Bharatiya Janata Party regional leader in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese have corrupted the culture and that this has caused God to take revenge on them.
" The Chinese Labor Federation later condemned the Kolkata speech as "erroneous". " In China, the outbreak of racism and racial profiling against Chinese residents did not occur as a result of the outbreak, where foreigners were described as ""foreign trash"" with the intention of ""excommunication"". "
Most newspapers have removed Wall Stories in all their reports except for the Coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have put scientific papers related to the outbreak in the public domain for anyone to read.
Some scientists have chosen to publish their results in time via the bioRxiv open access software.

The testing suite for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 infection includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and those that detect the immune genes generated as a result of infection.
RT-PCR is used to confirm the presence of bacteria in a sample, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specifically designed to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It is used to confirm the diagnosis of a disease that has been diagnosed or is in progress.
Serology is used in testing and surveillance of the general population.
An immunoassay reveals which people have been infected, even those whose symptoms have been reported to a lesser extent.
The presence of the disease and its cause in humans can be found in the test.
Due to the lack of testing, as of March 2020 no country has reliable data for the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and there were significant variations in the number of tests performed across countries.
This discrepancy may also affect the accuracy of the reported incidence of severe infection, which is likely to be higher than in other countries.
Using real-time translational polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the respiratory tract can be tested which is obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal translation or sputum sample.
results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing is also known as a throat swab but is only possible in the first week of infection.
The virus then spread to the lungs as it proliferates in the lungs.
For those who have been infected and tested in the second week, in addition, a sample of the respiratory tract can be taken using a catheter or a cough (sputum).
One of the PCR tests was developed at Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and designed a base of 250,000 items for distribution from the World Health Organization (WHO).
Europeans added a test on 23 January 2020.North Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a new, PCR-based SAR-CoV-2 test compound (Powercheck Corona virus) on 28 January 2020.
"It is looking for the ""E"" shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp specific viral gene for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Health Service for PCS-CoV-2 detection kits-In the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is distributing the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Time-Run RT-PCR Test to public health testing facility by the International Reagent Resource".
One of the test samples had a defect due to a compound problem and was on the CDD test bottle in Atlanta; this resulted in almost 100 samples that were correct as of February 2020.
The use of dual-testing has not been demonstrated to be effective until 28 February 2020, and until then states and laboratories will be allowed to conduct testing.
The trial received approval from the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Management category. a cost-effective laboratory in the US began the trial in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of a national COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics standardized nationwide COVID-19 test is available as of 9 March 2020
No maximum quantity is announced, samples collected and processed must be done in accordance with the CDC's requirements
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and administered by the State Research Institute of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the test was submitted to the Federal Service for Surveilance in the health sector.On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reported that a COVID-19 test protocol was available.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to conduct the test in a maximum of 3.5 hours, although they would allow the test to be performed in approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA granted the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute trial.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require any weather patterns the method can produce a positive result in five minutes and an uncertain result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these units in the US and Abbott expects to produce an additional 50,000 tests per day.A test containing a monoclonal antibody that destroys the nucleacapsid protein (N Protein) of the coronavirus nucleus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation that it will provide results in 15 to 20 minutes as in the case of influenza.
"A review of the March 2020 literature concluded that ""radiographs of the chest are not very valuable for diagnosis in the early stages, while CT [quantitative tomography] scans can be even pre-symptomatic. """
Common forms of CT include bilateral multilobara ground-glass opacificities and periheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
The disease is characterized by increased subpleural invasion, skin irritation and inflammation.
A PCR-to-CT test in Wuhan at the origin of the current outbreak has shown that CT is more infectious than PCR, although it is not as specific, and most of the viral techniques associated with certain lung infections and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT be avoided as a screening test for early COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended the use of PCR as a screening test".
The immune system's response to infection is the development of a complex immune system composed of IgM and IgG.
They can be used to identify people with infections that started at 7 days or later after the initial onset of the disease, for detection and prevention, and for surveillance of the population. Assays can be used in laboratory testing (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-throughput automated laboratory machines can perform these tests in many clinics but availability will depend on how much is available for each device.
For CLT a single lateral blood sample is commonly used, although blood samples can also be used routinely for the monitoring of immunization.
PoCT a single blood sample on a slit through a skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no pre-assay stage is required. On 26 March 2020, the FDA allowed 29 individuals to provide notification to the authorities as required and now have the authority to distribute their own immunoassay.
The FDA approved the test on April 7, 2020, under the use of an emergency authorization at the end of March 2020.Euriommum Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in a blood sample.
The size of the test has a number of sample cycles in hours and is much faster than the standard viral RNA PCR assay.
Antibodies can be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection.At the beginning of April, the UK had no antibody test kits available for purchase.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where those who are diagnosed with the virus stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they will be injected with a syringe, sent to them and the test results will be available later.The UK NHS has announced a first-stage test scheme for testing those who are diagnosed with the virus at home, which eliminates the risk of transmission of the virus from patients to others when they arrive at the hospital or by washing the virus from the car or ambulance that would have been contaminated if the test had been used.In the COVID-19 pandemic, the health department has been able to provide a sample of the virus using other protective measures".
The nearby testing facilities have enabled South Korea to provide rapid and cost-effective testing in every country.In Germany, doctors at the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance said on 2 March, that they have the capacity to perform 12,000 tests a day in the system and 10,700 were added last week.
The price to the insurer when the doctor orders the test.
According to the institute's director Robert Koch, Jamaus has the capacity to perform 160,000 tests a week.
From 19 March, a large number of tests were conducted in major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests performed in Germany is unknown, except for two confirmed cases.
"Preliminary laboratory analysis confirmed that in the week 12/2020 a total of 483,295 samples were tested up to and including the week 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9 percent) showed the presence of SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and conducted a test model for the testing of samples from 64 patients, by testing samples that only confirmed the presence of a complex sample.In Wuhan a 2000-sq-meter emergency laboratory called Huo-Yan (and Chinese: 火眼, or ""Fire Eye"" in short) was founded by the BGI on 5 February 2020, which can test about 10,000 samples a day".
With the building's superintendent BGI founder Wang Jian taking 5 days, the test showed a Hubei case rate of over 47% and the same cost of quarantine that would double the cost of a test where the rate was not online.
The Wuhan laboratory is followed by the Hou-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai in all 12 cities in mainland China.
As of 4 March 2020 all daily tests had reached 50,000.Origami Assays designed and released Open Source, Multilexed tests have been released for testing as many as 1122 samples of COVID19 using 93 assays without the need for robotic handlers.
In March, the scarcity and lack of test reagents prevented many tests in the EU and the UK and the US.
This prompted some authors to review the sample preparation process which included boiling samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to extract RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates had begun testing the coronavirus in its population more than any other country, and was working to increase the testing rate to reach the entire population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through, the purchase of population-scale mass-throughput testing equipment from 42 organizations and BGI (based on the Huo-Yan Chinese Test Laboratories).
Built in 14 days, the lab can handle ten thousand RT-PCR tests a day and is the first one operating outside China.
Various test kits for the coronavirus genome have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the U.S.
The World Health Organization adopted the German system of controlled experiments which were sent to low-income countries that lacked the raw materials to control their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; an agreement with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not reached until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. China and the United States had concerns about the reliability of test kits at the start of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia failed to provide enough kits to satisfy the demands and recommendations of health experts.
In addition, experts said the help of the large number of tests available in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
The test facilities, mostly independent laboratories were built over the years by the South Koiya Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization declared that testing is the most effective and efficient method for the COVID-19 pandemic.There is a high demand for vaccines due to the spread of the disease which has led to a slowdown in testing in U.S. laboratories and the availability of samples and test chemicals.
In March 2020 China reported a crisis affecting the quality of equipment.
In the United States, the test kit purchased from the CDC had problems and the government removed the blockade that prevented the commercial laboratories from operating.Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology co ltd and found that the results were invalid.
The company explained that the incorrect result could be due to failure to collect samples or use the product correctly.
The Spanish agency said it would remove the unsatisfactory product from the auction, and replace it with a different product called Shnghen Bioeasy 80% of the Czech Republic's test kits purchased in China had failed.Slovakia has purchased about 1.2 million test kits in China that had failed.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that it be stored in the Danube Ates Kara of Turkish health officials said the test kits that Turkey bought from China had many errors and were not used.The UK bought about 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 they said that these were not usable.
Testing, tracking and isolation of infected individuals and tracking of contacts of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2 virus who have been infected have been the most negative interactions leading to infection.
Researchers working in Italy's VO, where the first COVID-19 deaths were identified in Italy, conducted a series of tests on a total population of 3,400, almost ten days apart.
Almost half of the infected people do not show any symptoms of the disease and all those who are infected are quarantined.
The system of traffic controls, which completely eliminates some infections.
With tracking of contacts, domestic travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore is moving more slowly than in other developed countries, but there is no slowdown like the closure of canteens and warehouses.
All other activities were suspended, with Singapore issuing a stay-at-home order on 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March.
Many countries have prevented the spread of the disease by tracking contacts, restricting travel, testing and quarantining infected people, but not by restricting people's movement, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical analysis has shown that countries that have done more testing, in terms of mortality, have fewer cases, perhaps because those countries are better able to identify those with few or no symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries with limited testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send an initial five confirmed and ten untested COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratory-certified testing sites.
Of the 16 laboratory samples, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, 1 in Australia.
In the following graphs, the validity column as % of test is influenced by the national test system.
A country testing only hospitalized people would score highly as a % of all nationals tested, whether they showed symptoms or not, if all other factors remained constant.
Hand washing, also known as hand sanitizing, is a method of washing hands to remove dirt, grease, debris, or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap and ""Special Time"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera which are transmitted through oral secretions".
People can also catch pneumonia or the common cold if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
The five most important times of the day are when hand washing with soap is most important: before and after leaving the toilet, after giving a baby a bath and changing a child's napkin, before feeding a child, before eating, before and after cooking, and after touching a raw fish or farmhouse.
If soap and water are not available hand washing with ash is recommended by WHO:
Before, during, and after cooking.
before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child's toilet.
After a runny nose, cough, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal feed, animal bones, or animal tissue.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygiene of the work that involves medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of infection.
The primary purpose of hand washing is to remove microorganisms from the hands (pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who work in the food or health sector, but it is also important for society as a whole.
Hand washing is very effective in reducing influenza, coronavirus and other communicable diseases, preventing the spread of diarrhoea and decreasing the risk of respiratory infections.
And reduce the number of deaths of babies at home birth.
A 2013 study suggested that improper hand washing practices may lead to reduced growth in height and growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the number of infant deaths related to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing alternative routines such as hand washing with soap.
This simple step can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
The protection that adds the hand sanitizer can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in the poor.
48% of diarrhea reduction can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cheap way to prevent infection with malaria and pneumonia as it is done in schools, home and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main infectious agent of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, affecting approximately 1.8 million children annually.
Tuberculosis and pneumonia kill some 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet is a practice that can save more lives than any vaccine or drug, cutting the number of women by almost half and deaths from respiratory infections by one quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other water treatment processes as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) systems.
Hand-washing also helps to prevent the spread of infectious diseases (pestilence) that are transmitted by sexual contact.
A minor drawback to hand washing is that excessive hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dry skin.
In a 2012 study, it was found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, hand sweating is more common in healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five times when daily hand washing with soap is important to reduce the spread of infection to the face and mouth: after using the toilet (toilet, toilet), after changing a child's diaper (switching napkins), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other times when measures should be taken to prevent the spread of infection include before or after handling a cut or wound; after touching a skin or handling an animal; and after touching dirt.
In many countries handwashing with soap is in short supply.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest percentage of 97% of the state then the nearest middle-eastern country with 77% then China with the lowest 23%.[citation needed] Due to climate change there is an increase in the level of hand washing with soap at critical times.[citation needed] The hand washing of school children during the day is the only option in developing countries to put children's hand washing habits into practice.
"The "Essential Health Program" (EHP) implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a national initiative to improve children's health and education".
A biannual spray, which helps with daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth brushing with Fluoride, is the focus of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing microscopic organisms from the skin increases the effectiveness when soap or baking soda is mixed with water.
The original purpose of soap and soap powder was to reduce the barriers to success and increase digestion.
Water is the only essential ingredient for skin cleansing because it makes proteins, which are naturally found in the soil, insoluble in water.
It is purified with the help of running water.
Water soap because it can be reused at any time, can retain bacteria obtained from previous uses.
A small number of studies have shown that the transfer of bacteria from contaminated soap is not complete as the bacteria travel with the foam.
The CDC states that "water soap and drainage are the best".
The public is advised to use disinfectant soaps.
To date, there is no evidence to support its use in antimicrobial or antimicrobial resistance.
However, antibacterial soaps contain antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which contains a large number of structural components of bacteria.
So even if the antibodies are not selected for the antibacterial soap, they are likely not to be as effective as advertised.
In addition to surfactant and skin protective agent, the cosmetic formula may contain lactic acid as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and skin condition enhancer (aleo vera, vitamin, menthol, plant extract) A summary of research from the University of Oregon School of Public Health states that soap is clearly as effective as triclosan-based disinfectant soaps for protection against illness and to kill hand-borne bacteria.
The hot water that is used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria are most active at temperatures of 37 degrees Celsius.
Even though, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water is more effective at removing oil underneath, and tiny impurities that are invisible to the eye.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research shows that using hot water is not effective in reducing the number of microorganisms in your hands.
A hand sanitizer or anti-bacterial oil that is originally a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based and non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, medicinal hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) became popular.
Most of them rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) in an oil, or a hemectant such as glycerin in water, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding hydrogen-peroxide, to maintain the proper functioning of the hands, hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60-95% are the most effective in killing bacteria.
Hand sanitizer is effective against bacteria, resistant to antibiotics, multi-drug antibiotics (MRSA and VRE) tuberculosis and other viruses (including HIV, zoonotic, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5 reduction, equivalent to 35 decbel reduction) of bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5 reduction) of bacteria on hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers have an antibacterial effect and a branching effect on viruses.
Alcohol hand soap has no effect on norovirus, the most common cause of gastroenteritis (stomach infection).An antiseptic or alcohol should be used to soak or cover both hands.
The front and back of the hands and between the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the water, foam or detergent dries.
The fingers should be washed thoroughly, and the palms of the hands should be cleaned thoroughly.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hand sanitizer, especially if the hands are physically dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on the ease of use and quick disinfection actions against bacteria However they should be used as a substitute for proper washing and in the absence of water or soap.
Excessive use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause dry skin unless emollients and/or anti-drying agents are included in the mixture.
The effect of drying or removal of handwashing agents can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or emollient to the gel.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antibacterial soap.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or allergic reaction to chemicals or exposure to hand washing products does not occur.
The reluctance to draw the risk of contact dermatitis has become a focus on hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not clean hands, but instead contaminate them.
This is why hand sanitizer is less effective than hand washing with soap and water to prevent the spread of many germs, since other infections are found on the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizer depends on its chemical composition and the place where it is applied, and according to history it is less useful than ointments.
Recently, it has been shown that synthetic benzalkonium chloride has a rich and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike benzalkonium chloride, the effectiveness decreases after repeated application, possibly due to the development of severe skin lesions.
Many in poor nations cannot afford soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Soil or dirt may be more useful than a bucket of water, but it is not as effective as soap.
Another concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that are invisible to the naked eye, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a representative of soap because it can release bacteria when mixed with alkaline compounds.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of ash or clay as a substitute for soap if it is not available.
The best hand hygiene practices by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of infection are as follows:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
The use of running water is advised as the water in the valley may become polluted while the temperature of the water will not change.
Rub the hands with soap and spit, including the back of the hands, between the thumbs, and under the armpits.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more often when using soap rather than just water.
The cooking lasts for at least 20 seconds.
The brushing creates a tight hold, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and a long brushing removes many of the bacteria.
It is well-drained in running water.
Hands washing in a dish can restore hands.
A towel and a towel that are air-dried in the bed are dry.
The hands or hands tend to move more easily, the most common areas are the forearm, wrist, between the thumb and forefinger, between the fingers, and the tips of the fingers.
Fingers that have been touched by hand wipes can be contaminated with bacteria.
It is recommended to use a face mask to prevent the hands from drying out, dry skin can cause skin damage which can reduce the risk of infection.
There are many simple methods that can be used to improve hand washing where there is no tap water and/or soap for example, pouring water from a hanging jar or a hollow drain or using a hand sanitizer with holes and/or holes if necessary in developing countries. Where there is no water supply (such as schools or villages in developing countries), there are water conservation methods such as hanging pots and other simple methods.
The handless pedal tap is a simple technique consisting of a bow and a rope, and a footrest to pour a little water on the hands with a soap stick.
Washing hands properly is a method of hand hygiene but there is debate about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
The tests and recommendations of the paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers that are available in most bathrooms.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, conducted by the European Tissue Symposium, compared the cleanliness of hand-dried paper towels, hand-dried paper towels and hand-dried air towels.
After washing and drying hands with a warm-air dryer, it was found that the total number of small and invisible blisters increased in the forehead by at least 194% and the palm by 254%.
Drying with a dehumidifier increased the average number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and in the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total bacterial count on the bottom of the fingers was reduced by 76% and on the palm by 77%.The scientists also conducted some tests to determine whether there could be contamination between the toilet users and the toilet environment due to any type of drying process.
The air-breathing jet engine, which blows air out of the unit at 180m/s (650km/h; 400mph) can wipe small particles from the hand and machine and can damage users and other washing machines and the washing machine environment up to 2 metres high.
Using a dryer and heating air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The analysis showed no presence of a wide range of microorganisms, which are invisible to the naked eye.In 2005, a study by TUV and Nature assessed various hand-drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts after observing dry hands:
Several hand dryer manufacturers existed, and the hand dryer was likened to a paper towel.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer is an alternative when traveling when soap and water are unavailable.
An alcohol-containing hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical hand wash system was forced to be validated by a Hungarian Ignaz semmelwais in 1846 to prevent the spread of disease in hospital premises.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found both reduced infection and benefits.
Medical handwashing lasts at least 15 minutes, using a large amount of soap and water or oil to scrub and rub each area of the hand.
The hands are held together, so that the youngsters can sit together.
If there is debris under the fingers, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can be present in the water left on our hands, it is important to keep it well-drained and to wipe it with a clean, dry towel.
After drying, use paper towels to seal the water (open any outlet if possible).
This also prevents contamination of the hands and these surfaces.
Hand washing in health care systems is aimed at removing pathogenic microorganisms (viruses) and preventing their spread.
A recent medical journal reported that hand washing is not acceptable in many healthcare settings, most doctors and midwives often forget to wash their hands before touching patients, which leads to the spread of germs that spread disease.
Studies have shown that proper hand washing and following other simple procedures can reduce the incidence of catheter-related blood infections by 66%, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a paper that recommends proper hand washing and hand massage in Health.
This hand hygiene guideline can be found on the public opinion website.
Whitby et al. conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure hand sanitization, if a plan is needed, consent is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five moments to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or body fluids.
Before the operation aseptic, and
"after the patient's wash. The addition of disinfectant to the soap ("antibacterial" soap or "antibacterial treatment") increases the disinfecting effect of hand washing oils".
Such disinfection may be required before or after surgery, in highly resistant surgical tissue, hand sanitizer for surgical procedures, a pump that can be turned on and off without manual touch, some chlorhexidine or detergent, sterile towels for drying hands after washing, and sterile brushes for cleaning and other sterile equipment for cleaning under fingers.
All the ornaments were removed.
This procedure requires washing hands for at least 2 to 6 minutes.
Longer sessions (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When washing hands, do not allow water to be left behind in the hands.
After washing, the hands were dried with a lensless cloth and the washing cloths were then rubbed.
To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is advisable to wash hands or use a protective soap before and after visiting the patient.
For the treatment of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the maximum benefit of hand washing was up to 20% and the minimum benefit obtained by washing hands daily was increased to over 35%.
Regular hand-washing with soap leads to more than three times the risk of bacterial contamination to food compared to washing with a disinfectant soap. Comparing hand-washing with a disinfectant with hand-washing with a disinfectant for 30 minutes each showed that alcohol-based hand washing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than disinfectant soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand washing agents for reducing H1N1 infection and diarrhoea and clostridium deficient spores from hands.Actions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings can promote education for workers on hand washing, and the availability of hand washing agents for brushes and handwriting and reminders for employees.
There is a need for more research, to identify which are the most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is seen as a simple, healthy way to stay healthy, and even to eat better.
Although the lack of safe drinking water, soap and hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve global hand-washing standards.
For example in most rural areas of Africa hand washing pumps near public toilets are scarce, although there are cheaper options for building hand wash stations.
Although the lack of a washing area may be the result of a culture rather than lack of soap and water.
Giving advice on handwashing with soap can influence decision making, increase awareness of the importance of handwashing and can lead to changes in behaviour.
For this to work properly, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A review of 70 studies showed that community-based handwashing awareness was most effective in increasing confidence in handwashing in LMICs, while public marketing campaigns were less effective.An example for school-based handwashing awareness is the Three Star Approach developed by UNICEF that encourages schools to take non-commercial measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, along with other hygiene measures.
If the goal is achieved, the school can be promoted to the final star category.
Hand washing facilities can be a means of campaigning and publicising efforts to reduce childhood illness and death.
International Handwashing Day is an example of awareness raising that is trying to change attitudes.In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the impact of handwashing costs in developing countries, in relation to DALY prohibition.
However, it is recommended that improved hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing for human health especially for people in extreme situations such as mothers giving birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals dates back to the mid-19th Century through the pioneers of two hand hygiene practices. Hugary Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the pioneer of modern nursing.
At that time, many people believed that the disease was spread by a parasite called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne illness outbreaks and the risk of infection due to poor health care led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend hand hygiene as a critical way to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
The 2009 whooping cough epidemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such diseases.
For example, a sign with an "approved hand washing toilet" is displayed near hand washing facilities in public servants' offices and in the offices of the state administration and airports in Germany.
"The expression 'washing the hands of another' means, perhaps, that the unbeliever is not to be blamed for the wrong or to share in the suffering".
It is based on the biblical text in matthew, where pontius pilates washed his hands for the crucifixion of jesus christ, but they have become a phrase with a wide usage in english literature.
In Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins by washing her hands and thinking of clearing her mind of the stain, which shows her guilty conscience for her crime and makes her husband do the same.
It was also found that some people wash their hands more often than others after thinking about doing something illegal, and they often use hand sanitizer more than others.
In addition, those permitted to wash their hands after such acts were not to be expected to perform some sort of vengeful cleansing, such as sacrifices.
Religious washing of hands for hygiene and ritual purposes is a part of ritual hand washing in many religions, including the Bahai Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavado in Christianity, and wundu in Islam. Religions also encourage hand washing, especially after certain rites.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam all agree on the importance of hand washing and toilet use.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam all have a mandate to wash their hands before or after every meal.
Managing workplace risk for COVID-19
Workplace risk monitoring from COVID-19 provides workplace safety and health measures to monitor risks to protect people from being infected with the 2019 COVID-19 coronavirus.
The appropriate workplace risk assessment is based on the workplace and work environment, based on the analysis of the risk associated with the site of transmission, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk associated with workers who may be infected with COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the risk of exposure to workplace exposure from contact with the public and other co-workers is recommended by the prevention of infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are unwell, breathing control, routine cleaning, and disinfection of workplace environments.
Occupations at risk include those that require close contact or contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission occurring within the community or traveling abroad.
This includes workers who have contact with the public such as schools, crowded environments, and places where there is a high level of shopping.
Risk management for these groups, in addition to prevention measures include, ventilation equipment that uses microfilters, masks and accessories in case of a COVID-19 infection.
OSHA considers healthcare and household workers exposed to a known or suspected individual with COVID-19 to be at increased risk, which increases to a higher risk of exposure if workers follow aerosol spray protocols, or collect or handle samples from, a known or suspected individual with COVID-19.
Hazardous materials suitable for the workplace include engineering materials such as air-pressurized room, and employee protection equipment suitable for the job.
COVID-19 exposure can have many effects on the workplace.
Employees may absent themselves from work because of illness, to care for others, or to fear contagion.
Business models can change, both in terms of the type of goods required, and how the goods are produced (such as through overnight shopping or through drive-through services).
Finally, shipments to continental areas with high COVID-19 infection rates may be disrupted. Preparation for a contagious disease can be used as a response mechanism in the management of the pandemic.
Good safety practices reduce the risks associated with workplaces and occupations, including the incidence of disease, risks arising from domestic and community conditions, and workplace risks such as age or other serious health conditions.
They outlined the appropriate precautions for the risks, and the measures for such a potential outbreak.
Communicable disease programmes and response plans may be the subject of national or sub-national consultations.
The goals of information sharing when an outbreak is detected include reducing its spread among employees, protecting the health of those most vulnerable to infection, reforming business processes and reducing the interference of others who are on the system.
CUtar has an impact on the neighborhoods where the business is conducted.
Risk tracking is a process used to determine whether the occupational health and safety risk category is of relevance.
Where the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the best precautions are engineering precautions, followed by management precautions, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering waste relates to the removal of workers from work-related hazards without relying on worker behaviour, and would be a cheap solution that is implemented.
The agency is looking into changing working conditions and procedures that would require an employee's consent.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered to be a non-invasive measure to help prevent infection, but it can reduce the risk of infection.
All PPE must be selected before the hazard occurs to the worker, properly fitted (e.g. respirator), installed when and where appropriate, and inspected regularly, replaced if caught and removed, washed, and properly fitted to prevent injury.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a low risk of workplace injury is the employee's limited interaction with the public and other employees.
The basic prevention and control recommendations for all workplaces include daily thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are unwell, ventilation with roof and ventilation, provision of paper and waste storage, planning to work from home or to turn the trash if necessary, preventing workers from using tools and other equipment, and maintaining a clean environment to reduce contamination and pollution.
Early detection and isolation of the affected population is the most effective way to protect the health and safety of employees, customers, guests and the public at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with respiratory symptoms stay home until they are cured, if the symptoms last for more than 24 hours and the battery is not rested or the symptoms are not treated and sick leave is appropriate, the employee should stay home and treat the patient as they know the schedule.
According to OSHA, the occupations at risk of infection include those requiring contact within six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected COVID-19 individuals, but who may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community-acquired transmission in commercial settings, or because someone has traveled abroad to a location where COVID-19 transmission has occurred.
These include employees who have contact with the general public such as in schools, workplaces with highly congested work environments, and areas where there is a high volume of shopping. Engineering management for this and the hazardous waste group includes the installation of improved air barrier systems, increased amounts of ventilation, the installation of physical barriers such as plastic protective equipment, and the installation of drive-through windows for customer service management. The scope of this includes the most hazardous waste group which includes unhealthy employees who are confined to their homes, changing face-to-face and mobile communication capabilities, the introduction of mobile devices and the use of hazard-free assembly lines where COVID-19 has spread, the development of emergency communication systems for workers concerned, the improvement of personal and face-to-face COVID-19 safety equipment, the provision of personal protective equipment, the need for training of employees, and the need to provide other safety, hygiene, safety, and security measures that can be required to respond to COVID-19, and the need to provide safe, clean and efficient workplace environments for workers, and other workers, and the need to provide appropriate training and prevention measures for COVID-19 workers, and other hazardous workers.
A crew member on a storm squadron needs to use air compressors.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, the appropriate controls to protect the crew and other passengers include separating the patient by a distance of 6 feet, designating one of the flight crew to serve the patient, and providing a mask to the patient or asking the patient to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue while coughing or sneezing.
Sailors should wear medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or a potential body fluid or environmental contamination, and possibly additional protective equipment if a sick passenger has a fever, a cough, or respiratory distress.
Hand sanitizers and other items that may be disposed of in a hazard bag, the surface of the infected area should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transportation, including leisure flights and other passenger flights, risk management includes delaying travel during illness, self-awareness and informing the health care facility immediately if a person develops fever or other symptoms during travel.
The best practices and health systems in quarantined areas are: In schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends that they be temporarily closed to maintain a clean environment even if a person is found to have the bacterial infection and its spread in the neighborhood.
If there is a low incidence of infection in the community, it is recommended to adopt social distancing measures such as restricting traffic, meetings, even large gatherings such as a choir or choir class, or dining hall, move tables, and departure times, reduce unnecessary visitors, and isolate a section of the community that has flu symptoms.
When there is a widespread transmission of the disease in the home community, in addition to social distancing, long school holidays may be considered.For family workers who are on their normal day-to-day work, the risk of infection is low, the CDC said.
Officials who must contact people who have been diagnosed with or suspected to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the emergency protocols of the healthcare professionals, along with appropriate protective equipment.
If contact is found during a panic, the employee should clean and sanitize his/her equipment before reuse using a household sprayer or cleaner, and follow the instructions for use to reach and dispose of used PPE and wash his/her equipment.
OSHA checked the possibility of a medical facility and staff at the morgue to remain standing for the risk of infection.
The risk of cases with human symptoms has been associated with healthcare workers, support, laboratory and ambulance staff exposed to the patient or suspected COVID-19.
They are at greater risk if the workers follow the aerosol-generating protocol, or test a substance from a suspected co-infected person for COVID-19.
Aerosal generating pocedures include injections, coughing, and aerosol injections involving the lungs and others.
The most at-risk are those who work in mortuaries, including workers who tend to the bodies of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these are particularly at risk if they test for the virus. Additional engineering controls in these high-risk groups include isolation rooms for those infected or suspected to have COVID-19 during aerosol-generating procedures.
Special ventilation systems may be appropriate in some areas of the shelter such as warehouses.
All samples should be handled with three levels of Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the isolation of new patients in other settings may be related to the presence of COVID-19 infection.In addition to certain PPE, OSHA recommends the use of ventilation equipment for those working within 6 feet of patients with known or suspected SARS-COV-2 infection, and those undergoing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH has approved N95 for respiratory filtration or even for safe use, a safety standard that includes rigorous testing, education and clinical trials.
Some ventilators can provide better protection and improve worker well-being.WHO does not recommend the use of a respirator, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is spread through body fluids.
WHO has recommended that medical masks are appropriate for point-of-entry screening staff.
For those who undergo respiratory testing from, observe, or handle a person infected with COVID-19 without an aerosol-generating procedure, WHO recommends that surgical masks, goggles, or face shields, a headgear, and gloves.
If the aerosol-generating spray is followed, it will replace the use of a medical face mask N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE by providing contactless medication, physical barriers such as a face mask, allowing those involved in the care to directly enter a room with an infected person with COVID-19, using PPE only for specific work, continuing to use a standard ventilator without removing it when treating multiple patients with the same illness, and standardizing the supply of PPE, and restricting the use of face masks for people with symptoms.

[COVID-19] Disposal and preparation for the future
The following is a list of notable people who were born in, residents of, or are otherwise closely associated with the city of San Francisco, California.
Authorized by: CC0: No rights reserved
That month was a special one for us.
The COVID-19 pandemic is another manifestation of our relationship to the world and the burden that it places on each of us.
We do not prefer challenges, but we do hate that our response is based on the empathy, collaboration and community building that resides in the heart of the organisation.
The mutual care we have seen in all our colleagues over emails, calls, and chats is another proof of the trustworthy people we are fortunate to work with.
I will not fail to be a part of my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared his appreciation for our work
They reminded me how the world could change Wikipedia from what it is, which is a champion of open access to the web and open to everyone.
Your actions make this possible, whether you keep the sites down or our partners pay for them or from our community's archives.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
It is a time when not what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the use of this and your role we are making some changes to our work schedule which will start next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn said, their c-team met last night to discuss our closeness and plans for the coming days and months.
In this regard, we have considered what we think would be the right answer to what we are facing and the best way that would keep the organization fit for that time.
We want to relieve stress and support our long-term goals.
If you want to call more, call.
For all employees, contractors and our employees
Our work week will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We don't give a break - if you can work well within the normal hours, the organisation can work with you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and should you be watching your diet, buying a spice, or going to a doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't follow your timetable
If you are sick, do not work
That went unmentioned, but we're talking about it.
No sick days or need for the PTO to tell your manager with the help of your organization's calendar and priority confirmation system.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, Bryan's grave in T&amp;C Ops will be aware of this and T&amp;C will help ensure that the case receives appropriate treatment.)
The full compensation will be paid to the People of the Hour.
We have said, and we honor all our commitments to deliver our contracts with our co-workers.
Each was paid according to the nature of the work done and the hours worked.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you are going to work, we will support you.
Many people seek employment as a way to deal with the world around them.
What we do can be very rewarding, especially at such times.
This is also true for self-care.
Our job is to talk to your manager, then we'll know what we need and how we can adjust.
Some tasks are more important.
There are some things that we should continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Loyalty, and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing a critical job that requires additional support.
We will start to implement all the elements to assess the current policy and shift the focus to supporting what is important in our work.
There is still much work for us to do, but we will focus on the important things.
A little bit of fat today won't hurt you in the future.
Do not plan to travel twice to achieve your goals once the pandemic is over.
You would not want to work overtime just because it is not possible to complete the work now.
We have accepted the changing circumstances, and we will do the work that will provide new arrangements in due course.
What happened to the APP (Annual Program)?
To be able to switch to the current situation and beyond our routine, we are thinking of changing the timing to be able to reach our 2020-2021 annual plan
Our intention is to extend our 2019-2020 budget that will allow more budget time to allow employees to focus on their core tasks, self-care, and loved ones care while leaving those who need or want to work on reduced schedules in the weeks to come.
The additional time further reduces the workload and pressure across the organization.
We will be sending our plan to our meeting next week with new officers and staff on our next plan for confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, safety, and cleanliness
Last week we learned that one of the SF-BASED staff members had tested positive for COVID-19.
However, in a precautionary move, we hired a team of sanitation technicians to clean the entire hallway at our San Francisco office.
Clean or disinfect the area to prevent the spread of infection, including the roads and the underground partition.
The city is developing a new system of health care and monitoring to ensure the health of its citizens.
We are thrilled that the branch will be cleaned whenever we plan to return.
Our DC-based office at WeWork, which has been providing COVID-19 services to any DC-BASED employee
Last week, our DC office became a full-fledged facility with security information from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues who live in NYC know, we are in talks about offering a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but are often delayed.
Some of our employees are working remotely for the first time.
Our remote colleagues know that it can be a bit of a compromise, and they are willing to offer advice.
Reduce the length of the conversation to one or two hours in a row.
If a longer period is required, think about how they will be distributed over the next several days.
Be sure of the meeting, state the purpose of the meeting, and send reading materials.
Make video a real-time experience, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate face-to-face online meetings and communication.
Take the lead for the facilitation of each meeting, one to supervise discussions for questions and follow-up of the speaker list, and one to help with the recording of notes (or co-authoring of notes).
Email tech support if you need a headset that is too expensive.
Use your health supplement as a snack.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about work sharing.
HR functions are looking for leadership in the management of the foundation building ergonomics to support the effective distribution of work across the Foundation.
We asked all of our allies last week to drop Wikimedia funding to the public, like editathons, until the WHO says the pandemic is over.
We made it clear that we understood our need to lift some restrictions that would make the completion of their funding agreements difficult and that no one would be penalised for delays or policy changes.
We will be following more guidelines over the next week on Wikimedia and other community sites and events as usual.
The idea of a global community has been described as both sad and disruptive but has been re-evaluated with a strong focus on communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
In the future, CRT is working on creating a META-WIKI page to provide a platform for the public to monitor and track all our data.
Stay informed about COVID-19
We will send you a calendar invitation next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special meeting for our staff.
We will use this time to share more updates, answer questions and spend a little time getting to know each other.
We are in this together and are here to help in any way we can.
For now, you can find my details in this email, and related COVID-19 information on Office Wiki,
CRT on the back pages is fine with all the data in one place.
We are working to keep in touch with the staff who are living in the countries currently affected.
If you have a question about travel, a business, a job, a vacancy or anything else then you need help don't hesitate to let CRT support know.
We are there to provide our help and support when needed.
If you have an urgent matter or issue that needs attention, please send an email to Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
Such changes should not be viewed as a complete and unconditional withdrawal.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our work schedule may need to be adjusted in a way that we have not done before.
These are the steps we see as essential to supporting each other and to keep us running, providing our organisation with the support they need, and the work the world depends on.
Our work schedule is there and waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to care for one another and to make room for the important work that lies ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need your help in making this possible, so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that we can be of assistance if such a need arises.
Now, please - wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, she CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), along with the other directors (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestine.
ACE2 modulates the activity of the conjugate-associated enzyme (ACE) by reducing the concentration of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry route for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is called hACE2.
The active enzyme of Angiotensin 2 is a zinc-containing ironloenzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The protein of ACE2 is composed of an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transport domain.
ACE2 is a type of transmembrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain that exposes the cell surface in the lung and other tissues.
The extracellular region of ACE2 is cleaved from the infected region by an enzyme known as hematopoiesis, and the resulting soluble protein is excreted into the bloodstream and ultimately in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 binds to most type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, vascular and cardiac stem cells and soft tissue cells in most organs.
ACE2 MRNA receptors can be found in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus strain and briainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to stand as a balancing factor for ACE.
ACE is inhibited by the vasoconstricting angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II.
ACE2 is in turn bound to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine by angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can clear certain peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the amino acid intermediate SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup syndrome.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry route into the cell for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Similarly, the combination of the protein spike s1 of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 binds to the receptor ACE2 in the cell nucleus, which in turn causes endocytosis and translocation of the pathogenic agent into the endosome, which is the cell's interior.
The interaction of tar-like S protein priming principles with the serine protease TMPRSS2 gene, the formation of which is currently being investigated as a major therapeutic. This leads to a decrease in the level of ACE2 in the cells, which may help fight the disease.
Although it is common, many patients require further regulation of the ACE inhibitor regimen with ARB therapy.
A review published on July 11, 2012 found that ACE inhibitors were associated with a 34% reduction in cold compared to placebo.
The risk of catching a cold or being given ACE inhibitors is very high, with the risk of infection, death or cardiac arrest.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduced rate of pulmonary mortality, although the effect was not significant beyond the risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a potential treatment for acute pneumonia, manifested by improvement in lung function and insufficient airflow in the small intestine and induction of lipopolysaccharide pathways that cause symptoms of respiratory distress.
The RHACE2 half-life in humans is 10 hours and 30 seconds of action including an additional 24 hours of action.
Several studies have suggested that rhACE2 may be effective in treating patients who are intolerant to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with elevated anglotensin II circuitry. rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of symptoms of acute respiratory distress.
"b'COVID-19 are mobile software applications designed to assist contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (""contacts"") who may have been in contact with an infected person".
access to opportunities is restricted or limited, but government support is limited in some areas with a high population density.
Several methods to identify the connected are being developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly about the system related to tracking of user locations in countries with apps.
A small air vent to enter a camp with a wire fence.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would be merging functions to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the country's government, in collaboration with Alipay, deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19 infection.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The app was developed by the local IT community, released as a beta and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched ""StopKorona!"", a Bluetooth-based app to detect threats from people infected with the virus and provide feedback to health authorities".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced the official version of the app, which was released in the same month as the app called Stopcovid in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a large-scale version of the tool for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists some potential problems with implementing web application plans, including false flags and potential inefficiencies if the adoption of the tool is limited to a small community.
Addressing concerns about the possible fraudulent spread or infection of the coronavirus app, Apple has set a limit on the number of apps that an organization can put on the app store that have a coronavirus link, limiting them to societies or other well-known organizations.
Google and amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the impact of community-based surveillance using coronavirus tools, particularly about whether surveillance tools developed to address the Coronavirus pandemic will be discarded once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for an end to this form of surveillance.
The groups have identified eight categories of government services:
Surveillance activities must be legal, then necessary, and then appropriate.
or care for the animal may have a delay.
the use of data must be brief for COVID-19 purposes;
Confidential information and communications must be protected and displayed to be protected on reasonable grounds;
Monitoring patients through digital devices must avoid bias and isolation.
any exchange of information with others must be legally defined;
There is protection against abuse and a civil duty to respond to abuse;
Access to the interview is required for all candidates, several health workers and the German CCC and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) journalists have also been shortlisted.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the issue of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking from the operating system of their devices as long as it is no longer needed.
some countries have used location tracking instead of the app which highlights the benefits of downloading the app and protecting the location tracking.
In Israel, censorship of communications was tolerated.
Networks that have access to geographic resource information have a high priority to highlight privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to a central database; many privacy-oriented systems have been created that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea a non-manual method of identifying the cause is used.
Rather than using a standard app, the system collects tracking data from multiple sources including phone and card transaction data, and combines these to trigger notifications via text messages to infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert contacts, the government also made the location information public, something that was allowed due to the many changes to privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is made publicly available through certain applications and websites. Accounts that include Germany are encrypted using a confidentiality and privacy policy.
As of 6 April 2020, no information has been released about the incident.
Privacy-based contact tracing is a well-established process, with a well-established body of casework dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen experts are working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to pin proximity to the user and other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a collaborative effort that encompasses both intermediate and flexible protocols, not a single protocol. The standards offered include the Identity Privacy Framework (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Area Codes (TCN, fka interconnect numbering services, CEN), Privacy Framework and Protocols for the Investigation of Wireless Communications (PACT) among others.
In this data security system, the device is not allowed to access all the data on the device.
The MIT Access Control Laboratory is developing a secure protocol that is based on the concept of non-access tracking and the use of an isolated data source to track the spread of COVID-19.

They also published the scientific code used in the expedition.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to roll out in three stages:
It is a tool to enable the government to create a platform for the followers and prevent the entry of people.
integrating these operating systems directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple programs to address maintenance issues and progress by distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in the process once the threat has passed.

Many of the courses have been designed to provide a level I education on safety issues such as;
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I enhanced by the antibiotics: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Series I of the vaccine and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
A report by the experts in April, 115 drugs were initially developed and 78 were confirmed in development 79 according to 37 medical schools wanting to make public their lack of information are thought to be planned or planned in several laboratories.
In Phase I-II of the initial safety test and shield test, the combination is non-selective and non-inertial and in many cases, it allows for a more accurate assessment.
Phase III trials typically involve additional participants, including a control group, and a test of the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring for the effects of the worst-case outcome.

That means they can get benefits beyond the disease that is prevented.
A development of a pilot project in Australia requires the recruitment of 4,170 health workers
It is possible that the vaccine in progress will not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to determine the efficacy of a vaccine using the COVID-19 specificity of animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, and other laboratory animals of non-human origin, have highlighted the need for a three-stage biosafety-level 3 regulation of live virus retention, and global standardization to ensure a safe system.
Antibodies against SARS and MERS have been developed in human animal models.
As of 2020, no cure or vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.There is also no effective vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there are two MERS vaccines (based on DNA) that have completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in development, all of which are viral-mediated vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and a vaccine has already been developed.
References published through various social media outlets cite existing information about the molecular sequencing and vaccination of certain coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the highly contagious and highly infectious coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach cramps.
The period from infection to the appearance of symptoms is about five days but can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and multiple bacterial defects.
As of 17 April 2020, more than two million (2.24) new cases have been reported from 210 countries, resulting in more than 153 million deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The disease is spread by close contact, usually by small droplets of dust from coughs, sneezing, or speech.
As the spores come out during respiration, most of them fall to the ground or surface rather than being contagious from a distance.
People can become infected by touching contaminated faeces and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most commonly spread during the first three days after symptoms first appear, although it can be spread before symptoms appear later.The primary diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab.
It is recommended to use face masks for those who suspect they have the infection, along with their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of face masks by the public vary, with some authorities recommending avoiding their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific vaccine against COVID-19.
Domestic measles deaths have been recorded in most countries across the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may become symptomatic or develop symptoms of influenza infection such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and tingling of the face or tongue; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are observed.
Occasionally, respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, runny nose or dry throat appear.
Bacterial infections such as heartburn, vomiting and diarrhea are seen in separate episodes.
Some cases of hypertension and heart palpitations have been found in China.
In some, the disease can progress to limonia, limb failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is five to six days but can last from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.Rohoto suggests that not all infected people show symptoms of infection.
The role of these carriers of the disease that does not show up in the transmission is not yet known; although, some witnesses have given indications that they may spread the disease.
The exact proportion of people who are asymptomatic is currently unknown, but is under investigation.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all reported cases are asymptomatic during their stay in hospital.
China's health authorities began to include symptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 new cases on that day, 130 (78%) were symptomatic at the time of testing.
Today's soap can carry a wide range of bacteria.
Speaking with authority allows for a lot more than just speaking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that a person who coughs may be able to attract a fall of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus does not travel through the air, the National Academy of Science suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur if air collectors are placed on the surface outside, near the human environment where the RNA sample was collected.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can produce air contamination that can lead to respiratory infections.
While there is concern that it can be spread through the urethra, this risk is believed to be minimal. The virus is most contagious while people are infected, while transmission is possible before symptoms appear, the risk is minimal.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) says that while the exact spread of the disease is not fully understood, one person can infect two to three others.The virus can survive for hours to days on a surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected for up to one day in cartons, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the temperature and humidity.
Soap is helpful if used correctly; the soap product is antibacterial and removes the infection from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, have no effect.In the Hong Kong study, an oral sample was taken for two days after the initial clinical treatment.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest incidence of disease, followed by the sixth patient showing the highest incidence of disease on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, three cases of pneumonia associated with gang-related illness and respiratory illness were initially isolated in Wuhan.
All novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in the corona virus in the environment.
Outside the human body the virus is killed by a household soap that breaks down its resistance. SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are most susceptible to COVID-19 due to the cell's ability to enter the cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway, which is most prevalent in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a peplomer to bind to ACE2 to enter the host cell.
Cardiac arrest was detected in 12% of hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and is most common in patients with severe disease.
The incidence of heart attacks is especially high, due to inflammatory and immune system problems as the disease progresses, but the prevalence of heart attacks is associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and speed up the cardiac rhythm.
A significant risk of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with a serious progression.All deaths from COVID-19 were associated with damage-associated death (DAD), and inflammatory lymphocyte-mediated infiltration into the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is mutagenic to ACE2-expressing cells of the respiratory tract, patients with COVID-19 have been found to have symptoms of severe inflammation.
In simple terms, it has been shown that the GM-CSF-secreting T-cells are associated with inflammation of IL-6-secreting monocytes and the development of pneumonia in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic was detected and analyzed in the blood.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The test method is direct-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is performed on a breathing sample obtained from a nasopharyngeal test, however, samples taken from the nose and mouth can be used.
The test results are available within two hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks earlier and the results are not immediately valid.
Chinese scientists have isolated a new coronavirus strain and a new genetic sequence and laboratories around the world can develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, tests for antiviral vaccines (which can detect active infection and whether a person has been previously infected) are underway, but are still not widely used.
Based on Chinese diagnostic tests, the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The US FDA approved the first case on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.The diagnostic guide from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University provides recommendations for diagnostic procedures based on clinical features and risk of the virus.
Multilubar connections, opacitis surface glasses with a zone asymmetry and frontal distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural invasion, fractures, and consolidation may appear as the tumor grows.
There is very little information on COVID-19.
The main findings from the excavation are:
Macroscopy: plerisy, pericarditis, pulmonary failure and pulmonary oedema are also seen.
Four severity pneumonia symptoms can be noted:
non-aggressive pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial and lymphocytic swelling and the occurrence of multinucleated giant cells.
pneumonia: Damage to the deep alveolar (DAD) and the deep alveolar exudate.
DAD is a common cause of symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Cures pneumonia: clusters of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic response
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene and avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a piece of toilet paper when coughing or sneezing and recommends using a sleeve if toilet paper is not available.
Hand washing after every cough or sneeze is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public settings, in part to limit transmission of the virus from a symptomatic individual.The social distancing protocol aims to reduce contact with an infected person and large groups of people by closing schools and workplaces and restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing rules require people to give a measurement of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) to the side.
"There is no known effective treatment to prevent COVID-19. Like vaccines, it is not expected to be available until early 2021, and a key component of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the peak of the curve, known as ""flattening the curve""".
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been exposed to smoke or dirty hands, before eating or after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of hand sanitizers containing 60% disinfectant, but only when there is no soap and water available, and in areas that are not well served by hand sanitizers.The WHO has developed two protocols for providing indoor sanitizers.
In these processes, the micro-antimicrobial activity is mediated by the alcohol, ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial pores in beer; it is not effective for hand sanitizing.
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are being treated with supportive care, which may include fluids, respirators and support of other affected organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of being carriers of the virus wear face masks.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to help cardiac arrest due to respiratory failure, but its efficacy has not been proven.
Personal hygiene and good hygiene and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
The supporting evidence is useful in those with mild treatment in the early stages of infection WHO and the Chinese National Health Agency published recommendations on hospital management of patients with COVID-19 infection.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have developed treatment regimens from various agencies, the IBCC.
As of April 2020 there is no specific vaccine for the COVID-19 virus.
For the sake of clarity, some medical experts have recommended that paracetamol be substituted for ibuprofen.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the spread of the virus, especially in healthcare settings where workplaces that can generate aerosols such as hand ventilators are considered.
Healthcare providers treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in AIIR, an isolated room with precautions, contact precautions and ventilation precautions.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the outbreak.
Recommended personal protective equipment is: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and gloves. Where available, respirator (rather than face shield) are preferred.
N95 respirators are allowed for industrial settings but the FDA has allowed face mask protection under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against contaminants such as dust but are effective against a specific biological agent that is not susceptible to being used without a medical prescription.
When there are no restrictions, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or similar masks that are made at home.
The COVID-19 strain is not severe enough to require ventilation or alternatively, it is sometimes available.
Respiratory support formulation for people with COVID-19 disease is being studied for people with respiratory distress in hospitals, with some evidence suggesting that intravascular administration with nasal congestion or respiratory distress may be prevented.
It is not known whether either of these two could provide the same benefits to people suffering from chronic illness.
Some physicians prefer invasive ventilation systems because the system's suspension slows the transmission of aerosols, compared to the passage of a nasal cannula. The severity of the disease is more common in the elderly (over 60 years of age, up to 80 years of age).
Many developing countries lack sufficient hospital beds or any resources, which reduces the capacity of health systems to handle the rising number of cases of COVID-19 that are so severe that they require a hospital bed.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are admitted to the ICU.
Respiratory ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure-regulated ventilation and PEEP are required to increase ventilation, while reducing the risk of respiratory-related pneumothorax.
A long PEEP cannot be obtained in an old air conditioning unit.
Research into treatments began in January 2020, and clinical trials of drugs against a number of diseases are underway.
Remdesivir appeared to be the most complete.
Although new drugs may take time until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are being tested at a later stage.
Antibiotic therapy may be tried in patients with severe disease.
advised WHO volunteers to engage in procedures to ensure the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted provisional approval for convalescent plasma as a single life-threatening human trial.
The necessary clinical studies to prove its efficacy and significance for the disease have not yet been conducted.
In February 2020 China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are required to enter a name and an ID number.
The app is able to identify people in close proximity and use surveillance data, thus risking the possibility of infection.
Each user can view the roles of three users.
If potential risks are detected, not isolated by the app alone, it can alert local health officials.Analysis of big data on phone data, facial recognition technology, phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to detect people who are infected, and people who have come into contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020 the Israeli government allowed security authorities to track the mobile phone data of people infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine to contain those who have been in contact with an infected person.
And in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone locations and data with the German federal government's agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to explore ways of combating the spread of the disease.
Russia deployed identity and facial recognition technology to identify quarantine rule-breakers.
Italy's health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that mobile phone operators had informed him that 40% of people were continuing to use them.
The German government held a 48-week holiday programme with over 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid also called for a global response to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may be troubled by quarantines, travel restrictions, medical conditions, or fear of contracting the disease.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increasing social isolation, isolation, mental health concerns, exhaustion and economic collapse are a perfect storm that will harm people's mental health and public health""".
This disease can be easily transmitted with few or no symptoms, similar to lymphatic fever, which is a common cold.
Symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, while the symptoms may take three to six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk for infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are limited. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In those most affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure.
The associated complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, unusual blood clots and damage to the heart, kidney and liver.
High blood pressure, especially increased freezing period. It was reported that in six percent (6%) of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, the kidney pressure was high and four percent (4%) were in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated levels of liver enzymes (Transaminases).
According to one report, the time between the first symptoms and death was ten days, with a five-day hospital stay.
However, patients who are referred to the ICU have a seven-day window between being admitted to hospital and dying.
In earlier case studies, the average time from the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of mouse lung samples showed damage to the alveola and fibromyxoid cells that originate from both lungs.
Viruses have also been observed to mutate in the pneumocyte.
The picture is similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the national health agency, cardiac damage was observed either by increased troponin levels or by heart attack.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients have this condition. The availability of medical resources and regional economies can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from this condition vary due to differences between regions and management challenges.
Failing to count new cases of minor infections may result in a higher death toll and may be exaggerated.
Yet, the fact that death is the result of past illness may indicate that the particular threat of death is being ignored.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to get severe COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers, with concerns raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
Officials at Hong Kong Hospital found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung examinations showed a decrease in the body mass of people.
This can cause a problem after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not yet known whether those infected have recovered, or whether they have long-term immunity to the virus.
A positive test for coronavirus was found, based on the characteristics of some coronaviruses, but there was a case of positive test for coronavirus in those recovered from COVID-19 who were re-tested in the next period reported.
These concerns are thought to have increased the spread of infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be genetic and has an animal origin, through infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of the virus has almost taken over human-to-human transmission.
A review of 41 COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, showed that the first day of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The World Health Organization announced that the first symptoms of the disease appeared on December 8, 2019.
Many of the steps are taken to ease the burden of death
These numbers vary by region and are influenced by the extent of testing over time, the quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, the time since the outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 code U07.1 for laboratory-related deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinical deaths or epidemiologically confirmed COVID-19 cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the CFR (Consultative Fertility Ratio) which shows the number of people, both screened and untested, who have died from the disease.
These estimates are provisional and follow a specific population from infection through cure.
Although not all people have immune systems that fight infections, the presence of chemicals can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Genglet, the disease is spread during the Carnival festival, and transmission to adolescents is the most common cause of death and not all treatments for COVID-19 are designed in a similar way.
After that the German health system was not overcome.
In the Netherlands, about three percent (3%) have a chemically-based infection, which is determined by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The disease and mortality rates differ between men and women.
In a survey in China and Italy, the death rate is higher among men
The highest risk for infection in men is those aged 50 and over, with a gender difference of only about 90%.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reason for the gender gap is not known, but drugs and sexual activity may be a factor.
The differences in immune systems between men and women, the lower rate of smoking in women and the earlier onset of high blood pressure in men than in women increased the mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of infections were male, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government has not differentiated between men and women for COVID-19 infection.
Studies show that infections from viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women at different times.
The majority of health workers, i.e. surgeons, are women, and they have a high risk of contracting the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the name of the disease will be officially ""COVID-19""".
WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the disease was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid the stereotype of a localised (e.g. China), animal or human species, similar to the system of naming that seeks to avoid discrimination.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization uses the COVID-19 virus and the virus that causes COVID-19 in public communication.
All infections and viruses are referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV, a common respiratory infection as the provisional names for the virus and the infection according to the 2015 guidelines on the use of sites in infectious and viral species.
The names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were assigned on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in the available format, some digital manufacturers are printing Healthcare products such as nasal swabs and ventilation units.
For example, when a hospital in Italy had an emergency ventilation failure and the attendant was not available at the time of the emergency, the local rotary engine was able to produce the required 100 valves overnight.
After the emergence of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, fake news emerged on the origin, scale, prevention and other aspects of the virus that spread rapidly online.
Humans can transmit disease to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine for the disease.
International research on COVID-19 is being conducted by governmental organizations, academic organizations and industry research groups.
In March, the World Health Organization began a trial, SOLIDARITY Trial to test four new antibiotics that are expected to be effective.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are working on it.
Background work is being done on SARS-CoV because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 to enter the human body.
There are three basic ways to find a location.
Initially, researchers hoped to develop an anti-virus vaccine.
Using such a virus, whether harmless or dead, seeks to create an emergency immunization against a new infection with COVID-19.
The second stage, immunization, is the development of vaccines that help to fight certain types of the disease.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focus on the S-Spike protein which helps the virus to penetrate the enzyme ACE2 enzyme.
The third method is nucleic acid antibiotics (DNA or RNA antibiotics, newly developed forms of antibiotics).
Vaccines from each must be tested for safety and efficacy by 16 March 2020, the first vaccine company trial with four donors in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a neutral genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Anticonvulsants have been suggested as a possible means of producing a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but there is controversy.
There are more than 300 cases undergoing clinical trials as of April 2020.
Seven clinical trials are already being evaluated for the safety of fever treatment, including four studies on hydrochloricquine and chloroquine.
The Chinese trial comprised a combination of vaccines, and there were nine stages of trials on remdesivir in several countries due to the outbreak in late April.
A comprehensive review of clinical development for COVID-19 antiviral and experimental therapies is available. as of April 2020.Most antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, looinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritomavir plus interferon beta.
There is evidence of efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Improvement has been seen in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine is used there for the treatment of malaria, the study was conducted in China in 2020 and the first week of use.
Nevertheless, there are calls for verification of this research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan University of Epidemiology recommends the daily consumption of one gram, as the use of two is highly dangerous and may cause side effects.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency ruling to allow the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of people with COVID-19.The 7th edition Chinese guidelines include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Previous research has suggested that high-dose ribavirin therapy has significant in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.
The use of Nitazoxanide was recommended for further research after showing a weak antibody to SARS-CoV-2.The study showed that early spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 by binding to the ACE2 receptor.
The discovery of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination with koba and azithromycin has a significant limitation that prevents the medical community from entering into the acceptance of alternative therapies without further investigation.Oseltamivir is not a candidate in the SARS-CoV-2 test bottle and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine cycles can be problematic if COVID-19 is severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has a cytokine activity.China has included tociizumab in the treatment regimen after a small trial.
It is in phase 2 clinical trials that are not from anywhere in Italy after showing results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms, its function is to prevent certain complications that are thought to be fatal in some infected individuals.
The FDA approved the use of an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a case-control study to treat steroid refractory cytokine release signaling caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no random evidence that tocilizumab can treat CRS.
Transfer of purification and collection of antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 infection to people undergoing testing as a non-antibiotic method.
This system was tried for SARS with limited success.
Antibodies are the protective agents that increase the body's immune response to co-protect against SARS-CoV-2.
Other possible pathways include cell-based cytotoxicity and phagocytosis.
Other forms of immunosuppression, for example, use of monoclonal antibodies that are being developed.
convalescent serum, which consists of a liquid blood sample obtained from patients and contains antibodies from the same virus, may be added for early use.
Coronavirus is a group of related diseases.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted the virus and died of COVID-19 after reporting the outbreak.
