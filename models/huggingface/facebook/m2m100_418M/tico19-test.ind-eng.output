The rapidly increasing cumulative incidents of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidents of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed similar trends in countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK which confirmed that, although the levels vary depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic develops very rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italian experience, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should improve their preparation for the rising COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology was in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention the caused agent of the disease is a new coronavirus now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 patients have a mild disease, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients healed.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops to a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases experience critical diseases that require intense treatment.
The mortality rate of patients treated in the hospital due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative COVID-19 incidents trends in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and then compared it to the incidents in the Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy between 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has experienced further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are now following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) General Director declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 released on March 5, Spiteri et al. the first Europeans with COVID-19 case confirmed based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA and UK countries, between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with those dates including, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of the COVID-19 case
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases by each country around the world is updated daily at 8:00 p.m. This number is only obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the country, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO.
These data are used to evaluate the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as to compare it with the trends in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases active, we count the cumulative incidents lasted 14 days, so consider COVID-19 natural travel in each EU/EEA and UK, in the period 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to Italian cases during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 train in the EU/EEA and the UK
The cumulative incident trend 14 days later COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follow the trend in the Hubei Province (China) (Photo 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidents of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February, then sharply rise around 28 February 2020 (Additional Materials).
This trend was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar cumulative COVID-19 incidents increase trend (additives).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data pointed out that, until March 15 at 8 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have the total number of cases compared to the total number of cases Italy three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed at the cumulative COVID-19 incident indicates that the pandemic rises at the same rate in all countries.
This depends on the differences in stages experienced by the countries, the variations in public health responses, and the possible differences in case definition between the countries and the differences in protocols to choose the patient to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, which includes subsequent testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources that hospitals and intensive care units in the region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data of receipt of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive treatment units at EU/EAA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data is not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of intensive care beds and medical care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries could have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 intensive care beds and medical care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario relating to the density of health care capacity, with an estimate of the prevalence of cases of COVID-19 home treatment for each EU/EEA country and the UK related to the risk of >90% exceeding the intensive bed capacity, is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Fast Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since so far cases have been classified in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of the specific regional service coverage, information about cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the Level of Regional Unit Nomination for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic develops very quickly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially intensive care, as happens in the affected areas in Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC Fast Risk Assessment, a quick, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from the blocking approach to the mitigation approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as expected, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, receive, and adapt the correct response if it is not applied before.
This rapid risk assessment also includes public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
A short opportunity window is available as the country has the possibility to further increase its operating efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, other EU/EEA national health care systems will likely face a rise in patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to the homologue virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from the worm and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower rate of severity and mortality than SARS, but more infectious and more in the early age than young people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about this newly emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will discuss the foundations of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although there are still many questions that have not been answered, we hope this review will help understand and relieve this threatening disease.
The summer festival on January 25, 2020 has become a unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay at home for holidays and a few weeks later due to the new viral disease epidemic.
The virus is very homologated with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread throughout the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy of the public” and is potentially more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within less than two months from the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the isolated sequence of the virus from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This survey aims to summarize the research progress in this rapidly developing new subject.
As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, namely the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonethal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% of colds.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have found very pathogenic CoVs for humans twice, namely SARS-CoVs and MERS-CoVs, each causing an initial epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is today the third recorded CoV epidemic in human history.
As shown in Gbr.1.1, the unknown origin of pneumonia cluster was first from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spreads rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a healthcare provider’s infection was, signaling that human-to-human transmission could occur.
On 23 January, the quarantine of the region was enacted in the city of Wuhan and all public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients contacted the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the early place of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time the report was written, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Gbr.
As the situation develops very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the epidemic must still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centered study of 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 COVID-19 patients confirmed, presented the following more updated epidemic picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people in all ages, but especially in the ages of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years old, only a few are under 20 years old, and only 14 infected people are under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in the clusters, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average time of 5 (2-9) days from awakening to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days.
The average time starting from awakening to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4,05) and the customized R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, according to massive transportation times before the Summer Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the suitable mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a massive mixed virus that contains a single point of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genes, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein or spike (S) cover is associated with its cell receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzymes respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of the virus's RNA is released into the cytoplasma; after the replication of the virus's genome, the genome of the RNA is accompanied by the glucoprotein cover and the nucleocapside protein forms a vesicle containing virion, which then experiences a fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic homogeneity of more than 99.98% among the 10 samples followed; the samples were taken from the site of the epidemic, namely the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin epithelial part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV-2 protein associated with human ACE2 is weaker than its bond with SARS-CoV protein, which is in line with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes unparalleled SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins contained with orf3b and proteins secreted with the orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and IFNβ expression inhibition; however, orf8 has no functional domain or known motivation.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. the complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with amino acid B0AT1 carrier.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, structured forming dimer and the complex ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the introduction and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to be derived from pearls and each is transmitted to humans through mushrooms and camels.
Through the philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, mercury is considered to be the original resident of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical with two SARS-like CoVs of mercury called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate property that helps the virus cross the species’ barriers to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. suggested the serpent as a carrier of the virus from the serpent to humans that involves homologue recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that swallowing, long swallowing mammals that are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, could potentially be an intermediary of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology of CoV found in swallowing and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the 1% difference spread throughout the genom is still a big difference; therefore, the conclusive result as concrete evidence is not yet obtained (Gbr.
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant containing chlorine, peracetate acid, chlorform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disactivates the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to this new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study reporting on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr.
In general, after invading the inherent, the virus is recognized by the inherent immune system through pattern-like receptors (PRR), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, viruses induce the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) which restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates the fagositosis of the viral antigen by macrophages.
However, protein N in SARS-CoV can help the virus prevent immune response.
Shortly afterwards, an adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies against the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Assistant T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humorous immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies from healed patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive reactions of the immune system produce a large number of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, failure of the limb organ and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by awitan cluster, more about lansia with participating diseases and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to the virus in large amounts or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is important that the health authorities adjust the effective time of the quarantine based on the most accurate incubation period so that it prevents the infected person, but without symptoms, from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to a virus or infected are usually required to be carantined for 14 days.
Do you need to extend the quarantine time to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptoms of COVID-19, with or without accompanying other symptoms such as dry cough, discomfort, muscle pain, swelling, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnoa and/or hypoxemia a week after the start of the disease.
In severe cases, the development of the disease of the patient progresses rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory and acute fever, even without disorders in lung imaging, should be filtered against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were in two recent studies, namely studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Compared with that, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) are shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support is required for around 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% with confirmed cases reached 66.576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 cases confirmed.
Previous studies that the R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached a height of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 SARS-CoV reached only 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not equal to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Clusters are often found in one family or from one group or vehicles such as a cruise vessel.
Patients often have a history of travel or reside in Wuhan or other affected areas or battle with the infected person or the patient in the last two weeks before awakening.
However, it is that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and the patient returned from the hospital can carry the virus again.
In the early stages, the patient has a normal or decreased number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with the number of white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes the number of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The rate of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as the C-reactive protein and the blood flow rate increases in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer increases, i.e. the fibrin disintegration product in the blood, and the number of lymphocytes decreases gradually.
Torax photo disorders are found in large covers of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral shadows or ground-glass hazards in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tactile inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis significantly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumosite dysfunction decreases the surfacing rate and increases surface pressure so decreases the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lungs collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on the photo of the torace are often parallel to the rate of the most severe disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumosite desquamation, the formation of hyalin membranes, and interstitial lymphocytes infiltration, as well as multiple insitial cells in the lungs of the patient who died due to this disease, according to the pathology of viral infection and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high levels of false negative, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer only depends on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
Similar situations occur in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a necessity to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol of use of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a cellulate in less than one hour without requiring complex instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can significantly improve sensitivity and ease if verified on clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors primarily offer support treatment to COVID-19 patients, as long as they try a variety of therapies used or previously proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current therapy and potential therapy with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of the healed patients is recommended to be used in therapy.
Race pharmaceutical companies develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney system.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat for the patient and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extrakorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a thermodified cardiopulmonary short-term technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, the care of the electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to lead to cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytocin hurricane is a systemic inflammatory response form characterized by the cytocin series release degnan, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the immune cells to release a large number of free radicals which are the main cause of ARDS and failure of the membrane.
Immunosuppression is very important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressed treatments for cytokine storm include the immunosuppressed response modulation directed by T cells; the blockage of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as an immunosuppressant, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for severe lungs in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, steroids can result in severe side effects, especially osteonekrosis, which greatly affect the prognosis.
However, short doses of low to moderate corticosteroids are recommended to be administered with caution to patients with COVID-19 critical illness.
At the time of writing this survey, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, the intraveneous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found nutritious in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Recently, remdesivir also showed a inhibition of other single-untry RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound to China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions may occur after combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications used by the patient should be thoroughly monitored.
Plasma from healed patients and the production of antibodies
There is a long history of blood accumulation of patients who have been healed from a infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from infecting the disease.
In fact, patients who have been healed often have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodium is the immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight the pathogen as well as other strangers, recognize the unique molecules of the pathogen, and directly neutralize it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have been healed from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and viral load as well as an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification should be done to apply such methods for large-scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large amounts to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from healed patients and identify the genetic code that captures effective antibodies or perform effective antibodies filtering against the protein that is essential to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibodies production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the TCM theory.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify that component or its optimal combination.
Currently, as effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not yet available, TCM becomes one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe diseases.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of healing in the treatment of COVID-19 patients was observed in several provinces of China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, which include Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used TCM only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of healing (13%).
However, this comparison remains very brutal because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his friends participated in a study that compared only Western drug therapy (WM) with combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed for the body temperature recovery, the loss of symptoms, and home treatment was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
More impressive, the rate of symptom deterioration (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate is lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for better-controlled testing on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to specify the work mechanism and clarify the effective component in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 feel very afraid of this very infectious and even deadly disease, and the person carantined also feels tired, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor cramps, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even dysidality have ever been.
Tracking the contact history and the mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19, can make people more anxious and feel guilty related to the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19, the suspected people, and the people who bore with them, as well as the general community in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapeutic plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the transmission chain from the reservoir of infected animals and humans to vulnerable habitats and are often complementary to antivirus therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by the appearance of the virus.
The efforts have been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which in the long term and effectively produces penetrative antibodies and/or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, living-weakened vaccines have been evaluated on experimental animals.
However, the in vivo effect of this vaccine candidate on the lansia and the deadly challenge patterns as well as its protection against zoonotic viral infection should still be determined before clinical trials begin.
This is probably because SARS broke down 17 years ago and no new cases have been since that time.
Instead, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued existence of zoonotic sources in the endemic area.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and subunits of recombinant protein and have been partly evaluated on experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome due to the long time to develop the vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just began to show its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In the majority of cases, the patient can surely heal without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the formation of a disease prognosis model is essential for the healthcare body to prioritize its service, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in the ages of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in the study contained 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have complications and complications, as well as significantly older than patients in need of intensive care (median age of 66 years compared to 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the final result of COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0,31/100,000 compared to 0,27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive treatment are more likely to have acute heart injuries and arithmia.
Heart attacks are also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also to be associated with colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 forecast has also been proposed.
In addition, increased laktate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help forecast the final results.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are a traditional indicator for heart and liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Torax photos and the development of temporary clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the final results and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, the steroid is an immunosuppressant which is widely used as a thinning therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survived this disease eventually suffer from avascular osteonekrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used at low doses and short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from extraordinary stress as they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessing the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture of SARS.
In addition to replications in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or unsymptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early stages or times of incubation, infected patients can produce viruses in large amounts during daily activities, which causes great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the patient is severe and most of it does not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, large efforts are being made in China, which includes the quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as the continuous quarantine of the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions greatly damage the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates say the epidemic will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the final outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conca and throat of patients who had been healed and returned from the hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicates that the re-identified virus could be repeated episodes, similar to the flu.
However, promising signs occur in China, if seen on the basis of a decrease in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategy may be successful.
Ebola is expected to cause one million cases with half deaths.
However, with rigorous quarantine and isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Per, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a non-patogenic virus that can be associated with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through cough or swelling, and may also be through direct contact with the substance contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feses so that it triggers the possibility of a new transmission, that is, the transmission of feses-to-mouth.
Recent studies on 138 cases that 41% of cases could be caused by nosocomial infection, which included 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, fair preventive measures should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even people who accidentally collapse with the patient or the infected person.
The first defence line that could be used to reduce the risk of infection was through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (serious number 1860s) helping to control the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask keeps that the scratch of the potentially infected person is not according to the air or attached to the surface of the material, where the scratch of the scratch can be continued to others.
However, only the N95 mask (serious number of the 1860s) can protect against virion inhalations of the smallest size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can fully methhetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can methhetrate even five surgical masks accumulated into one, healthcare providers that contact the patient directly should wear N95 (serie number 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to the mask, health care providers should wear a suitable insulation dress to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus could enter his body through inflammation in the eyes.
Therefore, the healthcare provider should also wear a blind face shield or glasses while working with the patient.
For the general community in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-determination, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is believed to be appropriate to keep a distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologation with SARS-CoV, as on 7 January 2020, must be a big warning for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS epidemic.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that the new virus has a low spread character and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and the prevention and prevention of the disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed the fears of the public, especially as the whole country is preparing the Summer Festival, so this critical time is delayed to prevent the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China should draw lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, the body should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because each word is observed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from the doctor or authorized officer; (3) more restrictive to prevent the potential epidemic at the early stages, rather than to try to calm the public; and (4) more frequently perform targeted and effective exercises to increase the public awareness of the epidemic and test and improve the public response system periodically.
COVID-19 is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began spreading at the end of December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the epidemic has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this survey.
Because the virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 epidemic affects a repeated SARS epidemic.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which is essential to prevent the epidemic and treat the patient.
COVID-19 is more about lansia than young people and more about men than women, as well as a higher rate of death in lansia than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to block the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA acai for SARS-CoV-2 testing can give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, healed patients can give positive results again to the virus examination.
These findings significantly increase the risk of viral spread.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19, some important issues still have to be solved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs, we are still unable to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from the SARS.
What animals are the intermediate species for transmitting viruses from the original inhabitants, say the worms, to humans?
Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we cannot effectively interrupt the transmission and the epidemic can spread again at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical modeling indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how exactly the virus enters the respiratory cells and leads to further pathological changes?
Is this virus also associated with the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, ending like SARS, or repeating periodically like flu?
Answers to the above questions and many other statements are important, but it may take time to find them.
Nevertheless, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible to get back to normal life.
The Zoonotic Virus of the Human Corona
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its buildings, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as selesma.
Early severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and reveal how HCoV infection can be very damaging and life-threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a remark and surprised us with high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis. Therefore, the understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV will be beneficial for us.
The majority of HCoVs come from cattle. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Income reservoir intermediaries of some HCoV have also been known.
The identification of animals has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Research on CoV-income interactions in animals can also provide an important insight into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this survey, we present an overview of the current knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of its discovery as well as its zoonotic origin and interspesial transmission.
Importantly, we compare and illustrate these HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genom recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for a successful transition and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also noted.
The corona virus (CoV) comes from the family of Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of coronaviric, positive, and single-wormed RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genom with a size of 26 to 32 kilobas between the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is corona-like under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has a non-segmented genom that has a similar assessment.
Approximately two-thirds of the genom consists of two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are interconnected.
Polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 non-structualized proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genom consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a spike (S), a tub or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of supplementary proteins specific to a certain line of descendance are also marked by a variety of CoV line of descendance.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoV is classified into four genes (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genes, the beta-CoV genes have the most HCoV and are divided into four line of succession (A, B, C, and D).
Philogenetic evidence suggests that wheat and livestock are a major source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continually crossed the barrier of the species and some CoV has become an important pathogen in humans.
So far, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as cold and/or diarrhea.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infection of the subdual tract in relatively more patients and have higher chances of developing into acute respiratory disorders syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the patient's ginger that had selesma in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through thorough studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both cause symptoms that heal themselves.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmful, until SARS epidemic occurs.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 was one of the most damaging epidemics in today's history, which infected more than 8,000 people with a brutal death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a continued epidemic on the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), further referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has hurt the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm has already sounded and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origin from worms, mice, or pets.
Many evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from pearls. In pearls, CoVs are well adjusted and are nonpatogenic, but show a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has caused an extraordinary medical, scientific, social and moral challenge for China and the whole world.
The zoonotic origin tracking of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force, and the limiting factors of the occurrence of transmissions between species.
The study can also guide or facilitate animal reservoir, mediator, and SARS-CoV-2 amplification search, which has significant implications in the prevention of future spread.
In this survey, we provide a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspesial transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically emphasize and discuss the general topic that the HCoV mother virus is usually non-patogenic in its alamin reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after transmitting interspesial into new habitats.
We also review the evolutionary trends of HCoV that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from the insect of patients affected by selesma, a variety of CoVs have been isolated from a variety of infected animals, which include calkun, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discoveries in chronological sequence (Table 1) is an informative indicator.
Strain HCoV-229E was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients who had an infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to grow on the lung cell line WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of selesma, which include headaches, swelling, swelling, and throat pain, accompanied by fever and coughing that is visible in 10-20% of cases.
Further, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the body culture and sequential series trails in the still breastfeeding scratch brain.
The clinical picture of the HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically undifferentiable with other pathogenic infections of the respiratory tract such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread throughout the world and tend to be the most broadcast during winter in temperate climate areas.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by a pain period of about 2 weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have mild malaria.
Only a few patients with weakened immune system indicate infection of the underweight respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypic pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first SARS case could be investigated back to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths, which spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-infectant, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with the incubation time of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus burden is visible on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, sickness, and swelling, followed by dyspnea, cough, and breathing disorders as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, an abnormal liver function test, and an increase in creatine kinase are a common laboratory disorder in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a sitokin storm, which can be deadly, especially in patients with weak immunity.
The virus was first isolated from the open lungs biopsy of null-patient relatives who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was initially very common in small children, lansia, and patients with weak immunity suffering from respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of corys, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from the nasal sample of a 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of general respiratory diseases and its peak occur in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crupes.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
These four HCoV communities have fully adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into a very pathogenic disease. However, extraordinary cases actually occur due to unknown reasons, such as in the case of the subtype HCoV-NL63 more virulent that has recently been to cause infection of the underweight respiratory tract in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move effectively and continue to defend itself in humans, the virulence and pathogenity of this HCoV also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases come from the Middle East, import cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary incident occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 cases confirmed.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the clinical manifestations of SARS, which is characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were with high cases of death, which was 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most scary viruses known to humans.
In the middle to the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients that are retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the underdeath infection epidemic that is ongoing and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global health emergency and called the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the gross death toll of 3.4%.
It should be noted that cases of death in Hubei, China, were 4.2%, while cases of death outside Hubei were 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and breathing failure.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into an acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they both group into different philogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is clearly lower, but more infectious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoV shows very interesting equations and differences.
First, the incubation time and the duration of the HCoV disease is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCoV Community infection, which includes a picture of mild or even unspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small portion of severe COVID-19 cases may look like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows attractive pattern characteristics, having similarities with the HCoV community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoV community.
On the other hand, a decrease in the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 after several pathways in humans still need to be verified, as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the samples of feses.
"Whether the SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission plays an important role, as in the case of the SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a specific situation, it should still be cleared by further studies."
What is also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the HCoV community case.
In any case, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the transmission capacity, pathogenicity, and continuous spread in several pathways in humans, will greatly influence the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.
The four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be an ancient HCoV pandemic species.
HCoV that causes severe diseases in humans and humans who suffer from severe HCoV disease has been destroyed.
In order to do this, HCoV should be replicated in humans in sufficient amounts to enable the accumulation of adaptive mutations to combat life-restrictive factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic survives and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus fully adapts to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other measures of infection control.
Over the years, four CoV communities circulated in the human population and triggered selesma in people with immunokompetence.
This virus does not require an animal reservoir.
Instead, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot beined.
Both of them must defend themselves and carry out reproduction in zoonotic reservoirs as well as seek the opportunity to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate buildings and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted as HCoV community, at least nowadays.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV community and is not homogeneous to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal building.
Before discussing HCoV animal origin, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, mediator, and HCoV amplification.
Animals act as evolutionary HCoV beings if they have closely related ancestors and share high homologies at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral viruses are usually well adapted and are non-patogenic in these buildings.
Likewise, the reservoir building carries HCoV continuously and over a long period of time.
In these two cases, the herb is naturally infected and is a natural herb for HCoV or the maternal virus.
On the contrary, if the new HCoV enters the intermediate inheritance right before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus is not adapted to the new inheritance and is often pathogenic.
This mediator can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a role as an amplifier by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV may be infected if it is unable to maintain its transmission in the mediator.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to the intermediate and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate building becomes the natural reservoir building.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospective that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with pets.
Further seroprevalence studies indicate that the sellers of the animals have a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The lunar worms (Paguma larvata) and rabbit dogs in the live animal market are the first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been since all the mushrooms on the market were killed.
Therefore, it is that the moon mushrooms from wildlife or farms that are not exposed to the market of the living animals mostly give negative test results for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the moon mushrooms may only act as an intermediate amplification building, but not a natural resorvoir for SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be excepted that many small species of mammals also serve as SARS-CoV intermediate amplification injectors.
All of these buildings seem to be the final buildings of SARS-CoV.
The search for natural animals for SARS-CoV further reveals a close-friendly coV, called the coV Rhinolopus family-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the Chinese horse tapal coat.
This drug gives positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These CoVs and other coVs share the 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoVs.
The study became the foundation for a new concept that the mercury is the building for the newly emerging human pathogen.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also identified from the worms, but only one, called WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 that originates from the samples of the mercury is shown to use ACE2 mercury, mushrooms, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the SARS patient's serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest-friendly ancestor to SARS-CoV in the wheat, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct maternal virus of SARS-CoV and it is not the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis group MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 mercury.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same inhaled receptor, i.e. peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the entrance pathway of the virus.
The sequence of polymerase-dependent MERS-CoV RNA is filogenetically closer to its equivalent in the identified beta-CoV in Europe and Africa.
Until now, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bears.
MERS-CoV and its closest coV-HKU25 relatives share only 87% of the homology of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the wire may not be the MERS-CoV direct reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East showed that Arab camels give a seropositive result to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like camels from the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the Arab camel nasal usap. This further indicates that the camel is the real reservoir of the MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral pollution with symptoms that are usually mild is observed on experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that the infected camel sends the virus not only through the respiratory path, but also through the fekal-oral path, which is also the main path of the viral transmission from the worm.
Nevertheless, the question has not yet been answered because many confirmed MERS cases have not had a history of contact with camels before the symptoms appear, the probability of a human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission route involving unknown species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 coV that is isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis coV.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too big to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, the mercury may not be a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, unless the near identical mercury CoV is found later.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animals are among the species of wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, which indicates the possibility of the occurrence of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequence show that a small group of extinction-threatened mammals, known as trenggiling (Sweet javanica), may also bear an ancestor beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new coV trigger genome shares 85-92% homology of nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is equally close to the RaTG13 with a 90% equality in the sequence rate of the nucleotide.
Both are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the philogenetic tree, one sharing the receptor bonding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence equal.
Surprisingly, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBD are far more different, although the homological sequence rate of the entire genom is higher.
Previous studies on sick glanding also detection of contig virus from lung samples, which also found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different arrangement and manual curation methods to produce a partial genom sequence consisting of about 86.3% of the complete virus genom.
We cannot exclude the possibility of trenggiling as one of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal buildings.
However, at the moment there is no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from swelling due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 swelling.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in pearls, pimples, and other mammals is still to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology on RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-related-SARS-CoV-2 trenggiling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology on the entire genom sequence level.
It is too speculative if it is said that the high rate of similarity between the beta-CoV-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the convergence evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The comparative hypothesis supports the recombination between beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As an evolutionary factor, many recombinations occur among beta-CoVs.
The researchers are still unable to determine the origin of the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Philogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from coV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 indigenous viruses have been found in pesticides.
It is that the ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) coV detected in the North American three-colored coevers showed close frequency to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically associated with other coVs, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also believed to be a living among them.
To make it clearer, the current knowledge of the known HCoV animal origin is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of interspesial HCoV transmission in history.
About 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species of livestock to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infection was.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E interspesies is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV, which is associated with HCoV-229E, has been discovered.
Among them, there is alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from worms to humans.
First of all, humans, not alpaca, who may battle with the marble in a joint ecological shell.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpaca.
Secondly, the alpha-CoV, which is associated with HCoV-229E, is diverse and non-patogenic in the alpha, while the alpha-CoV causes a respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Ultimately, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting alpha-CoV-HCoV-229E relatives from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, worms are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not so surprising that the worms may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while the alpha-CoV is functioning as a HCoV-229E gen, the alpha and Arab camels may serve as a mediator that transmits the virus to humans, exactly like the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of transmitting interspesies from cattle to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV is known in the early identification of the virus and is also strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that cranberries are a plumber of a rich viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long age, closely organized colonies, close social interactions, and strong flight capabilities, all are the supporting conditions for the worms to become an ideal ‘virus spread’.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered the Arab camel for decades.
The virus has been adapted to the camels that have changed from the intermediate building to the stable and natural reservoir building.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease andins a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
The spontaneous transmission to humans occurs by coincidence and humans remain the final creature for MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be continued.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of scratching, if there is, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially, beta-CoV scratching is very pathogenic in scratching.
Toughened Laminated Safety Glass may be the final injection for the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to the injection in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be taken into account or excluded.
First, it can be a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 relatives that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings can share the ecological wire with the wire through the murder or mining of wire stones.
Second, trenggiling may be one of the intermediate amplification inings for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and consumption of fisherman’s meat.
Per, many mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibodies to animal and wild animals should be examined.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that bite both with the wheat and the wheat.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin is still ongoing.
Despite the various types of animal habitat, three main factors on the viral side are also important to facilitate CoV passing through the species barriers.
First, its mutation rate is relatively high in the RNA replication.
Compared to other single-wheeled RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered “sized” to “high” with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per site, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to the new building.
CoV has correction exoribonuclease, elimination that results in extremely high mutability, atenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress the CoV replication through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and the RNA polymerase depending on the RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its mutation.
Moreover, the rate of mutations is often high when the CoV is not adapted to the inches.
Compared to SARS-CoV that has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is actually lower, indicating a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other buildings that are close to human relationships.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has been adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, there is little possibility that genetic outbreak will quickly make the vaccine and antivirus agent against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genom in CoV gives additional flexibility in genom modification, for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspesial co-evolutions, which is beneficial for the appearance of new CoV when the conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by a lot of unique open reading framework and protein function that is encrypted towards the end of the 3′ genom.
Third, CoV regularly changes the template randomly during the RNA replication through the unique “selection-copy” mechanism.
In the inches that serve as a mixing container, wire transitions occur frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete and highly homologated subgenomic RNA can experience recombination to form a new CoV.
The philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoV such as SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of viruses in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the indigenous receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission between species.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the occurrence of interspesial transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and mushroom SARS-CoV insulates, SARS-CoV is supposed to experience rapid adaptation in a variety of insulates, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
In general, S CoV protein RBD interacts with the cell receptors and is intentionally targeted by the antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the fragment S1, which connects with human ACE2 as well as its receptor as the entrance of the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of a variety of animals, which include worms, mushrooms, mice, and rabbits, thus enabling the transmission of interspesial viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed different between human virus and mushroom insulates in RBD and 4 of them are located on the motivation of the receptor bonding for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV mushroom has mutations of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of tonic protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S units implies that the affinity of S protein bonding with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the affinity of human ACE2 and S protein SARS-CoV-2 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S protein SARS-CoV.
What is also important to know is whether there are other receptors that may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2..
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teracetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the interspesial transmission of their animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the final result of interspesial HCoV transmission is also regulated by other dependency factors and limitations.
These protein differences between humans and natural reservoirs, such as pearls, Arab camels, and frogs, can be an obstacle to interspesial transmission.
HCoV must take over the inherent dependence factor and blur the inherent restriction factor in order to succeed in interspesial transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the field of these important viral interactions must still be identified and characterized.
Filtering the entire genome of unparalleled to see the dependency factors and the limitation of the SARS-CoV-2 life using the advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to the beginning of the epidemic
The diversity of CoV cranes gives a great opportunity for the appearance of new HCoVs.
In this case, CoV acetate acts as a HCoV gene discharge.
Furthermore, rapid mutations and genetic recombinations also drive the evolution of HCoV and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein receptor genes may potentially dramatically modify the viral phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV protein accessories, ORF8 is supposed to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated SARS-CoV viruses found to host a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a specific characteristic of the elimination of 29 nucleotide found on isolated strains at the beginning of human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is supposed to be an adaptive mutation that supports the transition.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV descent lines, with a large number of smaller recombination areas identified in the RNA polymerase depending on the RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, the occurrence of recombination between the various line of descendants shown occurred at the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the incidence of recombination has also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoV experiences recombination with other animal CoVs in its non-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can play a role in unintentional changes in the viral genom, most likely resulting from the release of the virus from the selected pressure, such as by the immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the prototype HCoV-229E strain due to the elimination of two nucleotide.
While full ORF4 can be observed on the worms and camels that are associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca indicates a single nucleotide injection that leads to a frame shift.
Lastly, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by the selective pressure in its reservoir building.
Light or unsymptomatic symptoms are detected when the worm is infected with CoV, which indicates mutual adaptation between CoV and the worm.
It appears that the worms adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a deficiency in the activation of the proinflammatory response in the wheat will effectively reduce the pathology caused by CoV.
Furthermore, the activity of natural killer cells on the worms is under pressure due to increased regulation of the receptor of natural killer cells inhibitors NKG2/CD94 and low levels of complex molecular expression of the main histokompatibility of class I.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of the high metabolic activity of the mercury can suppress CoV replication and affect the correction by exoribonuclease so giving selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic viral strains when entering the new building.
More pathogenic CoV strain may also develop through recombination, which leads to the acquisition of protein or new protein features for inherent adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpatogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir houses, such as worms and camels.
CoV reacts strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
Here is the secret of the presence of a carrier without symptoms and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
The symptoms are mainly due to excessive immune response activation as well as cytokine storms, with more severe lungs damage if the immune response is stronger.
Instead, in the non-symptomatic carrier, the immune response has been missed regardless of the CoV replication.
The same strategy to resolve the linkability of immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses are especially strong on the wheat.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflamasome NLRP3 in the wheat is defective.
For this reason, the inhibition of the inflamasome NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general flow of the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV molecules that share 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also coV molecules that share 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although mushrooms and other animals on the market were found to carry the same viruses as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediary of SARS-CoV-2 was not found.
A very homologated beta-CoV trigger with SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, which indicates that trigger may play a role as one of the intermediates or beta-CoV trigger may contribute to the fragment of the gene to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although it is still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
CoV returned to the center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
CoV studies in cattle and other animals have dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCoV in human transmission.
A lot of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from the mercury and are transmitted to humans through a mediator.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between humans and mushrooms in the wet market, the closure of the wet market and the murder of all mushrooms in it may effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, trenggiling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of a number of beta-CoV tribal lines of trenggiling close to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to humans through scratching and other mammals still need to be cleared in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in the Arab camel.
This stone serves as an important transportation tool as well as a major source for meat, milk, skin, and wol products for the local community.
Arab stones are widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all the camels to control MERS, as is done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS epidemic, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other measures of infection control.
Before we succeed in removing this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an epidemic.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the potential zoonotic coV is very diverse.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which leads to the appearance of new CoVs that are more easily transmitted and/or more fatal for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the gorgeous experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparations and retaliation plans should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet for a long time.
These viruses are in their alamin reservoir until there is a chance to spread.
Though worms have many characteristics that support the spread of viruses, the chances of human battle with worms and other wild species can be minimized if people are displaced to get away from wild animals.
Continuous surveillance of mammals should be carried out to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural habitat, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the zoonosis of the virus is that humans should keep a distance from the ecological reservoir of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if the worms transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to the worms, the condition when the worms and the worms share the organic worms is important to know.
Secondly, if the worms have a more direct role in the transmission to humans, the way humans bite with the worms should be determined.
Thirdly, if there is a third mammal that plays the role of the real intermediary, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which includes humans, pearls, and pearls should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be carried out.
Regardless of the pineapple, pineapple, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical maternal virus may be identified in its future alamines.
Continued research in this field will dissolve the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The update of the diagnostic criteria “predictable case” and “confirmed case” COVID-19 must be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and becomes a good reference to fighting pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuing to be updated.
In this letter, we answer one of the comments in our guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “predictable cases” and “confirmed cases” based on the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an epidemic, which is currently formally called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus is named the coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance and the guidelines were published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuing to be updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the Commission has issued a total of seven editions with some context has been modified quite much.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal to give simple scores based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidelines as well as becomes a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work results also require updates based on the Diagnostic and Treatment Guide for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh test version) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the expected case is required a combination of one of the epidemiological history images with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or the completion of three clinical manifestations is required if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been in the last 14 days before the symptoms occur; (2) history of contact with the SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been in the last 14 days before the symptoms occur; (4) history of contact with the cluster of cases confirmed (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells indicates a normal number of lymphocytes, decreased, or decreased at the early awakening stage.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on the expected case with one of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire viral genom sequence indicates high homogenity for new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or the change of specific IgG antibodies-SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or the titer increases ≥4 times in the recovery phase above the rate in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nuclear acid in the respiratory or blood tract samples was added on the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the researchers’ ongoing research to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory tract including blood intake, which increases the availability of various samples, and supports the participation of positive results of certain antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, there are more and more evidence that reminds us to alert patients with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al. flows should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The score system should also be verified in future practice and clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of “predictable cases” and “confirmed cases”, we advise to follow and follow the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also periodically update our guidelines as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily deaths
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh the number of cases of infection recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cases of healing living at home.
There were 17 deaths.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport will be stopped longer than planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport stop has begun since March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of trees - medical, fuel, and food - is still permitted.
The first incident of COVID-19 infection recorded in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two newly returned people from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19th, the three people were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more than one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia experienced its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from coronavirus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1.051.635 confirmed cases, including 79.332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there were more than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus, which resulted in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office, which quoted data from Johns Hopkins University, there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infection.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow mayor, extended the quarantine of the territory to 1 May.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that Russian citizens will remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament held a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes for, ten votes abstain, and one votes for.
Saudi Arabia extended the night clock in the holy towns of Mekka and Medina to the whole day; previously, the night clock was only between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to apply a night time between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended the residence order until May 1.
Australian shops reduce the boundary for the purchase of toilet fabric per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian Woolworth and Coles store networks respectively reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet fabric to two and one packs per transaction in all stores at national level.
ALDI also applies the limit of one pack, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the kasir and on the Facebook page of its network.
Buyers were to accumulate supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 if the public had to do independent isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet fabric for delivery to the home to one pack per order.
The change followed the limitation of four packs per transaction which was previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
In a media statement on March 8, Coles that with the implementation of the restrictions on the four packs, “many stores are still out within an hour since delivery”, and said the request “not ever happened before”, while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it “unpredictable”.
Sales "growed sharply" last week, according to one spokesman Woolworths.
Costco stores in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid disappointment, Coles orders larger packaging from the supplier and increases the frequency of delivery, Woolworths orders additional supplies, while ALDI makes supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Commercial Association, said that the merchants are trying to increase the supply, but the limitations of local government bodies for the time of delivery of trucks make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as long as suppliers seek to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because it had released supplies early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills the supplies every night.
It emphasizes that toilet tissues are goods with a large volume so that the amount of supply is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of empty space on the rocks so that the weakness of the goods becomes more sensitive.
Coles and Woolworths argued [that] if there were a lot of items on the rack, if products such as toilet tissue and sanitation could be [buy] and there were in large amounts, panic could be minimized, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News Office.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet fabric Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of supply.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who made the Sorbent, emphasized they worked 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some real estate sellers offer free toilet tissue to the first auction in Melbourne, while fewer auctions are held because buyers take a bid for a long weekend vacation.
The NT News Thursday edition, a daily printed in Darwin, contains eight pages of inscriptions intended to be cut and used as toilet fabric.
The stores actually refused to apply the restrictions, according to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, they said they didn’t plan to apply the restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, cleansing, dried food, handwashed soap, and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the UK online supermarket Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" merely refers to how broad the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case, the WHO notes the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change the path of this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, deals, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We are very vigilant due to the level of spread and worried severity as well as due to the level of frequency of worried actions.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a report published by CNN in February, “except for influenza, no respiratory virus has ever been traced from its appearance to its continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, “and we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new status of the pandemic followed the WHO’s decision in January that stated the epidemic as a catastrophe of the world.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic, "it hopes, the epidemic will worsen."
Until Thursday, Associated Press there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that is ongoing and caused by the coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Wabah identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a World Public Health Disadvantage on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Around 364,000 people have been healed.
The number of deaths is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13,04% to 0,08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing discomfort.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
The time from exposure to the start of the symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antivirus treatments.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive actions include washing hands, closing the mouth during cough, keeping a distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation of people expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by applying travel restrictions, quarantines, night hours, workplace hazard control, and facility closure.
This pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and the extent of the weak supply of goods that is aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, which affects about 99.4 percent of the student population around the world.
Misinformation about this virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with descendants and appearances in East and Southeast Asia, and people who come from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
The health authority in Wuhan, China (Hubei propincy capital), a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and the investigation was carried out at the beginning of January 2020.
These cases are largely related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is supposed to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, the newly discovered virus and associated with coronavirus, coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with the symptoms was later known to get sick on 1 December 2019, and the person had no clear connection to the moist market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial case clusters in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced on November 17, 2019, on a 55-year-old from the Hubei province, is likely to be the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO that, with new cases decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China has exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a large number of cases that are not, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, a relatively small number of cases among young people, with people under 19 years of age forming 2.4% of cases worldwide. British chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
Until March 23, no country tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, it is estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is expected to be greater than the case.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was likely to be 5.7.
The majority of COVID-19 patients are healed.
For those who are not healed, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19.
In China, until February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75% have previously existing health disorders, which include cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official death calculation due to COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the people who gave the positive test results for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual number of fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official numbers are likely not to include the people who died without testing, for example, at home, in the home of care, etc.
Parcial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during a pandemic exceeded the official COVID death estimates with a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged, "We know [the number of announced deaths] is lower than the actual figure," a statement strengthened by non-scientific reports about the calculations too low in the U.S. Too low calculations often appear in pandemies, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside of China land occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Until March 13, more than forty countries and territorial territories have deaths, on each continent, except for the Antarctica.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time, as well as influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, the treatment options, the time since the first epidemic, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and health as a whole. Death ratio to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the mortality rate for cases globally was 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) by 10 April 2020.
These numbers vary according to the area.
In China, the estimated mortality rate for cases decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptom awakening 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom awakening after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality figure (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died from a certain disease, and the infection fatality figure (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a certain disease.
These statistics are not timely bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of infection fatalities for a total pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top limit of this estimated range corresponds to the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical summary that analyzes the impact of the follow-up on the CFR estimates.
The WHO says this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of the duration of the epidemic is unclear and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University said, “Uncontrolled, the infectious epidemic is usually vertical and then begins to decrease as the disease is out of its available habitat.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable forecast at the moment about when it happens.”
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argues that "this epidemic may end in June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow the WHO's advice on the steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, likely to be up to one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until the vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's little likely that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear completely" and this disease "may be transformed into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Repeated virulence will depend on the group immunity and the rate of mutations.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and the infected person may be without any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, breathing sputum production (flegma), loss of absorption, breathing discomfort, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headache, swelling, vomiting, hemopathy, diarrhea, or sianosis. WHO that about one in six people become severe and experience breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, stressed chest or sitting chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bleeding on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory disorder syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people infected may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with the results of tests that confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers suggest that those who are in close contact with the people who have been confirmed infected should be strictly monitored and checked to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimates that the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) usually ranges between 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lose their absorption power initially is 30%, then decreases to 15%.
Details about how the disease spreads are still being investigated.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur mainly at the time of close contact and through small droplets produced during cough, swelling, or speaking; close contact is contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that uncovered cough could cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although this virus is not generally transmitted through the air.
Droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of a person who is near it or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretions transform into aerosols and then spread through the air.
The spread can also occur when a person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government identified the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Virus is most infectious in the first three days after the symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and at the further stage of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the symptoms begin, which indicates the transmission may occur before the occurrence of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases are laboratoryally confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during the contact search investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected up to three days on plastic (polipropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day on the cardus, and more than four hours on the copper.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature. Animal and other animals have been tested positively COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have already been touched by the infected person.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the cluster of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective amplop. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus was genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line of descent B) along with two gallons of sequence.
The virus has a 96% homogeneity in the entire genom level with other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference in one amino acid in certain parts of the genomic sequence between angina and human viruses.
Until now, the overall genom comparison found that there was the most 92% of the genetic material homogeneity between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the coronavirus is the mediator in SARS-CoV-2.
Infections by viruses can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but confirmation at the end is done through a re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the infected secretion or through CT imaging.
A study that compared PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a lot of imaging features that matched pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first distributed on January 17.
Testing using real-time re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done on breathing or blood samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on nasopharing usps, but throat usps can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
By April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to approve its widespread use.
In the US, the serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of computed radiographic and tomographic imaging (CT) characteristics in symtomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass hazards and no pleura effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is preparing an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because it is interconnected with other infections such as adenovirus, non-confirmed PCR images have limited specificities in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a filtering tool in the epidemic area.
Artificial intelligence-based convergence neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of this disease include keeping good personal hygiene comprehensively, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue when coughing or swallowing, and immediately throwing tissue into the waste.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in a public place.
The government in various regions has restricted or urged to stop all non-essential travel to and from the countries and regions affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached a stage of public scale spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread throughout the community, and some members of the community don’t know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers that deal with people who may be infected are advised to take standard preventive measures, contact preventive measures, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile data by the government for this purpose has triggered a privacy issue, with the release of a statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for such surveillance restrictions.
A variety of mobile applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntarily, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts work on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the user’s distance to other phones.
Furthermore, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who has been tested positively for COVID-19.Promoting misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, swallowing the nose and swallowing with the drug is ineffective.
There is no vaccine COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after swallowing the nose, cough, or swallowing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that damages its protective layer.
Additionally, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitation with alcohol content at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be contaminated using a number of solutions (in one minute of disinfected exposure to the surface of stainless steel), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochloride 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide 0,5%, and povidone-iodine 0,2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a predictable or confirmed case of COVID in public facilities, such as the office or the place of childbirth, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, joint electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboard, remote control, and ATMs used by the patient, should be infected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and nose with tightened edges or use tissue when coughing or swallowing, and then immediately remove the tissue.
A surgical mask is recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the expiratory droplets spread during speech, swelling, and cough.
The WHO has issued instructions on the time and way of using the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Using a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with not clean hands, which is the main source of transmission.”The mask is also recommended to be used by people who treat others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends that healthy people use the mask only if they are at high risk, such as those who treat COVID-19, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing the mask can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the community.
In the US, CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric. Chinese specifically recommends the use of once-used medical masks to healthy communities, especially when close (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of a surgical mask while using public transportation or living in a crowded place.
The Thai health office advises people to make a fabric mask at home and wash it every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned its people from going to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone who enters the toserba to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all its citizens to wear face masks while in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, has forced rail and intercity bus passengers to wear face masks by 1 April.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the house, as well as recommends making home-made face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restrictions (also called physical restrictions) are an infection control action intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
The method of social restriction includes quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centers.
People can apply methods of social restriction by living at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using uncontact greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Today, many governments impose or impose social restrictions in the areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if there is no distribution of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Anxiety and people with basic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and disrupted immune system that have a risk of serious diseases and higher complications CDC recommended to as much as possible at home alone in areas that suffer from an epidemic at the community level. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social restriction" to "physical restriction", to clarify that its objective is to reduce physical contact byining social relationships, either virtually or from a distance.
The use of the term "social restrictions" impresses that people must isolate themselves fully socially and do not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines for sexual health to be used during pandemic times.
This recommendation includes an order to have sex only with people who live with you and have no viruses or viral symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected to be infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper independent isolation. Many governments require or recommend independent quarantines for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The most strict independent quarantine instructions are issued for people belonging to a high-risk group.
People who are likely to be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently travelled to a country or territory with a wide spread of COVID-19 are advised to do an independent quarantine for 14 days from the time of the possible last exposure.
Strategy in the control of the epidemic is blocking or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to track and isolate the infected people as well as to take other measures for the control of infection and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, further efforts move to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow down the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and the public.
A combination of blocking and mitigation actions can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1.The part of the management of the epidemic of infectious diseases is seeking to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known to hit the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of breach on health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatment.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the epidemic include individual preventive actions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and independent quarantines; measures at the community level aimed at physical restrictions, such as shut down schools and annulling mass meetings; public engagement to encourage reception and participation in such interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleansing. Other drastic actions aimed at preventing the epidemic are carried out in China as the severity of the epidemic is increasingly manifest, such as arrangeing the entire city and imposing strict travel prohibitions.
Other countries also implement a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass filtration and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to infected people who perform independent quarantines and imposes a huge penalty on those who fail to do so.
Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (later, but does not stop the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (return the growth of the epidemic) have a big challenge.
An optimal mitigation policy could reduce the peak of health care demand to 2/3 and deaths to half, but it still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Suppression can be selected, but it must beined as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is first achieved), because otherwise, the transmission will jump back quickly as the suppression steps are calmed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have a social and economic impact.
There are no specific antivirus medications approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are being carried out, which includes the existing drug testing.
Consuming flu drugs sold freely, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity level, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition of the patient.
Some previously approved compounds for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also stated that some “traditional and household treatments” can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in responding to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the European Regional WHO Office have issued guidelines for primary hospitals and health services to transfer resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if it allows the cancellation of elective procedures, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (which is called zero patient).
The first known new coronavirus case can be investigated on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are largely related to the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these species of animals; or, in other words, the virus has zoonotic origin. A cluster of pneumonia with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who told the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false spots, and the others, Ai Fen, were rejected by his head for the warning he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed the WHO.
A lot of unknown cases of pneumonia were to the health authorities in Wuhan which subsequently launched the investigation at the beginning of January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases increased twice every seven and a half days.

On 23 January, in response to the central government’s decision to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the measure was “clear not the WHO recommendation,” but the measure was also “a very important indication of the commitment to preventing the epidemic where the epidemic was most concentrated” and he called it “no time before in the history of public health.”On 30 January, after confirming the transmission of humans to humans outside China and increasing the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the epidemic as the Worldwide Public Health Reduction (PHEIC), which is the sixth PHEIC since the first measure was taken during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared due to the “risk of global spread, especially to low-income and middle-income countries that have not a well-established health system.

The Chinese government has received criticism from the U.S., British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for the initial pandemic treatment in the Hubei province, China.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed in connection with the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in dealing with the epidemic in the region.
Some commentators believe that the move is intended to protect the Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger related to the coronavirus epidemic.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the previous recognition of the early coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan, and supported the conspiracy theory of COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The U.S. government Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “China virus” or “Wuhan virus” and said that “Chinese closed action gives strength to the virus that is now transformed into a global pandemic.”
The Daily Beast received a message from the U.S. government that describes the communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Council, with the strategy quoted as "All about China.
We are told to try and transmit this message in any way possible, including press conferences and showing on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send help to the countries affected by the virus are part of the propaganda incentive to influence the world.

On March 22, after receiving a telephone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops to send military medical personnel, special disinfecting vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" saying that 80 percent of Russian aid "is useless or little useful to Italy."
The source accused Russia of carrying out a charming "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sends cargo aircraft containing medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get the opportunity, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO’s “Defender 2020” military exercises scheduled in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, these exercises are not only harmful to the lives of U.S. troops and many participating European countries, but also the population of the country where they operate.”The Iranian government is very seriously affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliamentarians infected with fifteen current or previous political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to the world's leaders to ask for help and said that his country has difficulty fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to the international market as a result of the U.S. sanctions against Iran. This incident has encouraged the U.S. to adopt a common social policy in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family holidays, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts suspect that this could have a negative impact on the possibility of Donald Trump to be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea has criticized "the ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine" after Japan announced that every person coming from South Korea will be placed in a two-week quarantine in a place designated by the government.

Many Koreans have signed a petition, either calling for the Moon's rejection, on the basis of their claims about the government's mistakes in dealing with the epidemic, or praising its acceptance. Pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by adopting an emergency law.
Some commentators expressed concerns that it could allow the government to strengthen its strength over power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule through unlimited decrees, delay parliament and general elections, as well as punish people who are considered to spread false information about viruses and crisis management by the government.
The coronavirus has been charged with a lack of supply, which arises from the increased use of equipment globally to combat epidemics, panic purchases, and factory and logistics operations disruptions.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about the lack of medications and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disturbances in suppliers.
Some areas also experience purchases due to panic that leads to the emptiness of the trees, such as food, toilet tissue, and bottle water, which causes a lack of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the delay in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand resulted in a price rise up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a four to six-month delay in the supply of medical goods.
This also causes a lack of self-protection tools around the world, and the WHO warns that this will harm health energy.
In Australia, the pandemic provides a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in the weakness of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were avoided from food deficiency.
The actions of China and Italy in the fight against the accumulation and illegal trade of important products have succeeded so that the expected acute food deficiency will occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its massive agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices can rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food rocks were only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials dismissed the surplus of pig meat to ensure the nutrition of the public.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep reserves for such emergency conditions.
The global economic decline has been perceived in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China has been severely hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of the government’s measures to stop the spread of the virus, and the retail sales of anthrop is 20.5%.
Since China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus epidemic is considered to be a major threat of destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will continue to slide until there is a clearer picture of the potential final outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of epidemic economic decline on global growth could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
An estimate from experts at the University of Washington in St. Louis says the epidemic affected more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of Land Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has a "country" after the oil prices have experienced a sharp decline as a result of a decrease in demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China's mainland.
On February 27, due to increased concerns about the coronavirus epidemic, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1.191 points, the largest one-day decline since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indices closed a week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government’s credit rating, butined the Outlook Negative.
The shares dropped again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest decline occurred on March 16.
Many people think the economic recession may happen.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central and state bank’s timely emergency measures.
Central banks react faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel ban, public locations closing including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the trail industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with Imlek New Year's holidays.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and regional governments, including the annual Imlek New Year festival, and private companies also independently shut shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Imlek New Year events and tourist sites are closed to prevent mass encounters, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, cities, and provinces of China, authorities extended New Year’s holidays to 10 February and ordered most of the workplaces not to be reopened until that date.
These regions are the producer of 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased the suspension of infectious diseases to the highest levels and announced emergency conditions, closed schools until March, and canceled the New Year's celebration.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
The markets in North America and the Middle East had a 50-60% decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Operators of expenditure centers around the world are taking additional measures, such as improving sanitation, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of the buyer, and the cancellation of the event. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost jobs.
Most of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers are left home in an inner province or are caught in the Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lose their jobs and apply for government aid.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus epidemic could lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. the territorial quarantine in India caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada suffered some kind of loss of jobs. Nearly 900,000 workers lost jobs in Spain since they carried out the territorial quarantine in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers submitted temporary unemployment allowances and 1 million British workers submitted a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted a short-term government-subsidized work scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and the UK.
Worldwide, the show art and cultural heritage sectors are greatly affected by the pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent.
Organizations of the art and culture sector strive to highlight their mission (which is often funded by the public) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, safeguard the safety of employees and the community, and support artists if possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, exhibition sites, and other cultural institutions will be closed unlimited, with exhibitions, events, and exhibitions cancelled or delayed.
In response, intense efforts are spread to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The other harmful effects of this recent and very rapidly developing disease are the cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, as well as fashion care.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Paschal Christian Revenge, was cancelled.
Many churches encourage Christians to stay at home and not attend the Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, live broadcasts or television, while others offer drive-in or charter worship.
With the closure of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic Church and the emptiness of St. Peter's Square from Christian visitors, other religious bodies also canceled the service and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gardens.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayer in the areas affected by the epidemic and the places of worship were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign visitors and their inhabitants from entering holy places in Mekka and Medina.
This pandemic caused the most significant disturbance to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or delayed, including UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA season 2019-2020, and NHL season 2019-2020.
The Wabah rejects the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was initially planned to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "replanned until after 2020, but will not be more than the summer of 2021."Around the world, casinos and other games are closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments are delayed or cancelled.
This causes many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delayed or canceled concert tours.
Many big theatres like Broadway also delayed all the shows.
Artists explore a variety of ways to continue producing and sharing works through the internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live broadcast concerts or making a web-based "festival" for artists to show, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many coronavirus-themed internet memes are spread online with a lot of people switching to humor and distorting attention in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the spread of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese and Eastern Asian descendants, as well as against people from the affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Fear, suspicion, and hostility incidents are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific regions.
A February report (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) recorded the racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve to receive the virus or accept what they claim as an adequate reward.
Some countries in Africa also experience an increased anti-China sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei report discrimination due to their territory.
There is already support for Chinese people, both online and luring, and for people in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the epidemic to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to prohibit Chinese entering their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag becomes a trend on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States an increased rate of racist abuse and assault.

Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which bound with China, and studying in major Indian cities have been to have experienced a coronavirus-related abuse.
Bharatiya Party President Janata State Unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "this is why God revenge them."
The statement was subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "missible."In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people broke out due to a pandemic, with foreigners described as "strangers' lies" and targeted for "production".
Many newspapers using a paid blockage have removed it for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the epidemic available with open access.

Laboratory tests for respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect the antibodies produced as a response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
This test is used to confirm a new or still active infection.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for the diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Anticorps tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to be or who have no symptoms.
The accurate number of disease mortality and the rate of group immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Due to the limited testing, until March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23, no country tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a huge variation in the number of tests that the countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of fatalities in cases, which are likely to be counted too high in some countries.
Using a real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on breathing samples obtained by a variety of methods, including nasopharing usap or sputum samples.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on throat usps can only be reliable in the first week of the disease.
Therefore, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for the infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the inner respiratory tract using a swallow kateter or the material that is removed through the cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech will develop a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) clinical-level detection device on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tools. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes the New Real-Time Coronavirus 2019 RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests on the old version of the test device gave uncertain results due to a reactor error, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to perform the tests.
The test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Supervisory Authority on the basis of the Emergency Use Authority. U.S. Commercial Laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Likewise, Quest Diagnostics made the COVID-19 testing available nationally on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limit is announced; the collection and processing of the samples must be carried out in accordance with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Center of the Virology and Biotechnology Division VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was to develop a test to detect COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA approval for tests that can be done within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nuclear acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Because it does not require a series of temperature change cycles, this method can give a positive result in only five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott predicts to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the new coronavirus protein nucleocapside (protein N) are being developed in Taiwan, hoping to deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes like a quick influenza test.
A library survey published in March 2020 concluded that “torax photos had a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings [computed tomography] may have already existed before the symptoms occur.”
Specific features on CT include bilateral ground-glass danger with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
The domination of subpleura, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease develops.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many imaging features matched with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for early filtering.
The part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals for about 7 days after the symptoms occur, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Exam can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care test (PoCT).
High-performance automatic systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, one peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although a series of samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, one peripheral blood sample is commonly used obtained through skin thinning.
Unlike the PCR method, extract steps are not required before the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 institutions that provide notifications to the agency as required and therefore can now distribute their antibodies test.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European approval for their test tools that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Its test capacity is up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR testing for the virus RNA.
Antibody is usually detected 14 days after the start of the infection.At the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the antibodies it bought was good enough to use.
Hong Kong has drawn up a scheme so that the expected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient," they lay into it, send it back, and get the test results a few seconds later. NHS UK announces that NHS is pioneering the scheme of the expected case testing at home so that it eliminates the risk of the patient to infect another person if they come to the hospital or have to infect an ambulance if used. At the continuous test for the expected case COVID-19, a professional health personnel will take the sample using appropriate preventive measures.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in road care settings and 10,700 tests were performed in the previous week.
The cost is charged by the health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19th, landature tests were offered in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples were tested until and included week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6,9%) were tested positively for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested methods to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if combined samples were found positive.In Wuhan, an emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square meters named "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火 眼, or "Mate of Fire" in Indonesian) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction supervised by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and took 5 days, the modeling showed that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the related cost for quarantine handling could double if this test capacity was not available.
The Wuhan Laboratory was immediately followed by the Huo-Yan Laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open-source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patients samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be carried out in a small laboratory without the need for robotic liquid handling.
Until March, the lack and insufficient number of reagents have been a barrier for mass testing in the European Union, the UK, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers are trying to explore the sample preparation protocol involving sample warming at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genom for further testing. On March 31, the UAEly conducted more coronavirus tests per capita than any country, and ready to increase the test scale to reach the majority of the population.
This is achieved through a combination of random testing and the acquisition of mass-scale laboratory results from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside China.
A variety of prescriptions of testing that target various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German recipe for the production of test tools sent to low-income countries without resources to develop themselves.
The German prescription was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, so it slowed the testing available in the U.S. At the beginning of the epidemic, China and the U.S. were troubled with the reliability of the test tools; the two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demand and recommendations of the test of health experts.
Instead, experts say that the availability of extensive testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The test capacity, mostly in the private sector labs, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the test program as the best way to slow down the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests waiting for launch in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of usap equipment as well as chemical reactors became impaired.
In March 2020, China accuracy issues on their test devices.
In the United States, the test tool developed by the CDC had a "defect"; the government then removed the bureaucracy barriers that prevent the testing by the private. Spain bought the test tool from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explains that incorrect results may be a result of failure to collect samples or use the test tool correctly.
The Spanish ministry said they would withdraw equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with other testing tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the testing tools purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results.
Atheş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test device purchased by Turkey from China had a "high level of error" and they didn't "use it".The UK bought 3.5 million test devices from China, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that the test device could not be used.
The test, followed by the quarantine of the positive person and the tracking of the person who was in contact with the positive SARS-CoV-2 person, gave a positive final result.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Voi, the place of the first deaths from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two trials on the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
Approximately half of the positively tested people have no symptoms, and all cases found are carantined.
With restrictions on the journey to this community, a new infection is completed.
With aggressive contact tracking, entrance travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore develops much slower than other developed countries although without extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore suggested residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools opened back in time after holidays on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics with aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantines, but with non-aggressive territory quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower case fatality, possibly because these countries were more able to detect people with mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following section, the column "% positive test results" is affected by the country's test policy.
The country that only tests people treated in the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors similar.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a hand cleaning action aimed at removing dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands consistently with soap at certain “critical times” throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or selesma, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous membrane).
Five critical moments throughout the day that are very important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after urination, after cleaning the child's ass or replacing the puppy, before swallowing the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or birds.
If there is no water and soap, the hands can be cleaned with ashes.The World Health Organization recommends washing the hands:
Before, when, and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment of the sick.
After replacing the clothes or cleaning the child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, cough, or swelling.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal dirt.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to clean the hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general society.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of flu, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce the mortality rate of the baby at home.
Studies conducted in 2013 showed that improved hands washing practices could slightly increase the high growth of infants.
In developing countries, the number of child mortality due to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce cases of diarrhea to about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as subconscious behavior carried out at home, school, and community around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of infant death; this disease causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause almost 3.5 million children’s deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet becomes an embedded habit can save more lives instead of vaccines or any medical action, as well as reduce deaths from diarrhea to almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation actions as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene program (WASH).
Hand washing also protects itself from impetigo that is transmitted through physical contact directly.
The small side effects of handwashing are the frequent handwashing that can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive washing of hands could cause skin swelling and scratching, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among health workers.
Too often washing hands is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease fecal-oral, i.e. before and after the use of the toilet (urine, urination), after the cleaning of the child’s ass (changing the puppy), before swallowing the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing meat, fish, or raw birds.
Another important time to apply the right handwashing technique to prevent the transmission of the disease is before and after the treatment of the wound; after swallowing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal wastes or treating animals; and after touching wastes.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% households practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest levels with 97 percent; the United States almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest levels with 23 percent. Now there are some behavioral change methodologies available to improve the adoption of behavioral habits of handwashing with soap at critical times.
The Basic Health Care Programme applied by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate scale action to support the health and education of children.
The administration of worm drugs twice a year, along with the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily brushing of teeth with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program was also implemented in Indonesia.
The cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soap or detergents to the water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser due to fat and protein, which is a component of organic dirt, is not easily soluble in water.
In this way, the cleaning of fat and protein is helped by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, due to its re-use properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that studied the bacterial transplantation from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transplantation was unlikely because the bacteria were melted with butter.
Nevertheless, the CDC continues to say “the liquid soap that is extracted from the container without touching the hand is preferred.”
Antibacterial soap is encouraged extensively to health-conscious communities.
Until now, there is no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptic or disinfectant is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant organism strains.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soap, this soap may not be as effective as it is marketed.
In addition to surfacts and skin protectors, advanced formulations can contain acids (acetate acid, askorbatic acid, lactate acid) as a pH regulator, benzoate acid as an active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioners (crocodile languages, vitamins, mentols, plant extract).A comprehensive analysis from the Faculty of Public Health of the University of Oregon shows that common soap is equally effective as consumer-level antibacterial soap that contains triclosan in preventing diseases and cleansing bacteria from the hands.
Comfortable hot water to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at a body temperature (37 °C).
Soaped hot water is more effective compared to soaped cold water in removing natural oils that resist dirt and bacteria.
However, backward with the belief of many people, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitation or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents, such as non-water-based alcohol sprayers (alcohol-based hand sprayers, antiseptic hand sprayers, or hand sanitation) began to be known.
Most of these hygienic agents are based on alcohol isopropyl or ethanol that are formulated together with the detergent substances such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gel or joint humectan such as glycerin into liquid or butter to be easy to use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Additional hydrogen peroxide encer increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand purification containing at least 60-95% of alcohol is an effective bacterial killer.
Alcohol purification kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungus.
Alcohol purification containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (reduction of log 3.5, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of log 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitation is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus type (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptic or alcohol spray in sufficient amounts should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and rear parts of the two hands, as well as the sides and ends of all the fingers are washed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, butter, or gel is dried.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing rather than handwashing, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increased use of sanitary agents due to the ease of use and rapid murder activity against microorganisms; however, sanitary agents should not be used as a proper handwash replacement, unless soap and water are not available.
Use of alcohol-based hand cleansing can often cause dry skin, unless emolien and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolien to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitation containing emolien causes irritation and drying of the skin much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in the alcohol handbushes are rare.
Lower tendency causes disruptive contact dermatitis to become the attraction of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean the hands from organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand cleansers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still in hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitation depends largely on the substance and its formulation, and according to history, this product has significantly performed worse than alcohol and alcohol spray.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Soil or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One of the worries is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The right handwashing techniques based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Center for the prevention of disease transmission include the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
The flowing water is recommended because the injected bascoma may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be influential.
Wrap your hands by wraping it with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, on your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands smoothly when using soap than when using water alone.
Drink for at least 20 seconds.
Drying creates shrinking, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and throwing longer removes more bacteria.
Wash smoothly under the flowing water.
Washing in the bascoma can make the hands contaminated again.
Dry with a dry leaf or let it dry in the air.
The wet and wet hands are more easily reinfected. The areas that are often delayed are the thumbs, nails, the areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and scratched nails can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep the hands not dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing when wheat water and/or soap are not available, for example, flowing water from jerogen or bottles hanged and boiled and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
Keran tippy is a simple technology that uses a bottle of water hanged with a thread, a stick that is operated by the feet to throw a little water into the hand, and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a debate about the most effective forms of hand drying in the public toilet.
More and more research shows that the paper sheet is far cleaner than the electric hand dryer found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper leaf industry, to compare the level of hygiene of paper leaf, hot air hand dryer, and more modern jet air hand dryer.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the fingers and 254% in the hands.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an increase in the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% in the fingers and 15% in the handbags.
After washing and drying hands with paper sheets, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the fingers and 77% in the hands.The scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential of cross-contamination in other toilet users and toilet environments due to each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which emits air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to explode microorganisms from the hands and units and is potentially polluting other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryers manufactured, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper sheets.
Washing hands with hand cleansing tissue is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitation should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection decreased with the use of the device.
Medical handwashing is done for at least 15 seconds, using soap and water in a lot or gel to swallow and scratch each part of the hand.
The hands should be stretched with the fingers linked to each other.
If there is dirt under the nails, the hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since the bacteria can persist in the water in the hand, the hands should be smoothly diluted and dried with a clean lap.
After drying, the paper sheet is used to kill the water curtain (and open the outdoor if necessary).
This action avoids hand contamination from the surface.
The purpose of handwashing in health care arrangements is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing remains at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash hands before touching the patient so that it transmittes microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the standards of handwashing and handwashing in the healthcare sector.
The WHO’s hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be seen on its website for public comments.
The relevant review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Hours” to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
prior to aseptic tasks, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "medicine" or "antimicrobial") works to kill the hand washing material.
Such murderous functions may be desirable before surgery or in situations where an antibiotic-resistant organism is very common. To 'smell' hands before surgery, it is necessary a flame that can be burned and turned off without touch, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile plate to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to smell as well as other sterile instruments to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be released.
This procedure requires washing the hands and lower arms to the edge, usually for 2–6 minutes.
Long washing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When washing, water on the lower arm should be prevented so that it does not flow back to the hand.
After completing the washing of the hands, the hands are dried with sterile clothes and the surgical clothes are worn.
To reduce the spread of bacteria, it is better to wash hands or use hand sanitation before and after treating the sick person.
For the control of staphylococcus infection at the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleansing comes from the first 20% washing, and that the additional benefits obtained very little when the hand cleansing frequency increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between washing hands with alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of each 30 seconds indicates that alcohol-based hand washers reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handbags to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the spora Clostridium difficile from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care arrangements can involve education for staff about washing hands, improving the availability of alcohol-based handbags, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in a variety of health care practices.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a basic cost-effective way to good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents, schools, and workplaces make the goal of achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, handwashes near private toilet or public toilet are rarely available, although there is an option to make cheap handwashes.
Anyway, the low level of handwashing can also occur due to the habits that have been embedded and not due to the lack of soap or water.
Incentives and incentives for handwashing with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in a long-term population behavior change.
In order to operate effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encouraged schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is achieved, the school can move from one star to the end to three stars.
Building a handwashing place can be part of a handwashing campaign that is carried out to reduce diseases and deaths of children.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaigns that try to the goal of behavioral change. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of handwashing emoji.
Some studies have studied the effectiveness of the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries in connection with the prevention of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year lost as a result of the disease.
One review shows that encouraging handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable conditions, such as a newborn mother or wounded soldier at the hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern care" in the UK.
At that time, many people still believe that the infection is caused by a bad smell called myasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the epidemic transmitted through food and health care-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raise awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, the poster "the right handwashing technique" is hanged next to the handwashing wastafel in the public toilet as well as in the toilet of the office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing hands from” means expressing a person’s refusal to be responsible for something or engage in something.
The expression comes from the Bible paragraph in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but has become a broadly used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to constantly wash her hands to clean imaginary spots; actions that show her guilt for the crime she did and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or considering unethical actions, people tend to wash hands more often and tend to more appreciate handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, the person who is allowed to wash the hands after such pollution has less capacity to engage in compensatory actions that “clean”, such as becoming a volunteer.
Religion orders handwashing for purposes of hygiene and symbolic. Symbolic handwashing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is part of the handwashing ritual in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Jewish, Lavabo in Christian, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also orders handwashing for hygiene, especially after certain actions.
The Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religions require handwashing after using the toilet.
In addition, the Hindu, Buddhist, Sikhist, Jewish, and Islamist religions require handwashing before and after a meal.
Workplace Dangerous Control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the implementation of the work safety and health methodology for hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk management at work depends on the workplace and job tasks, based on the risk assessment of the exposure source, the severity of the disease in society, and the risk factor of each employee that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Labour Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal employment contacts with the public and other colleagues; for this job, basic infection prevention measures, which include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and carry out cleaning and disinfecting the work environment on a regular basis.
Exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require close or frequent contact with an unknown or expected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in the ongoing community or international travel.
These groups include workers who have contacts with the general community such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail settings.
Dangerous controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air scanning, a spray protection, and providing self-protection tools when encountered with COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and body rooms exposed to a person known or expected to suffer COVID-19 high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs aerosol producer procedure on, or takes or deals with a sample of, a person known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
The adequate danger control for this employee includes technical controls, such as negative pressure ventilation spaces, and self-protection tools that correspond to work tasks.
COVID-19 may have some effects on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, whether in terms of the type of goods requested or the way of obtaining these goods (such as shopping outside busy hours, through delivery, or on-line).
Finally, the delivery of goods from the highly affected geographical territory of COVID-19 can be interrupted. Preparation and plan for infection disease can be used to guide protective measures.
The plan takes into consideration the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks of work, including the sources of exposure, the risk factors arising from home and community settlements, as well as the risk factors of each employee, such as age or chronic medical condition.
The plan also describes the controls necessary to cope with such risks and an emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Preparation and plan for the removal of infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of epidemic delay include reducing the transmission between staff, protecting people with a higher risk of bad health complications,ining business operations, and minimizing the negative effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is affected by the retaliation action taken.
Dangerous control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in safety and health at work to group dangerous controls based on their effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative distribution, and last self-protection tools.
Technical control involves isolating employees from work-related dangers without depending on the employee’s behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to apply.
Administrative control is a change in employment policies or procedures that requires the action of the employee or employer.
Self-protection tools (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected on the basis of danger on the worker, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirator), consistently and correctly applied, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and properly stored or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal employment contacts with the public and other employees.
Basic infection prevention measures are recommended for all workplaces including frequently washing hands properly, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include covering cough and sprinks, providing networks and waste containers, preparing work from a distance or work turn with time of arrival/return gradually, if necessary, informing employees not to use other people’s tools and equipment, and carrying out cleaning and disinfection of the work environment on a regular basis.
Fast identification and isolation of potentially transmitting individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever remedies or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that the vacation policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay at home to treat the sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, exposure-risk jobs are currently involving jobs that require close or frequent contact in a distance of six feet (1,8 meters) with an unknown or expected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the business location, or because a new person is on international travel to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes employees who have contacts with the general community such as in schools, work environments with high density of population, and high volume retail settings. Technical control for this group and high-risk groups include installing non-essential air filters to the high-efficiency location, improving the ventilation level, installing physical barriers such as plastic wire guard, and installing drive-thru or landature windows for customer service. Administrative control for this group and high-risk groups includes encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work rounds with gradual arrival/return time, discontinuing non-essential travel to the high-efficiency location, improving the level of ventilation, developing emergency communication plans to respond to the worker's safety forums, improving the worker's self-training and other worker's self-training factors about the face or high-risk groups include encouraging the worker's or combination of
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person is sick on the aircraft, the proper control to protect the employees and other passengers includes separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, indicating a cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking him to close his mouth and nose with tissue when he is coughing or swallowing.
Your cabin should wear medical gloves once-used when treating sick passengers or touching body fluids or surface that are potentially contaminated and other self-protection devices if the sick passengers experience fever, constant cough, or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other one-use items should be thrown into life-threatening pockets, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and infected afterwards. For commercial ships, including cruise vessels and other passenger vessels, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, isolating, and informing the medical center on the vessels immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on the vessels.
Despite the spread in the community, for schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in society at a minimum to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: cancellation of field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, vocal classes, or eating in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between the tables, time of arrival and gradual return, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in the local community, in addition to social restriction strategies, extension of school closure can be considered. For law enforcement officers who carry out daily routine activities, the direct health risk is considered low by the CDC.
The law enforcement officers who have to make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 persons are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection tools.
If close contact occurs during the arrest, the employee must clean and disinfect the tanks and task equipment before re-use using a spray or household cleaning sheet and follow the standard operating procedures to control and remove the container APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers that health and body rooms are in a high or very high risk category.
High exposure risk jobs include the provision of health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation power exposed to patients known or expected COVID-19.
This work becomes a very high risk of exposure if the employee performs aerosol producer procedures on, or takes or deals with, patients known or expected COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several procedures and dental examinations, or the taking of invasive samples.
High-risk body room work includes employees involved in preparing the bodies of a person known or suspected COVID-19 case at the time of death; this work becomes extremely high exposure risk if the employee carries out autopsy. Additional technical controls for this risk group include isolation space for patients known or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol producer procedure is carried out.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be suitable in some health care settings and body rooms.
The sample should be treated with preventive measures of Biological Safety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19.In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends a respirator for people who work within a distance of 6 feet from patients who are known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol producer procedures.
In the United States, the NIOSH-approved N95 or better face-covered respiratory filters should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes adequacy testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirator can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend completely covered clothes or coverall because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at the entrance point.
For people taking breathing samples, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, clothes, and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with the respirator N95 or FFP2.
Given that the supply of APD is not sufficient around the world, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical limitations such as a window-through sight, with only people involved in direct treatment can enter the room containing COVID-19, using only the APD required for a particular task, continuing to use the same respirator without releasing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of APD, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human bond and responsibility we have to each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care that we have witnessed among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is an incredible validation of the presence of extraordinary humans, whom we are lucky enough, to work with them.
My infinite gratitude and pride can call you all as a collaborator.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how meaningful it is for today’s world to have access to Wikipedia and how this is a strong symbol for these important resources to remain available online to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site remains running, help pay our colleagues, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially nowadays.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adaptation to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team-c met yesterday to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to maintain the organization’s survival throughout this time.
We strongly want to get rid of the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, it’s okay.
For all employees, contractors, and contractual employees:
Our daily work expectation is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notification.
We do not set holidays, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to take care of loved ones, shop for trees, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
This should not be said, but we say it.
Disease leave or PTO is not required, just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to ensure the key fields of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Members whose wages are based on hours will be paid full.
We have said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to colleagues contractors and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours when the conditions are normal.
This includes if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to transmit stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in such times.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to be expected and can take the appropriate action.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to go on.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, as well as the funding team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We will start the process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and turn our focus to support the things that are essential for our mission.
There’s a lot to do for us all, we’ll just focus fully on the most essential projects.
Delaying the present will not be anything for the future.
We don’t plan to “work the slurry in pursuit of missing” after this pandemic passed.
You will not be expected to work hard to meet the unrealistic momentum.
We realize that the situation changes and will be able to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the App (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to the new statements and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adapt the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make budgets so that employees can prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with less schedules for the next few weeks.
The extension of this timeline significantly reduces the current workload and planning pressure throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposals to the Council next week and will update the delegations and teams on the next step as soon as we get the confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, due to great concerns, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to infect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use a hospital-level antivirus fluid to infect every surface, lobby, and all lifts that reach our floor.
The building applies its own safety assurance protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel happy that the office will be ready to be used when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full-remote work station, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we are also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
The discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work from a distance for the first time.
Our colleagues who have long worked on a distance realize that it may need adjustments and they want to give you advice:
Limit the duration of the meeting for a maximum of one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Defining the meeting clearly, make a agenda, and send the reading material before.
Make the video a default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Show a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting record (or do a collaborative record).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small food.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared jobs
SDM Operating Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support improved jobs distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we asked all the recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO said the pandemic has ended.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete approved subsidy activities and that no one will be dismissed for having to delay or modify such objectives.
The next week we will continue with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the feelings of the entire global community seem to be a sadness due to this disruption, but at the same time relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help ourselves.
Meanwhile, you can continue to obtain information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, event, main workflow, or difficulties about coverage, or anything else that may require help, don’t hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and become connectors according to the need.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Global Operations Director of SDM International.
No one of these changes is seen as the abandonment of our job and duty.
Instead, this change is a recognition that, right now, our work and duties may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are the steps we believe it is important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support of our movements, and provide the world of services that they trust.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important jobs that come in a few weeks and a few months to come.
We need you all to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work the best when needed.

The angiotensin modifier enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer cell surface (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has a contrary activity to the angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE), reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has the M2 terminal-N peptidase domain and the renal amino acid collectrin terminal-C transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single type I release membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellal domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the soluble protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually secreted into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes mainly type II lungs alveolar cells, small intestinal enterosites, arterial and vein endothelial cells, and arterial pulmonary muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cortex of the brain, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brains.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE divides the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstriction angiotensin II.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the traffic of the transporter membrane of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into the cells for several coronavirus, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 protein on the spike or tune of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endositosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes located within the cell.
The process of entry of this virus also requires the priming of S protein by TMPRSS2 inhaled protease, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesized that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many community professionals and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitors therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that “the use of ACE inhibitors resulted in a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control.”
Moreover, the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia in patients with a higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the result is less strong than the risk of overall pneumonia.”
ACE2 human recombination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lungs injury, and appears to increase the hemodynamic lungs and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory disorders syndrome triggered by lipoplysacharides.
Half-time rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute work period in addition to the length of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for patients with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in the disease with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software app designed to help contact tracking to respond to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, a process of identifying people ("contact") who may have been in contact with the infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which get official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questioned, related to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the user of the application.
An alternative that is not too disturbing privacy includes the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread an application that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. in Singapore, the app is called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be submitted to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to people who are potentially infected and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The application is developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app will still wait for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in an advanced stage of development and will be available for dissemination within a few weeks. similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for diagnosed COVID-19 patients living in Moscow; the application is designed to ensure that they don’t leave the home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positive and the possibility of lack of effectiveness if the data taken by the application is limited to a small portion of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple has set a limit on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, i.e. limiting only to the “official” or well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon applied similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organization sets out eight conditions for the government’s project:
the surveillance must be "in accordance with the law, necessary, and proportionate";
extension of monitoring and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
any data sharing with third parties must be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all the "relevant interests" are required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders) (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanisms from the device’s operating system after no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based locations tracking, and not applications, thus eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have potential significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, unapplication-based systems are used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications through text messages to persons potentially infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the information of the location available to the public, which is permitted with the extensive change in the information privacy law after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries like Germany consider using a centralized system at the same time a system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not been published.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is a well-established concept, with a large number of research literature starting at least in 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts work on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user’s proximity with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Near Tracking that Protect Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Interim Contact Number (TCN, previously referred to as Contact Incident Number, CEN), Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), etc.
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all evacuation occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar work was SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and originally also founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without damaging the privacy of such data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have a fundamentally identical approach and is a numerous protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is the key aspect of achieving broad acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it has created the BlueTrace protocol used by its government’s official application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim to protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
the launch of the tool to enable the government to create an official coronavirus tracking application that protects privacy
The integration of this feature directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to solve the problem of data collection and continuous surveillance with initially distributing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat passed.
The drug response (also known as giving a new purpose, a new profile, or a new task to a drug or a therapeutic transition) is the use of a drug that has been approved for a new treatment purpose, i.e. for a disease or medical condition that is different from the initial purpose of the drug development.
This path is a path of scientific research that is currently underway to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be the target of the drug, each protein has several ligan bonding sites.
Analysis of these ligan bonding sites can be the basis of an effective anti-virus drug development project against the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important target SARS-CoV-2 proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerase, heliase, S protein, and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A, et al studied a number of candidate compounds that were later optimized and analyzed the similarity of the cornea with the drug that has been approved and has the highest similarity to accelerate the development of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potato drugs in its practical studies to be recommended in the design of the clinical study.
Chlorokuin is an anti-malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the test of chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin in New York will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochlorokuin sulfate and chlorokuin phosphate based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized based on EUA only as a experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxyclorokuin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" was not specified.
The doctors said they used the drug when “there is no other choice.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokuin combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
The major studies are ongoing at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test of safety and continuity of preventive use of hydroxyclorokuin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was proven "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were tested negative in an average of four days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not take the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Agency reminded the public that the evidence available to support the drug is not much and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it will buy the drug from Japan for supply and use military to send the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

This drug may not be safe if used by pregnant mothers or people trying to get pregnant.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirus lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “there is no observed benefit.”
The drug is designed to prevent the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will be associated with the SARS-CoV-2.There is a criticism in the scientific community about the guidance of resources to reposition the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had an antivirus activity in vitro against several filo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
One problem with antivirus treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can cause disease and more severe transmission.
There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials carried out by the University Hospital of Cleveland, one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intraveneous vitamin C for people treated in a residential and severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled plasebo (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York starts the test for the antibiotic Azitromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, a corticosteroid inhalation for asthma, for the treatment of new pre-symptomatic coronavirus infection patients.

Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchisine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms so they did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients so encourages the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centered study of 300 patients who studied the use of sodium enoksaparin in the preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment targets to approved and developed antiviral drugs for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition
Umifenovir: Umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition
Some identified antibiotics are potentially a drug that can be given a new target for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, the trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical trials, a lot of efforts are being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to the WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the caused virus of the disease, will not be available within less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Large vaccines will spread around the world by 2020, resulting in huge investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the published genome to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that what should be observed in the development of vaccines is the speed, production capacity, spread at the required scale, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI officials that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development in early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that advanced to Phase I security studies, include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developers of Phase I and vaccine candidates: Modern, mRNA-1273)
virus vectors (developers of Phase I and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vectors type 5)
As by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered being in planning or being planned).
Phase I-II tests perform early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomly, placebo-controlled, and in some locations, while determining the more accurate effective dose.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring the side effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates being developed (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them are not in human evaluation (there are still in "praklinic" studies).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they are investigating the potential of a molecular inhibitor vaccine that will genetically modify viral protein to stimulate immune reaction.

On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they will get the results of the pre-clinical trials in April 2020 and vaccine candidates in the final stage can begin to be tested on humans in the autumn.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemial Preparation Innovation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Win, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with the total CEPI investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reached $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six candidates for vaccines on animals.
Researchers from the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing an RNA vaccine that can self-amplify for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days after receiving a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical retaliation research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and Saskatchewan University initiative.
Almost at the same time, the Canadian government announced a fund of $192 million dedicated to the development of the vaccine COVID-19, with plans to establish a national “vaccin bank” containing a number of new vaccines that can be used if another coronavirus epidemic occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Faculty of Medicine PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, test on mice; they stated that “the MNA that gives the subunity S1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine causes an antigen-specific antibody response [on mice] that begins to be visible 2 weeks after vaccination.”
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the DNA-based vaccine candidate design as a potential nasal spray.
By using bacteriophagus, DNA is designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless viral-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities will gather resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
This means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A further tracking trial in Australia sought to follow 4,170 health officers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early studies to evaluate the prevalence of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, showed the need for protective measures to reach biological safety level 3 in dealing with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, no drug or vaccine for SARS is proven safe and effective in humans.
According to the research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS studies are believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines are in process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two vector adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
In social media posts, the conspiracy theory that claims that the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that the vaccine has been available.
Patents quoted by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequence and vaccines for other coronavirus gallurs, such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by the coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing discomfort.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of absorption, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the start of the symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and failure of the spinal organs.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed.This virus mainly spreads among humans when it occurs in close contact, often through a bit or small droplets produced through cough, swelling, or when speaking.
Although produced during breathing, droplet usually falls to the ground or to the surface and is not infectious to a distance.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the symptoms occur, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the subsequent stage of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is with a real-time re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharyngitis.
The use of the mask is recommended for people suspected to be infected with the virus and the person who treats it.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public are different; some authorities recommend not using masks, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have symptoms or have symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing failure.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or swelling in the ongoing chest, confusion, difficulty awakening, and face or lips bleeding; immediate medical discontinuation is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Symptoms of upper breathing, such as swelling, swelling, or throat pain can be found, but more rarely.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with a clinical picture of chest scratch and palpitation.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of the spinal organs, and death.
This time is called inkubation.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. reports show that not all people infected have symptoms.
The role of these non-symptomatic carriers in the transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the percentage of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and is under investigation, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) report that 20% of all confirmed cases remain without symptoms during treatment in the hospital.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of the test.
Sputum and slurry can carry viral load on a large scale.
Speaking loudly releases more scratches or droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough could cause droplets to be pushed up to a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although these viruses are usually not transmitted through the air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences shows that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in the corridor outside the room of people produce positive samples for the virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make the respiratory secretions transform into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most infectious when people are signs; although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on carton/cardus, up to three days on plastic (polipropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products dissolve the anti-virus fat layer, deactivate the virus, as well as release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (chirurgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, a sample of saliva was taken in median two days after the hospital treatment began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day of the test.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the cluster of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the new characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus exist on coronavirus associated in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which damages its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is close to the first SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the living cells through the angiotensin 2-modifier enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the alveolar cells type II of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spike or tune" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the living cells.
Acute heart injury was found in 12% of infected people who were treated in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe diseases.
The level of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and disorders of the immune system during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injuries may also be associated with the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High incidents of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsy in people who died because of COVID-19 found diffus alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, T cells that extract pathogenic GM-CSF have been shown to be correlated with the recruitment of monocytes that extract inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathologies in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphostic infiltrates have also been in the autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is a real-time re-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on breathing samples obtained through nasopharing usps; however, nasal usps or sputum samples can also be used.
In general, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken at a two-week distance so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus galur and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop a polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) independently to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies (which can detect an active infection and if a person has previously been infected) are in development, but not much used.
Chinese experience with the test shows its accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Zhongnan University Hospital of Wuhan suggests methods to detect infection based on clinical images and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution is widely found at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (lobular septum thickness with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can appear with the development of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on otopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurism, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia virus severity can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumosite hyperplasia, large atypical pneumosite, interstitial inflammation with lymphosite infiltration, and the formation of many giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: diffus alveolar damage (DAD) with diffus alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disorders syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or swallowing and recommends the use of the inner part of the wrist if the tissue is not available.
Suitable hand hygiene after cough or swelling is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of facial covering of clothes in public places, partially to limit the transmission by people without symptoms. The social restriction strategy aims to reduce the contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
The limitation guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
Since the vaccination is expected not to exist until the beginning of 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is attempting to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the "riding curve".
CDC also recommends that people frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after swallowing their nose, cough, or swallowing.
Moreover, the CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitation that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitation is not available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antiseptics".
Glycerol is added as humectan.
People are treated with support treatment, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends people who suspect they carry the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extrakorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Self hygiene and lifestyle as well as a healthy diet is recommended to improve immunity.
Supporting treatment may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with COVID-19 patients treated in the home.
Intense therapists and lungists in the U.S. have prepared treatment recommendations from various institutions into a free resource, IBCC.
By April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical forces more recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) than ibuprofen for first line use.
Preventive measures should be taken in order to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care arrangements when performing procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health care providers who treat COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the tuberculosis-air infection isolation space (AIIR) in addition to using standard preventive measures, contact preventive measures, and tuberculosis-air preventive measures.
The recommended equipment is: APD clothes, respirator or face mask, eye protector, and medical gloves. If available, the respirator (not face mask) is better.
The N95 respirator has been approved for industry regulations, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The N95 respirator is designed to protect from air-inherent particles such as dust, but the effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face protector or, as a last attempt, a home-made mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too heavy to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are very heavy.
The type of respiratory support for people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is being actively studied for people treated in the home, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal canal or bipositive air vessel pressure.
It is unclear whether either of these two methods produces the same benefits for people with critical illness.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, as this technique restricts the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal canules. Heavy cases occur more often in lansia (persons over the age of 60 and especially people over the age of 80).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which restricts the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden rise of the number of COVID-19 cases that are quite severe so that it requires hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive treatment units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized eventually entered the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators capable of performing high pressure and PEEP control mode are required to maximize the supply of oxygen while at the same time minimizing the risk of lung injury and pneumotoraks associated with the ventilator.
High PEEPs may not be available on the old ventilator.
Research on the potential treatment begins in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take time until 2021, some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already under further testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO recommended volunteers participate in the testing of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for plasma convergence as a experimental treatment in the case of a person’s life is very or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the necessary clinical trials to prove its safety and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the epidemic of the disease.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'nate contacts' using surveillance data so that it can detect the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends independent quarantine, but also informs the local health officials. Data analysis on mobile data, face identification technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track the infected people and the people who interact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security bodies to track the cellular data of persons allegedly infected with coronavirus.
The measure is taken to impose a quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
Moreover, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom will share a set of telephone location data to the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses face identification technology to detect quarantine breachers.
Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told mobile operators that “40% of citizens are still moving.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor who said, "Augmented social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic deterioration are the perfect storm that damages mental health and public well-being."
This disease can be mild with little or without symptoms, which resembles other general upper respiratory diseases, such as colds.
Light cases usually heal within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less.
In the most severe people affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or failure of the spinal organs.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clot, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood accumulation disorders, especially an increased protrombin time, were observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized, while kidney disorders were observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with the image COVID-19 showed an increase in the liver enzyme (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the awakening of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in home treatment.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average seven-day time between hospitalization and death.
In a study that studied early cases, the median time from the early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Postmortem pulmonary samples have shown diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromicsoid exudate in both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus are observed in pneumosites.
The pulmonary image is similar to the acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of deaths by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed, with an increase in troponin levels or heart stop.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of the people treated in the residence have a native condition. The availability of medical and social-economic resources of a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality of the conditions vary due to the differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A lack of light counting of cases can cause the number of deaths to be counted too high.
However, the fact that deaths were a result of cases that occurred in the past may mean that the current mortality figure is counted too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The authorities of the Hong Kong Hospital found a decrease in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung screening indicated organ damage.
This can also cause post-healing-intensive syndrome after healing.
Until March 2020, it is unknown if the previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity to people healed from this disease.
Immunity may be obtained, if observed other coronavirus behaviors, but there has been cases of COVID-19 healing followed by a coronavirus positive test a few days later.
This case is believed to be an aggravated remaining infection, not a reinfection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and comes from animals, through a spreading infection.
The origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection is almost entirely driven by the transmission from humans to humans.
A study of 41 first confirmed COVID-19 cases, which was published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of symptoms occurring was 1 December 2019.
The official publication of the WHO the earliest signs of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time, as well as influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time since the first epidemic, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO set the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to the statistics of the Johns Hopkins University, the mortality rate for cases globally was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) by 17 April 2020.
Other measurements include the case mortality figure (CFR), which reflects the percentage of the diagnosed people who died from a certain disease, and the infection mortality figure (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a certain disease.
These statistics are not timely bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all people infected make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and the possibility that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Moreover, the German health system is not overcome.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0,004% of the population) were affected to death due to COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and its mortality rates are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the risk difference between new men and women not appear at the age of 90.
In China, the number of deaths for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The certain reason for these gender-based differences is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have complicated conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected are men and 72% of the people who died due to COVID-19 are men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government will not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female sex healthcare workers is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is an abbreviation for corona, VI for viruses, D for diseases, and 19 for the time the epidemic was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or a group of people, in accordance with the international recommendations for nominations aimed at preventing stigmatisation. The virus that caused COVID-19 was named coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 responsible virus” in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease are commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory diseases 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that encourage not to use location names in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 will be released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitation of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal usap and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital has a great need for a carpenter, and the supplier can’t provide in the required time scale, a local company recovered and printed the 100 carpets needed in the night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19, the theory of conspiracy, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
People seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the replication of the virus on pigs, cows, and chickens.
There are no medications or vaccines approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a “SOLIDARITY Trial” to study the effects of the treatment of four existing antivirus compounds with the most promising progress.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccine strategies being studied.
First, the researchers aim to make a complete viral vaccine.
The use of these viruses, whether inactive or dead viruses, aims to quickly trigger the human body’s immune response to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunity vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to a particular subunity of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus interfere with the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccines).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to know its safety and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine begins with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains unharmful genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Increased dependency on antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials that are ongoing in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxyclorokuin or chlorokuin.
New targeted antivirus drugs formed the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting time limit at the end of April.
By April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs is already available.Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychlorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there are temporary evidence of remdesivir advancement.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chlorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with initial results.
However, there is an appeal for a subsequent review of the investigation.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that a double dose is very dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxyclorokuin and chlorokuin on the policy of doctors treating COVID-19.China's 7th edition also contained interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Early data show that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanids have been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 slowdown in low concentrations.Studies show that early priming of tonic protein by transmembranate protease 2 serin (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies on chlorokuin and hydroxyclorokuin with or without azithromycin have a large limit that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The complications of the cytokine storm can occur at the COVID-19 weight stage.
There is evidence that hydroxyclorokuin may have anti-sicotine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the guidelines of treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
The drug is undergoing non-tracking phase 2 tests at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum feritin blood test to identify the cytokine storm, the drug is intended to fight the cytokine storm, which is supposed to be the cause of death in some people affected.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA on the basis of a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid cytokine refractor release syndrome triggered by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
Until now, there is no random and controlled evidence that suggests that tocilizumab is a substantial treatment for CRS.
The transfer of cleansed and attached antibodies produced by the system of people who have been healed from COVID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a method of passive non-vaccin immunization.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the working mechanism expected for passive antibodies therapy that can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depends on antibodies and/or fagositosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, for example, using produced monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of the convalescent serum, which forms a liquid part of the healed patient’s blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, can be enhanced for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, who was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
