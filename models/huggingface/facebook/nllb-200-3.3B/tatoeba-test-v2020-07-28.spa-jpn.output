Tom no car.
Looking back, I realize how much time I've wasted in my life.
Tom won't admit it, but he's in big trouble.
Let's get started.
I've never used an axe before.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom found a hundred dollar bill on the street.

Look at that kid running.
     
️️️️️️
He's sick. He's not well.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️

Tom likes to push the boundaries.

I think you should take a break; you look sick.
I lent him a CD.
️ I've been there many times.
The nurse gave me a shot.
