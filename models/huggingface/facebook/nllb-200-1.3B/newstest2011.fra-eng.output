CSSD doesn't know Voldemort or any bakery in Prague.
The new CSSD members of the city council of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues from the SDG.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the CSSD municipal council, whether they know the argument that has arisen in the last few years in the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who ruled in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the metropolis' personalities, situations, and causes.
It was surprisingly discovered that the newly elected members did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I am a novice in Prague politics", said Lukas Kaucky, the culture candidate who took the 'godfather' vocabulary test.
And as for the veteran politician, Karel Brezina, the elected official, he reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only phrase you've suggested I use".
Otherwise, I don't use the slang.
From the vocabulary, which the daily Aktualne.cz published in June this year before the pre-election congress of the SDG, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "going to the pastry shop", "beef nerf", "betrayal of the capital" and "spoiling".
Three of the candidates agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth-choice Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
"I don't care about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I won't give my opinion".
"I am currently working on how we will understand each other in our programmes", he said.
As we've heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Ka'ucky and the only phrase he guessed in the test was "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel", Kaucky says, and immediately adds, "But I know it from the papers".
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course", he joked.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmentalist, know that the golf hole is Blanko's tunnel.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to the bakery".
"It is, I think, to go to a company", Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of the companies of Janousek.
Brezina also points out that he draws his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he might use.
According to the test takers, there is no such thing as a lexicon of arguments in social democracy.
"I've consulted with colleagues and it turns out we really don't have anything like that".
"We are rather saying names sometimes using abbreviations and symbols", says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my coworkers call me that", admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is a Papy for the Party members or the less friendly Little old, Representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention to him before the elections by scams during the party sponsoring, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The only names the Social Democrats admit to using within the party are nicknames.
It is said that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in batting law" recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate in law from the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the older generation, unable to work for example because of health reasons, single and childless.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so she doesn't threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this fate".
"Even healthy young women are not judged because they are involved in work and childbearing", says a sister who works in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution for more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He's published a pamphlet that should help limit the witch hunt.
There's a hit on the case.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are illiterate", warned the daily Die Standard about the disadvantage of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African lands.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman, died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with the oil they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals claim it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing caught fire upon the woman's contact.
The oil caught fire, it is said, when the team tried to "cast out the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all educational levels.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Human spirit-eaters have always been a danger".
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch hunt, Gambia as recently as last year even saw the President himself taking part.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a widespread witch hunt which, it is said, participated in his death and tried to kill the President as well through black magic".
"Shamans from neighbouring Guinea came to the rescue and, under the protection of police and the President's personal bodyguard, brought men and women from villages in the Gambia to the presidential farm in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm, prisoners were to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that had other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The stove is heating up, he signed a higher rent.
A stately old man walked out the door of the customer center of the RPG Byty company of "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter's, and his son's, who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has raised the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second-class apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there's no hot water and the heating runs on solid fuel", points to his son's new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway", he explains, angry and half-resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published explaining the method to follow to claim.
But the man responds to this with a gesture.
"One says this, the other says that", with a frown.
The Ostrava region is becoming the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic are like, where the rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 am.
Right next to the door is a security guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is turned on on the touchscreen.
One push and a piece of paper with a number on it comes out of the machine.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the roof of the waiting room.
In a split second, it's your turn.
After a short while,an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rent does not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
Most people came to deal with common problems like everywhere else - requests for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people from over 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special ticket office for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still being tested", the clerk at the counter replies after a moment's hesitation when the customer introduces himself as a journalist.
The demolition and former miners' apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local issue.
The Vice-President of the Parliament, Lubomir Zaoralek, from the Ostrava region of the Social Democrats, made a fairly strong statement about this before the elections and it is now in the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change a fucking board in the toilet", the man relieves in the introduction.
However, according to the employees, it is mainly pensioners who come to make sure that they will receive a rebate on the new rent price if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half the amount of rent that other tenants who sign their new lease before 15 December will receive.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed with questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent", says the clerk.
And yet RPG provides both on its website and in its showcases individual rent interviews when needed.
If the parties disagree on the rent, an independent court will decide.
'This is not about threats but just about the only legitimate way to act legally,' RPG says on its website.
"This person will not go to court", one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks and the man in the street in front of the customer centre agrees.
"I have 13,000 crowns of pension and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court", he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see about that".
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media is asking that nobody sign and so people are waiting", she says.
The rental regulation in the Czech Republic ends at the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund", says Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who points out that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments with rents 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen, however, hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered chairs in the Havirosvka Street waiting room, repeats some information in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments.'
"And it will still be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month", says the screen.
The 38 percent increase is only for 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is a really low increase of 19.66 CZK per m2", adds RPG.
Next year, the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the office, including the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it would also house a mini-kindergarten with everything you need - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees have been able to visit.
The architectural design firm Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has been designing its mini-enterprise kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employed about 90 people, mostly of childbearing age, and was concerned that women architects and project managers could return to work quickly.
Along with parttime employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to employees by Arch Design as part of its social programme.
This gives builders and architects the opportunity to combine demanding work with childcare.
Arch.Design employees themselves conceived the idea of this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-nursery school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme for human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
The financing grants (CZK 2.8 million) enabled them to buy equipment and equipment and after two years to provide qualified staff and start-up.
After the use of the funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The project took a year to prepare and the company Economy rating helped to apply for funding.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, with a nurse and a kindergarten teacher taking care of the children all day. Children can attend kindergarten without age limitation but are mostly over three years old.
As this is a "mini-kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at a time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of their hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the mini-nursery programme is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children do not only play there but there is also quality education - from the beginning to the preparation for school, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that the children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time and not have the stress of being late to pick up the children at a school far from the parents' workplace.
So parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty develops between employee and employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus among the companies that offer a preferential bonus for the recruitment of new employees and that are family-friendly and through this programme strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric sauropod, the stairs look like a dinosaur spine, and the balconies look like open fish mouths.
This is the case of the Casa Battlo in Barcelona, designed by architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its organic forms, the house has been nicknamed the Bone House by the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and everywhere curves, these are all typical of Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front of the house is unfolding its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind us of nature and animals.
On closer inspection, the geometry, rhythm and order are clearly thought out.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way as to enhance the impression of bright colors.
The winding and twisting of the forms also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood is used to make waves for window frames, balustrades, door decorations, eyelets, and slats.
The house Battlo, which stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy contractor, first insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-apartment house was not conceived by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely from his project that the decorations for a representative apartment of the building's owner and the use of mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and designers also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the plans for the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and the Park Guell in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the hot house right after it was finished because of its organic shapes, "the Bone House".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "the house that beats".
It is said that on top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí conceived a unique central heating system for the house, with typical ventilation and chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi did not follow the building directives of the time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the city council were not happy that the construction piers were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
No change was made, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city appealed, Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third a room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is divided by a staircase leading up to an independent roof terrace.
All the right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or else limit the private space for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received in addition to new facades an untraditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles decorating the courtyard and the lighthouses.
The two-color set gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
All we had to do was to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Battlo, which was inscribed in 2005 on the UNESCO World Heritage List, is a place that everyone can visit.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued to visit as they saw that it was a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and the attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance to the monument is really cheap, at 16.50 euros, and students, retirees, groups and tourist cardholders get 20 percent off.
The sum is still above the entrance price of the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a companion among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a pillow: women have different criteria than men.
No fancy frame, but rather the quality of the sleeping surface, so the mattress and the top make a real foundation for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
The choice is made on the basis of several factors: weight, height, age, health and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and pillow are to be placed is also important.
Typical example?
For example, in a country house where you don't sleep all the time, latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" slowly.
They are also heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to turn them frequently.
If they also lack ventilation channels at the core and are also on a solid board, they retain moisture and may also form mould.
Habit is also a factor in the choice.
If you spend a lot of time abroad, where you often use very thick mattresses with a soft covering, you will not feel comfortable on a low, hard surface.
"That's how every hockey player who comes back from the NHL complains they can't sleep there".
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder and thus do not take the 'information' of joints and skin well", explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why, a few years ago, the mattress with lazy foam won over the hockey players and other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses for example.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to your body's heat.
Nothing presses you, and you don't turn around in the middle of the night like you've been through a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against scratches.
To choose the mattress according to your height, add the length of the feet, which is about 21/34 cm.
So a man and a woman who are 180cm tall need a bed 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each of the two beds should be 90 cm, or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example single beds, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient for visitors.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent.' Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Mattress Hangers and Decorators, who has been working for several years on the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and who teaches this in special schools.
For a double bed each needs its own mattress and pillow, so be careful, however, when buying to choose the mattress height.
Otherwise, you will have to raise the top to different heights, and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be used for the form and aeration layer.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress, you should not feel the springs", warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of pillow.
The bed-supply, when the mattress and the bed-supply are joined like Siamese sisters, has no place in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were so badly rotted that they were not to be washed, as is common today.
And since during the night we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years the mattress begins to resemble a large (and stuffy) sieve.
For this reason, experts refuse to make claims about a 25-year life for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
But all in his own way.
For a mattress of 120/140cm, forgo hygiene or washing for the mattress covering, but add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And although nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper for the whole set, that is to say that after opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the handling for the large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
You have a hardboard in your bed instead of a bedspread?
I never will.
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night.
However, if there are no ventilation holes, equip the board and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with spring bags (Taschenfederken) and a ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position 14/18-slap mattresses, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (perhaps a combination of latex and coconut) are ideal, but it is always better for you to have a mattress with more slides, 28 and above, where the slides are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and so the rigidity can be regulated.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be taken as they do not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the lamellae, a shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special bonding of the lamellae that allows the lamella to be pressed or even bent so that the sleeper's shoulder "fits" well.
For men with "shoulders as wide as their backs", this is a big deal.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who have begun to use a softening area at the shoulder level for "men".
But they also think about women - they give them a softer surface at the hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are winged or platelet-shaped summers with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure is spread out over more points and the tension is diminished.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (big and inflated) on good mattresses and pillows, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50x60 cm which the Scandinavians prefer, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the pillow or the softened area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the earlier straw and herb mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
The petroleum-based raw materials used to make polyurethane are being replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The qualification Bio for mattresses means that the core is made from natural products", explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of birch plants for the mattress covering absorbs heat and cools the body, "cooling" the man, the covers "warming" the woman.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams produces polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You'll pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and above.
Those characterised by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex was the first.
Saving for mattress and bed is not easy.
Occasionally, special promotions by manufacturers or producers may offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, we can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the "cosmic" tempo of Tempur matter.
It started as a NASA subject because astronauts were undergoing massive load-flatters.
Tempered wood melts in the heat and hardens in the cold.
It therefore fits perfectly into the warm human body and distributes optimum pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal for sleeping and for increasing comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or similar foams.
The demand for devices to track people is growing among parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their children is leading more and more people to think about monitoring them through GPS.
The system, which was initially set up to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases, such as the case of the little girl Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved many people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disrupt their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy", says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of someone who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases".
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons", adds Pilin.
He said children should always know what the "box" is used for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if a child does not feel like wearing this type of thing, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest can be very creative when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be in control.'
"Mobile phones, which can cut themselves off like these tracking devices, have already caused parents to wait for long periods", says Bockova.
She said that the fact that this type of device could help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If it is a premeditated kidnapping, the perpetrator will make sure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him".
"Right now, it's the phone".
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (the criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in the case of unplanned abuse by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, a company that provides tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
'The apparatus may be set so that it is in regular emission after a specified period.'
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains".
'More expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately indicates the position of the person who slipped and is in a lying position without moving,' says Cech.
He said that so-called smart mobile phones, which are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with special prologue software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that they are either a device similar to those we wear in a matchbox-sized pendant or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the Macro Weil company, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential assailant will not be able to recognize the tracking device".
"Or he will find out after a while, which will give the police a little more time", he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendant, it would still use the same technology as it does to track cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning systems (commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the vehicle's current position.
The army has enough detonating ropes to go around the Czech Republic, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Just last year, the Department of Defense bought 224 kilometers of it.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the ropes is two to four years at most.
The army bought detonating ropes from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The reason given by the General Staff for the purchase of a huge quantity of detonating ropes from MF DNES is that the soldiers use 60 km of them per year.
According to the calculations of the reserves to be held by the pyrotechnicians of the army, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an annual exercise on explosives.
The Minister of Defence, Alexandre Vondra, and the Commander of the Armed Forces, Vlastimil Picek, are no exception.
Just to justify the army's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of detonating cord.
At this distance, there were 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the Army reserves could provide for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it were true that for the basic training of each new professional, more than 2 m of detonating ropes are sufficient, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet soldiers in the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't mind if they buy so many of our detonating ropes".
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing".
"For us the military is a good customer that we strive as traders to satisfy", says Jan Decky, commercial director of STV Group.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of detonating ropes is because the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports, however, that detonating ropes only last four years and police and military pyrotechnicians only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can go up to four years", says one of the two who does not want his name published in view of the criticism of the army.
The time limit of service life has passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a quantity discount for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km", said spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating ropes of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police still only order the amount of ammunition needed to be used before their life is over.
This was established for the safety of the pyrotechnicians and to enable more flexible use of more modern and reliable types of detonating cord.
The Ministry of Defence is now having a major problem in neutralizing tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 men was preparing to move towards the Rhine.
What awaits the Czech army in a few years' time, which MF DNES contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating ropes which it now buys "cheaply".
To this day, I benefit from the contacts I made through the competitions.
The franchising of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur contest for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His journey to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And while abroad, he realized that there was a shortage of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
With his savings from his earnings while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small five-unit apartment building that was half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year college student, it was a courageous move.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our area made me want to do something", says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profits in the building that he turned into a 54-bed boarding house.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has enabled him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year he had another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise have come forward", the number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license to operate a large-scale hotel, the winning of the Entrepreneur of the Year competition has served well", adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and being known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often complimented me, and I must say it was very pleasant", he recalls.
He encourages all those who are trying to do something to take part in this competition.
It's not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses to this day his contacts and knowledge which he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the competition I began to maintain regular business relations.
He said that the reputation linked to success had an impact on employees as well.
And he's got about 70.
"I see in them above all the loyalty and pride in having undertaken something that has been generally recognized".
"This is by far not the result of my personal work, but the result of a good work by all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward", says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's sense of purpose, Farmet has his worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky dum to claim the first place in the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky, the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury awarded him for his efforts in transforming a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the award has encouraged not only myself but also my colleagues and has increased our confidence in fighting the competition,' says the winner of last year's competition.
In the early days of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the Communists confiscated the property, he did not hesitate for long, turned down a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and set up a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after that they began to specialize in pressing vegetable oil.
After eighteen years it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company became known even among the non-specialist public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand, but also foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that had the greatest success in its home country", says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year was not just a year of victory for Farmet.
The company was assessed on the basis of the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for engineering machinery sales.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start to limit their purchases of new equipment and technology.
"We obviously have not escaped this situation".
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to reduce our production and even lay off workers", explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that sometimes unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation well and maintained profitable results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
"We have built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presentation at international trade fairs and won the main awards at national exhibitions", says Zdarsky.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
The turnover is up and with it the number of employees.
"I wish the new winner this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere", says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that takes away the rules of the game.
The absurdity of the year poll is now part of the business clan for the fourth time.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The unflattering winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the requirement to bring documents to offices that public servants can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social services requested a paper extract from the trade register, whereas the official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
That changes with the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the extract from the trade register for checks on insurance payments", said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
The aim of this year's absurdity contest is to highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organised by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters showed up, this year at least 4000 have cast their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only curb the enterprise, and,this, increasingly.
"We may be among the top-ranked tax returns in the world", says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for enterprise, 8 places higher than last year.
The absurdity of the year contest was first established in 2006 and continues every year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the contest closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes is declared the winner.
Until last year's survey, it was a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that had lost their meaning.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also by the trade unions and the teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, i.e. among the nominees, is the obligation that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with 20 employees refurbish two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always starts in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening that regularly attracts political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kuzel, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, attended the final stage of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state is putting donkeys in the legs of entrepreneurs and that is why my aim is to remove, every year, at least three dozen clauses which today only complicate business,' said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a fluke.
In 2007, what people didn't like was the requirement for contractors to declare three days in advance to the office for the individual business where the business is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This requirement was abolished with the amendment of the Private Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report a 30-day business trip for a foreign employee to the Labour Office, was abolished with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything's fine until the third session of the contest.
The absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physical therapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
That was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sporting projects are evaluated.
The new feature of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been running for five years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support fair and reasonable enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor their business' environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business", says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile phone operator Vodaphone, which sponsors and promotes the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this first year of this subcategory of the firm of the year 2010 competition, organised by Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company have entered.
The adventures of each of them are rich in inspiration and an independent article should be published.
Although the object of their undertaking is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns disabled persons and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is the Prague-based prologue company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of its employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for 17 years, which sponsors handicapped children.
The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70% of the workforce, was awarded the title of responsible firm for the Central Bohemian region and came third in the region in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the winner was MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which introduced flexible working hours and even reduced them to an average of 35 hours a week, without a proportionate decrease in wages.
The jury also awarded the prize to the company because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports local activity and cares about the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment", explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
The IT company Enlogit in the Usti Region also cares about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages them to work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadows Foundation which helps the local Roma community", says Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
The last company to be included in the list is a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standard.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, skills development and leisure", says Joseph Strapac of Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had completed the questionnaire attached to the registration document and sent it back to the organiser before 15 August, were automatically entered in the Responsible Company category.
The organisers withdrew from the competition the incorrect or incomplete answers to the questionnaire.
"If the representatives of the firms in competition had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the Competition of the Responsible Firm but were not disqualified from the main competition Vodaphone Firm of the Year".
"Independent entries are not possible as this is a subcategory of the main Firm of the Year competition", explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public tender
The anti-corruption police have been making arrests at the Land Fund building in Plzen in recent days.
Detectives have handcuffed local real estate developer G. Lubos.
The Commission has made every effort to correctly handle a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed land is obtained by a determined candidate.
The latter was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in a public tender and competition", said the head of the Plzen prosecutor's office, Antonie Zelena, who told Pravo newspaper that she was not allowed to provide further explanations as the investigation was ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
As to how he could influence a public tender, we can only speculate in view of the limited official information.
Pravo's spokeswoman Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a customer and not an employee", she said.
The public tender, according to Cerna, is called "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Law on Land" and is set up when several candidates are eligible.
'These persons are offering, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights of restitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced.'
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of acquirers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights", the Fund spokesman explained.
Lubos G. clearly had information on the persons who had signed up for the call and, being himself also a beneficiary, having purchased a large number of rights of return, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably was cashing in on his retirement.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts at the Land Fund well above the standards.
It was included in the case of the former head of the FdT, Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for having issued land for which a decision to set up a building had already been issued.
Lubos G. had, for example, acquired land for the construction of public transport links, specifically on the site where the access road to the Borske Pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the city council for a building in the historic center of the city that is worth far more.
The city council was forced to accept because otherwise it would risk jeopardizing the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an extra 100 crowns a month for housing.
From January households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw up to 100 crowns more than they do now.
Electricity is up 4.6 percent, gas is up almost 2 percent, in some areas you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity for apartment households is expected to be around 100 crowns more per year than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the development which is sensitive to encouraging the manufacture of renewable energy, in particular photovoltaic cells.
The gas increases moderately but naturally at the time when people need it most for heating and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count about a hundred crowns more.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the price change for central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the larger municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January, while families in Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city raises infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, the Prague residents will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
The prices of rent will increase considerably, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which has almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase the number of apartments by up to 100 per cent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be brought to court by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in almost 300,000 apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk on rum and Fernet, and beer is out of fashion and does not work.
Fernet, rum, vodka and, exceptionally, the best brand of whiskey are stolen from the parents.
It is the drinks that most often bring into the hands of the doctor those who get drunk before the age of fifteen.
Children who are treated in hospital for repeat offenders are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions to hospital children's wards.
"Beer or wine is out of fashion because it takes time to get drunk".
'The trend is really to strong alcohol,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at the Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to crack a bottle of Daddy's from the closet, it's sometimes whiskey but it's fern and vodka that prevail".
"The advantage of vodka is that they can mix it with fruit juice and not smell it", explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also agrees.
"It's usually rum or fern".
"Alcohol is now fashionable, especially in primary schools".
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from home", Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Department Pelikan, seeing drunken children aged 13-14 years at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before he started working in Horovice last year, he was in Motol where he practiced for ten years in paediatrics, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings, completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood plus a blend with ecstasy", the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party".
"What is interesting is that it did not seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours", said the Department Director, astonished.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of parents or their unusual tolerance of the fact that their offspring are addicted to alcohol that are the main cause of the development of childhood alcoholism.
However, experts say that the word "addiction" is not used in the strict sense of the word for children.
"Alcoholism is a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all its consequences, but not in children".
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background", explained the Department Head of Pelikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about 40 drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home by parents or police after emergency care are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting down and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, there are three seasonal waves that Pelikan says can be counted on: Witches' Day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink in spite of bad results or they celebrate the start of the holidays".
"Of course I experienced on Witches' Day the admission of 7 drunken children at once", said Pélikan.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital for medically supervised detoxification is paradoxically in a better position than the one who went home and suffers the next day from "the hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients needed by the body.
"They are better off for it, as they have a good night's sleep and a good wake-up call and nothing hurts".
"They are just amazed at where they are", adds Pélikan, knowing that sometimes this spoils the patients' good mood at least with the bill to pay for their care.
The cost of transport by ambulance and hospital admission to intensive care beds can be tens of thousands of dollars.
"I used this occasionally as a teaching tool, telling these children how much their drunkenness cost them and that they could spend the whole summer working part-time to pay for one evening", added Pélikan.
However, he said that the declining health insurance companies, which should be recovering the costs of care from parents, are not addressing cases of drunken children.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two L-159s out of five in total, for which the Ministry of Defence has traded Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that such a device has become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad for exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seat versions of the L-159T1 which were until now in service with the Czech Army and which were in flight condition.
The remaining aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Defense Ministry's press department, the physical departure of the Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seaters planned for exchange were taken from long-stored aircraft without causing additional costs or investment for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters have been exchanged in the state", said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not be left without two seats since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the conversion of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second one scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS has committed itself to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"The contract clearly states that the one who takes the L-159s into account is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries".
"It is therefore up to the person who takes the matter into account to determine how this is to be achieved", said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not launch a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defense department argued that the exchange ensures future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and is using only 24, with the intention of selling the rest.
Buying Casa planes is likely to have legal implications.
The European Commission has, however, brought a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected through a European-wide tender and not by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index finger than the ring finger is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have a thumb that's longer than the ring finger have a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British magazine Cancer.
It may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men under 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including in combination with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she and her colleagues in Great Britain followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They and 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers were found to have the same chance of prostate cancer.
For those with a longer index finger than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before the age of 60 the risk decrease was 87 per cent.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, the different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is a longer index.
Previous research had shown that testosterone is the key to prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he was aware of the study but that he did not think the link between finger length and cancer had been "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is covered in snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, where there is mostly heavy snow, the snowplowers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher from the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
At mile 91 a truck was hit, at mile 93 two heavyweights collided, the accident injured people.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometre in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometre at Kyvalka.
A line of cars formed several kilometers away.
Also on the D11 motorway, there's an accident and it's just before the Prague crossing.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car lines are being created in Prosek, and Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transportation is the subway.
Trams are late, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague crisis staff must meet again.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways has already had to cancel 7 express lines because of snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems.
Travelers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11:00 at night until 5:00 in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already passable but with increased vigilance.
On the Vyskov road three side roads are impassable, on the Brno road there are starting to be snowfalls in places and on the Blansko road the chains are mandatory to pass some communication lines in the places placed higher.
The Vyskov region was among the worst affected.
The Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice routes are closed until now.
To clean them, we may need to send snow-plowers and snow-strawberries.
We can't estimate at this time when they'll roll out.
On the road to Hodonin, caution is strictly required in the White Carpathians.
On roads which, for reasons of nature protection, are maintained only by spraying inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimetres of snow, warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and 10 centimeters of snow fell; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The US military has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only by the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an impact on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are laser-guided with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually works like small grenades.
We can program the munitions so that they explode not only in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic path.
So it can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It's not protected from above either, and when a deadly rain of steel shards falls on it, it can knock it out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it basically in such a way that he finds the target, sends a laser beam to it which determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of aim, according to which he corrects his target site and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires at a distance of 1, 2, 3 meters.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next July, 400 employees will move to Astro Park from the current office building on Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese Fujitsu group is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next July the workplace of 400 men and women, which had been located on Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg, will be moved to Astro Park, a huge office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to add 100 additional jobs to the existing ones in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and Astro Park's open-air offices are more suited to the employees' working style.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director-General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure".
He says that the airport connection is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of a major company into the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The head of economic affairs at the Frankfurt Municipality, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global player" had been won.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith in the settlement".
Fujitsu is well suited to the city and its establishment is a major boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this enterprise", said Mr Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the building in the Marienbader Square.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
The aim is to prevent such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the building's owner and landlord will cooperate".
Ten years ago, the City Hall Square building, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "little vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings in Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
A new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall, a joint project between the municipality and a private developer, which drew criticism not only for the impressive layout of the areas that were formerly partly used as parking, but also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer then still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based specialist group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group considers itself the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers for businesses and also provides essential services.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany. Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch moved from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad.The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square metres were rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrical Industry.
Amazon's server expelled - Threats against Mr Assange
WikiLeaks is in more and more trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed from its servers the website that specializes in revealing confidential documents.
This attitude may be masking political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks website is under increasing attack.
The cyber-activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server, which was previously hosted in America, and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the distinguished US Senator, Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks is off the Amazon server".
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom", said the cyber activists behind the revelations on Wednesday (local time) via the social network Twitter.
Not long before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to gain access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now being spent on taking care of people in Europe".
When free speech is a problem at Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN, citing Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after an investigation by associates of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Land Protection had threatened to boycott Amazon, reported the British newspaper The Guardian.
"I wish Amazon had taken this action sooner in view of the previous releases by Wikileaks of classified information", the senator said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of the platform's servers.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and endangering lives everywhere", according to a statement from the independent senators.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks to distribute the contents of the stolen documents".
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to reports in London's newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently described the Swedish prosecution against him as a plot orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats were made against the site.
"There have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange".
That's why Assange is particularly concerned for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's also why the WikiLeaks founder is still in hiding.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the man responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser said on television, in an apparently ironic way, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently disclosed order to diplomats to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should care about the opinion of an individual who owns a website", says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than any website claims".
The US government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, has been appointed to be in charge of combating leaks.
Mr Travers is responsible for implementing 'necessary structural reforms' made necessary after the leaks of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to review the ways in which the entire administration exchanges and protects intelligence.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it will take care of the safety of dissidents and activists should they ever be threatened by the WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary".
The University of the Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day course for the future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where did all the ice come from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, or the somewhat outdated German ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display using a spatula, places it in the waffle, and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream can't avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbet founded the ice cream university in 2003 so that the ice cream produced by its machines would meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day course for the future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered over several days, and practical sessions are held in the private ice cream shop.
In the midst of the crisis of the 40s, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk fulfilling their burning desire on the ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries on every continent, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California, is a big fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to bring a high-quality European product to the land of industrial ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a management consultant and she wants to get something out of this nerve-racking job after a few years.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The ice master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Not only is the taste good, but also the softness and consistency of the silk is important.
However, Luciano does not forget the cherry on the cake of the national and, in general, southern superstructure during the training: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romance".
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program, and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he opens a tap on the machine and extracts a white, pasteurized base cream, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately confronted with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the times.
Those who say that ice cream is "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers, usually natural products, such as guar seed flour made from guar beans.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will eat nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
Master Luciano makes a distinction between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionary section of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and paste.
"the suppliers will all try to refill you with dozens of flavored ingredients".
"However, you should just try".
Or in the recipe for fruit syrups with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in ice cream made from the white base mass which, when eggs are added, becomes a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now all participants in the course must switch to using the ice machines.
Luciano occasionally invites them to make four types of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experiment.
No more flavoring, no more fruit purée: from the point of view of taste, it is not better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not have the taste of walnuts, when it is mostly made up of hazelnuts.
The popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mix can properly enhance the taste of an ice cream", says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use fish puree with a lot of sugar, you have to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
Additional sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (wine growers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical intervention as it once did.
It's not just the basic mass-producing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it unstable and brought to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automation, minor breakdowns are not excluded.
Gustavo, a Brazilian, is sprinkling himself with pureed fruit from head to toe, thus splashing his classmates when he loses control of the giant blender.
Luciano believes that "this kind of incident is likely to occur at every class: it is only a matter of time".
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has undermined the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've got it all figured out", said Mr Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
There are reports that the chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts on genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper has played a decisive role in the development of the EFSA test prescriptions for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr Then.
The requirements laid down correspond to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group in paragraphs and thus bear the hallmark of the industry which is, in essence, controlled by the authorities in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agribusiness group Syngenta without any conditions or transitional period, and in doing so, she changed sides.
Recently, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicion both from the German Federal Environment Agency and from MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion states that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working for Efsa are not prohibited from making contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), based in the United States.
The body considers itself a neutral forum for experts from the fields of science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being a lobbyist.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what the effects of genetically modified maize are, for example, in the field", says Mr Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you discover them?" asked Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region, as in the United States and now also in Europe, the industrial sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
So there are hardly any researchers left who are not linked to societies.
The companies feel that the critical studies will not be published.
Hilbeck says that "industry controls safety research".
The stone trail
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
Monday afternoon, she was outside the Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: By September, the excavators had arrived and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the construction work being stopped.
Broken up into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell-shaped limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft, rough paved area poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor from Ostfildern.
He got a few pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He enthusiastically declares: "A modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly".
He claimed that when he saw her, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with that fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army munitions depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is a dealer in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill", he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard station.
He says he was insulted and threatened when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of Project S21.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to prevent the demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Some 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone pipes, weighing an average of 80 kilograms and worth between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still piled up in the forest, the rest having been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscapers, and private people.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could fit in the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long since been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herb plates.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special", said Mr. Rongen.
"had been the political component".
He gets in his off-road car, goes around his vast 20-acre empire.
He dropped out of law school and later studied biology, later becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carpenter.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons.
He's amassing treasure all over Germany.
He claims to be the world's greatest antique stone dealer.
He's holding back.
Artfully carved sandstones are laid on the snow.
"They were once part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden".
"Elbsandstein, yellow, hot", he says with enthusiasm.
"My favourite stone".
He's taking the path that goes up through the forest.
He pointed to a pile of the finger: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on and so forth.
"Lovely travertine". What is that?
The Parallelpiped was once part of the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
All over the snow of stones and stories, the travertine from Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from St. Blaise's Cathedral, the tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that in the past stones were carved by hand and moved with simple handles and ox-drawn carts, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be torn apart".
He didn't get rich, much less rich.
In addition, stonecutters, a carver, a smith, a glassblower, and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding", says the recycler.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are rocks to be saved there too.
The battle for talent to win the high potential
The counter is very busy.
16 students are rushing to buy salmon sandwiches, tomato sauce and white-bread.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a sort of idea competition, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Many companies today are keen to compete for the best minds and, like Volkswagen, to engage in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit as many of the most talented graduates as possible into the amphitheatres before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, they try to identify outstanding talents in practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group is showing off its talent.
A young lady from the personnel department shares pens, candies, and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of vocational training and student jobs for young talents and shows them the paths to the group premises.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
He believes that there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience".
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at serious candidates and appreciate those who come into the picture as collaborators".
According to Mr Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive approach to attracting students.
"In the past, the emphasis was on the professional project", says Mr Selle.
The struggle to win the new graduates will become much more fierce.
In many sectors, firms can no longer recruit their employees by selecting a selection of candidates.
But they must boast of reliability and above all attract highly skilled labour.
It is mainly graduates from engineering courses who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineers' association VDI, more than 40 000 engineers' posts remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will widen further.
Roman Dykta is hunting for talent for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organises expensive events to recruit talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can visit KPMG's subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The candidate must be chosen in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the crop of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the resources used for the search for high potential in universities are increasing.
"We want to stand out from the crowd by racing cruises".
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent scout Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be in.
"Until now, we have been in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year".
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and wish to send their applications to our company soon", he says.
Apart from direct on-campus funding, SMEs do the classic thing by participating in trade fairs where they brainwash.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade fairs".
"For example, at the solar technology fair", says Sitha Stübe, human resources manager at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company, based in Bonn, employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the problem of succession.
At present, 35 positions are being put up for tender on the company's website.
"It is very difficult to fill vacancies at the moment".
"It is expensive and time-consuming", he says.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example the University of Freiburg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of doing vocational training or writing his final project with us".
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised in the solar industry.
This is why the company tries to advertise itself by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group cannot do this", says Staff Director Ms Stübe.
Money has long since ceased to be the main factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are other determining factors.
According to a survey by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute produces an annual ranking of German employers.
To this end, he surveys employees on their degree of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the employees' framework conditions.
The head of staff, Mrs Stübe, hopes that this placement will help to improve the company's image among jobseekers.
"I think that candidates rely mostly on external evaluations of a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy (DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal action.
"The best way for an employer to make himself attractive is through his own employees", he says.
This is called, in the jargon of the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image among its own workforce.
"satisfied employees are the best messengers".
When employees are treated well and identify with the company, they can easily advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra", says Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, in the southeastern United States, for years to come.
The Washington government issued a ban, an equivalent ban, and thus permanently cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is still prohibited.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April is the reason for this strict ban, which is to remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which killed 11 employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, had indicated that he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of the solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf is, to this day, not definitively settled.
The British oil group, which faces multibillion-dollar claims, is at the centre of the accusations.
An Obama-created commission of inquiry is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Following this decision, several oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter safety guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited following numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing a thorough reform.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of oil and gas groups.
The sector is now publicly warning that the flow of supply in the Gulf will be much lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to curb the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector", according to the results of a recent survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the drilling ban was announced on Wednesday.
The American Enery Alliance laments the uncertainty of the sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation".
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is brownish oil, and it has a smell similar to that of a gas station.
Men live by stealing, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't get tired", the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down. "You're still looking at the oil mud in front of the water lens".
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man submerged in muddy water up to his chest, and the greasy trail around him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored water.
You can't tell that the basement is full of brown patches of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimp in buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil leaked out of a pipeline that exploded in the immense swamp.
Fishermen in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fish-rich waters. The Ogoni Country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The extent of the damage is obvious when you walk through mangrove swamps crossed by rivers.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits into a brunette water; whoever dips his hand into it, gets it all covered with oil.
The roots of the mangrove tree sprout like clusters of lilies, and the lonely palm trees hang on their branches in sadness.
The search for the clouds of birds, as is usually the case in wetlands, is futile. As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on this former paradise that resembles a gas station by the smell it gives off.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment", says Celestine Akpobari, with a sad face. "Our lives are characterized by a constant danger to health".
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region has been a battlefield for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered the area; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed; and in 1993, Shell Group had to stop production activities in the area because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the company is forbidden to return to the Ogoni country: while more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily through more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields in the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters steel skis stand out in the water like strange sculptures: Drill-hole heads are affectionately called "Christmas trees".
They're up to 50 years old, most of them are corroded to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drill head of this nature occasionally breaks into pieces because a constant flow of crude oil is leaking into the water.
Experts estimate that over two billion liters of oil have been spilled on the ecosystem in the last 50 years. Each year, the amount of oil spilled into the sea is equivalent to the amount of oil that was spilled into the sea when the Exxon Valdez supertanker crashed off the coast of Alaska 21 years ago, one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is to blame for the continuing environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the players.
Shell says that sabotage and pipeline seeping are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists say that exploding drill heads and perforated pipelines are the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner criticized Shell for applying much lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "even higher than the rate of fire".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in what looks like an abandoned workshop, full of bamboo, and set up in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with bamboo up to their necks.
A fire is flashing under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to pipes, sometimes scattered for no reason on the site to be repaired: a small underground refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
First, the fuel enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the pipeline, droplets of kerosene fall and finally diesel is produced.
Michael and his four associates produce four 300-liter barrels of diesel every day. "It brings us $34,000", he says, "about $22".
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price lower than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per litre of diesel: because they get their raw material for free.
The oil is being offered by the "protectors" who are drilling the pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country, and according to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very small fraction of the raw material provisionally stored is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military personnel, load the lion's share into tankers and sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate over whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather the subversive activities to the population or the lax production mode to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the fishermen's life-bases were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries".
But in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations, especially with Shell, had deteriorated to the point where it was only a question of withdrawing from the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will be better off".
So Michael gets nervous, and he's like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom".
"It's time for you to get out of here", the robust oilman announced.
"The soldiers may appear at any moment".
If illegal refiners are caught by the special forces, they will not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even the soldiers, mostly from the north of the country, intend to benefit from the raw material like all Nigerians.
"From all points of view, this shit has brought our country down", Akpori laments.
Investigators find design flaws in the A380's reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major safety problem.
When examining a plane that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure".
Qantas Airlines now wants to sue the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, the Airbus passengers of the Quantas airline had clearly been better off: During its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380s had a serious safety problem, and warned of a possible design flaw.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection point of the oil pipeline, according to a position statement published on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
The reactors involved are those manufactured by Rolls-Royce and fitted to 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed a lawsuit against the British reactor manufacturer.
She has filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas' director, Mr. Alan Joyce, has said that his company will seek damages in connection with the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
Rolls-Royce says oil igniting is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors are now in need of replacement worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos, which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the airline Quantas grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the A380's engine as a precautionary measure.
The two-decker plane is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes transport chaos
Germany covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are stopped.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Germany freezes in winter: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover is up to 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the A7 highway in Flensburg, winter staff worked continuously, but they could not cope with the snow that kept accumulating.
In addition, violent gale-force winds swept the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal surges along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels as high as 1.2 m above normal.
The snow piles on motorways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the Meteomedia bad weather warning station has announced the violet alert level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In some places, up to a foot [30 cm] of fresh snow fell, which was scattered by the strong, cool winds.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
Even in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have reported serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind have caused traffic disruption and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, fallen trees on the railways, broken chains or needles.
In Saxony, the inter-regional Leipzig-Nuremberg transport was interrupted.
At Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food, and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfall has caused many cancellations of flights at Germany's main airports.
According to a spokesman for Standard and Flight Information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman said 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the number of passengers stuck at the airport has decreased, but only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In Ostholstein, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg. Here too, a truck was caught in a level crossing because the vehicle was stopped there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car crashed into a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, the weather forecasters have good news: Although the snow will still be soft and dusty, it will swirl if there are slight gusts.
But the wind is going to weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong, swift winds.
It is very cold, however, reaching minus 15 degrees in some places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is looking to divest itself of its logo: According to newspaper reports, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautified the Group's headquarters: the Twin Towers in the Business District have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers have had to return to their former workplaces.
The financial group is now clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as reported by the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He said 'we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and rent them out again at a later date'.
The largest financial institution in Germany had already given up its headquarters shortly afterwards.
It was not until mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for EUR 272 million from equity holders and then rehabilitated them.
The conversion to energy optimisation has cost some 200 million euros.
Of course, a sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently unknown whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have thought about the buried miners who were declared dead in a series of mine explosions.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation at the disaster well remains precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors, aged between 17 and 62, were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and the subsequent explosions, no rescue team could descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent explosion, the authorities and the administration had decided that the miners had no chance of survival.
Until now, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a memorial party for the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered in the sunny Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
They observed a two-minute silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were set up with names, helmets, and lamps.
Photographs and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, were also included.
Flags were flown in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemoration party attendees that New Zealand had hoped the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home".
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose Zen son was buried in the pits, said he can't accept his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the families of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the memorial celebration.
South African and British miners also buried in the first explosion on November 19.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie a made-up movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", an epic of the warrior.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is captured, frees himself from his executioner, and with almost supernatural strength, eliminates his opponents one by one. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is in a bad mood, he tears out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the villain does not say a word about his real name, and even the other characters let slip, at most, in the course of a sentence or two, some terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, we're silent and celebrating in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that was the setting for the Viking world, some 1,000 years ago.
It would be ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy about the fierce and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and experimental cinema.
Most art film fans must be horrified by the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
Action-movie fans are bored to death when the boar embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity in the calm and fog before the crew reaches America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising, then, that Walhalla Rising has not found any film distributors in Germany and is only available on DVD.
This is mainly because the beautiful images of misery have been given some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, is hidden behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It's not about dialogue in this film, or coherent action, it's all about atmosphere, a fever dream turned into a movie.
The viewer cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment's relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with chilly images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the borgne, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
Most of all, the borderline hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning himself into a warrior, may be an emissary of the devil himself.
It represents decay, but maybe also, just for those who are, anyway, decayed.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can either hate or admire, with the goal of annoyance, excitement and amazement.
It was a traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information on a nuclear program being developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, much less to submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of September 5th to 6th 2007 at about midnight, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in Syrian territory.
It was on the banks of the Euphrates, and the nearest major city was Dair as-Shur, some 20 miles [30 km] away.
His name is in the IAEA documents, because it's about the reactor that Syria built with the help of North Korea in a stone pipe, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a US intelligence briefing, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, is well suited to producing plutonium, which would make it possible to make nuclear weapons.
However, this technique has been in use since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite imagery.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the plant was destroyed, which is a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
She also showed pictures of the building nearby and even the inside of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have barely more information than we had then, and even as time passes, the mystery grows deeper and deeper.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only speak of a "presumed reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, and the IAEA lacks it.
Asked how he makes sure he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer this summer, saying that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians must have hurriedly removed the debris from the "unused military building" and made a systematic leveling of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received via a Member State satellite images from commercial service providers showing the time immediately following the attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, possibly Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always maintained that it has never carried out a secret nuclear programme and that it has never built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site came from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it improbable.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as has the satellite image.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to carry out a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and denies access to the debris of the bombed building.
But even Israel is stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this".
The investigation into the case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and "is increasingly turning into a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits, ultimately a serious breach of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, the existence of the three other facilities which must have a 'functional relationship' with the alleged reactor must be clarified.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities are involved, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah respectively as well as the name of the neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite imagery a complex near Masyaf that is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly adjacent to it, which is exactly why Syria is denying access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection team is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by the U.S. intelligence community that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been shuttling between the three sites and the stone parallel-piped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could be "used for fuel production".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing, processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works on unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are some very plausible hypotheses about the following fundamental questions: where did the uranium come from and where did the plutonium needed to make the bomb later be separated?
It is not known whether the engravings, which may hide traces of great value, were stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with earth have disappeared, no one will have any information about where the gravel is stored.
The IAEA is unlikely to have had Syria examine the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from al-Kibar, across the Euphrates, in 1998 to see if it is suitable for storing radioactive waste.
Recently, by analyzing satellite photographs taken for the well-known magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked these to the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria undertook grounding work at the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began requiring access to those locations.
It's possible that it was a coincidence, but that didn't help to rule out suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months drawing up a plan for inspections to be carried out there, which would allow Syria to preserve any possible military secrets.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
If the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor a year ago, the urgency of the matter would not have been reported, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador, who for the past few months has been referring to what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Energy Agency has at its disposal to carry out its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as this diplomat who gives reflection: "What would be the point if in the end they find nothing"
Love in a time of war
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut this summer.
She wrote the script herself: it's a love story between a woman of Bosnian origin and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything else about this story, but it's enough to make us feel uncomfortable.
There is a persistent rumor that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav war.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some of the filming scheduled for Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still going on in Bosnia.
According to reports in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women Victims of War organization sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress, who is herself a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she offered to meet with these women in Hungary, but they declined.
"The meeting is to be held in Bosnia", says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organisation subsequently recommended to the UN High Commissioner that Angelina Jolie be stripped of her goodwill ambassador status.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come afterwards despite this permission.
The young author herself assures that she is not pursuing political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict.
However, it remains vague about the content.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet, which is quite different: the lovers knew each other long before the war began, and they meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference from the version "a rape victim falls in love with her executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now only the Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace by illegally posting this script on the Internet, like so many others before.
Let's shoot him!
Tonight, things are going well again with the Irish.
No sign of dismay.
This is why the local team is over-dominating visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are screaming with joy at the sound of loud music, they're trampling on their feet.
The Baileyu Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is thrilled because players are able to throw and drop table tennis balls from a distance of three metres into the opposing team's beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong", and the winner gets $500 plus a plane ticket to go to the World Beer-Pong Championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, those two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old is looking for a way to have fun, to get away from the big issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling", he says.
"My homeland is so far away and I have no job".
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two days, she has gotten her desired job as event project manager, maybe a good sign", the young man says with a smile.
Due to the bleak prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and her brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young People Go: The situation of most families on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts at the Institute for Economic and Social Research say that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even predict 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, it will be a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic prosperity and great prosperity, the Irish have become a place of mourning.
The economic crisis, however, has particularly affected the well-educated young people of Ireland, who have so far experienced only happy moments.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everybody had a job, there's money in excess.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has a large number of letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything is going astray in Ireland".
"There should be a revolt against the politicians and the bankers, but whoever has the opportunity, is gone and our country is gone for a generation".
"The last one to leave turns off the light".
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing dust in the eyes and offering no prospects for the future of young people.
"They are reducing minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her classmates clinging from one unpaid internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought".
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon is organising the 'WorkingAbroadExpo' which offers comprehensive support on the theme of 'working abroad'.
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to take their first steps in the professional hierarchy", says the official.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a burden, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Sean O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
With nothing left to do in Ireland, the 29-year-old engineer now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house is just coming up in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he takes on an extra job to complete the repayment of the loan to build his home in his home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy", he says as he steps on the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't live practically anymore".
He bursts out laughing embarrassed as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of big brands parked along the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house with his sister for 380,000 euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
"It was crazy, no doubt, money was easy", he says.
Is he afraid that everything will fall apart because of the credit?
O'Donovan pauses, sips a cup of hot tea, and says: "I have no children to care for, and I'm young; even if things go wrong, I can start over".
The building engineer doesn't like the moaning he's been hearing a lot lately.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not as dramatic as what we experienced here on the island", he said.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and in Ireland life just kept going".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Leave the future and find out how life is elsewhere.
He's already got a few years working in London on his record, which is why life in New Zealand must not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that has been worrying him in recent days - the party he is planning for his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might turn into a goodbye party.
"Just not much emotion", he said, sipping a long sip of beer.
"Goodbye, that still sounds disturbing".
"Let's call it a goodbye party, all relaxed, gathering a few friends, having a few drinks and a few games".
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro survey, taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, which was carried out in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has fallen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which drops the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way their country's democracy was functioning in practice, the same as last year but a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shaken support for democracy.
If this has held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly because many of the countries in the Americas have had only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security system has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has increased.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or a loved one was a victim of a crime in the past year, but this is down from 38% last year and the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, cited by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year).
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A tainted vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country in its distress and fear.
Ballot boxes and a new ballot box were presented, ballots scattered in the gutters, polling stations looted and intimidation.
The polls were open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood looking for places to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
Protests, sometimes violent, erupted across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations' senior official in Haiti, considers the event "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are owed to the outgoing unpopular president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is expected in January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round and reaches the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was a fear that participation would be limited.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, obviously, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the foot towards the center
Weeks after becoming a widow, Argentina's Cristina Fernández has enjoyed a surge of public sympathy that has increased her approval rating by 20 points to more than 50 percent, her highest level since being elected in 2007.
Yet whether this turns into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year might depend on the choice of the visibly grieving Fernández, whether or not she will abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And the signs are still confusing.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income as they pleased.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following Mr Kirchner's death of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement have joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a lawmaker slapped one of his colleagues in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress doesn't have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even more leeway to spend as he pleases.
The economy is overheating to a large extent: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims put the figure at close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made growth and poverty reduction a priority over inflation control.
It refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which had falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit next year's wage increases to 18 percent.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth stimulus following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to re-establish Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which sounds like a prelude to the consolidation of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among whom Kirchnerism is very prevalent.
When Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have receded.
If she wants to win another election, she'll have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half an hour to China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on November 27, or 70 percent of eligible voters, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just like that.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayoral seats, he failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned towards full independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this was a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main themes of the Taiwanese election, including noisy campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mysterious forced assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, conducted a campaign tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, just across the face, injuring him and killing a passerby.
Oddly, it was not determined whether the shooter intended to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the continental part itself was.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid showing off its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is in response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy towards China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has sent a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would also like to see political integration, but let us start at the beginning.
It's better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, it was in bad shape when its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms Tsai's leadership and the PDP is doing its best to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells Taiwanese audiences that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's ratings were low; despite skyrocketing economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Much of its unpopularity seems to be due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says his office and local stations will be reshuffled.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to prominent columnist Antonio Chiang, "the point of no return has already passed".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selection in the category of "best new artist"
It's a request from the president, and the people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises at this year's Grammy Awards with a sweeping nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure in the jazz scene since her 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit of a mystery but is consistent with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; this "establishes the public identity of that artist".
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given her slightly engaging vocal style, skilled hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line at Spalding compared to the lightning success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters considering jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a nod to a refreshing thrill from a recording that was one of last year's top favorites.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Shorty, a New Orleans-based trombone favorite with a raucous voice and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans heavily toward certain fusion with albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Steampunk-familiar Wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society won some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category; competing with the rich chamber-jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-adventurous Dave Holland whose live octet's "Pathways" album was a fine example of this bassist's democratic hand as a bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
The nominees include Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yeses"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yeses".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in the running for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for classic producer of the year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album include Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Daugherty from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" from Steven Mackey from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for its instrumental performance as soloist with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a lot of North African rhythms and scales", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez has received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for his performance of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, only soloists are nominated: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots: My Life, My Song".
The Temecula Mosque project wins approval from the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public witnessing, often with enthusiasm.
Critics attacked the project as promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mentioned it", said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that, as an American citizen".
"It shows that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal", he added.
"They just have really loud voices".
"We have good people in this valley".
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, for the most part, people speaking for or against the center, with speaking time roughly evenly spread, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore", wrote one speaker.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families has been coexisting without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse she rented on property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque would consist of two minarets and rise 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
A microbe that tolerates arsenic raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, opens the field to finding new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic".
"That is why it is so special, even though it is far from being a truly 'foreign' life form", commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, six major elements have been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible", said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss the discovery, which did not release details of the discovery, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It didn't.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements we consider absolutely necessary for life may not be fixed", commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", added Cockell.
It wasn't a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute for one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately".
"But arsenic is different enough that it does not work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, in a way, blocks the work of our biochemical machine", explained Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which allowed it to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic could occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more abundant.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common in the early days of the earth, she says, so researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways life formed, not just the way life on Earth formed in the beginning", said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton.
The other two of four show dogs stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembrokes - were reported missing Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van they had spent the night in outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told the AP.
"The good news is the dogs are fine", says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape".
"They have been returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood, or what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say it", said Whitmore.
"We follow orders".
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unable to be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited with their two Akitas Wednesday afternoon at the county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - a 3-year-old male and a 10-month-old female - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional contests this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend for the Long Beach AKC/Eukanuba National Championship, where they're expected to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly month-long dog exhibition tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right by their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Breton Spaniel - and they stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the thicker-fur corgis in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little bit, so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6:00 Tuesday.
Peek said they'd offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It's unclear if any awards were given on Thursday.
The lion's ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially praised the creditors' "pre-packaged" plan to write off about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no legal obstacles left for MGM to get back on the air under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general managers of what will be a lightweight studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 initially.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has entered into a $500 million credit facility to finance MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is itself facing a $75 million funding challenge, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to invest its finances as it could not afford to pay the interest of $300 million per year.
In August, the CEO, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to sell the company.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional 2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, it was time to do it all over again as the MGM team had begun work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debate, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to revive the production of MGM, which has only released one film this year, and put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio is to take out a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the majority shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your budget balanced gifts
While the leading candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's Kinect video game system, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic pearl jump strings, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers -- Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club -- to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
Clearly Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more power; while still costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button-battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some suggestions.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 and up) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you press on their belly.
One push is equal to one note, and a second push composes a song.
If you buy several, they'll sing in harmony.
Be careful, once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For combining singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do the moon dance with its innovative articulated feet with wheel-locking.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complained of a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you'll remember Alphie, one of the first computer-generated educational toys.
He's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3+), with a backpack filled with quiz game cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with self-correction and a valve workbook.
If you're wary of your child holding your smartphone, here are three self-contained alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo ($60, for ages 3-8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don't educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for ages 3-12); it is the first major revision of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No versions are compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3-7 year olds) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30 Hasbro for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by putting the blocks in a row before time runs out, which is ideal for an impromptu spelling bee.
Increasingly, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Penguin Club pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 (for ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough Club Penguin store credits for two items to choose from.
It could be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair on the end of your toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button-battery micro-robot.
The fake bestiole is moving rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone patches in random directions.
It's fun to do a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also solid.
Our dog survived a fall from the kitchen table and even a brief pass in the dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to China's law enforcement
Tang Shenbin was walking around a city square like a city sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous loads, issuing low-key orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - imposing law enforcement officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stay up straight!"
"Be Sharp!"
He said, "Show them what pretty girls look like".
Four girls, barely past their teenage years, wearing white gloves, identical olive-colored jackets and trousers, were staring at the scene.
Four pairs of black heels, aligned with the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance", said Mr. Tang, contemptuously.
"The models are nice".
Several governments have tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a college degree.
Guangdong province has traded the grey-green uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced the blindfold with the strong one: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart, staring at it with a black eye for half an hour, until the smuggler packed his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to do a major image surgery.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police force with 13 women, specially selected for their looks, their gauntlet and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have a hard time getting a look at this underground urban Chinese brigade.
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorised to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news as a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively defeat criminals without shedding blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon smuggler was left with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download, shows Chinese detectives trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government", lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year, after an eleventh controversy over tactics.
The paper called for a "genuine clean-up".
Skeptics say that approach is far from it.
After the district announced in October that it was recruiting eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real jobs or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, ages 18 to 22, to have a good figure and "the five facial features in the right order".
They must be taller than the average, or about five feet, two and a half inches.
Retirement at 26 is compulsory.
Officers said the work was too physically demanding for women over 25.
"It's their image that's important", one district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"First, the candidates' external qualities will determine whether they are suitable; these are height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there's the temperament and the "inner qualities".
Chengguan women are like flower pots, he said, adding: "In addition to being pots, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case for the requirement concerning the order of facial features.
What that means is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, disabled or disfigured people do not have to apply.
"We cannot let a lame person or a hussy come to serve here", said Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't give a good impression".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks that are greasy with a finely curved mouth.
She doesn't consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?" she asked with a look of disappointment.
Xu Yang, a 21-year-old colleague at the pits, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city".
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they had higher career ambitions than simply chasing the vendors into the alleys where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team encounters a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many small loaves or bowls of tofu as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave".
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart.
The officers describe their duties as rather monotonous than arduous.
"It's pretty much the same thing every day", said Huang Jing, 20, who studies after-work marketing.
"Great routine", he said.
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, revolted after false rumors spread that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the square Baoguang, where the female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a shop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was shouting scandal.
A 15-minute standoff ensued before the police, with their grim faces, made their way to their vehicle and drove off at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned over to hide his name.
Like female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 or over - are purely supporting.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxy image.
"Sometimes we fight with words".
"Sometimes we fight physically", said Mr. Li in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the audience starts".
The prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign.
Justice Department prosecutors have dropped criminal charges against Senator John Ensign stemming from a case involving a former campaign aide and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said it was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be subject to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case".
The Ministry of Justice refrained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer on an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was forbidden by law for one year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appeared to contradict the so-called lobbying revolving door ban.
From the evidence that has been released, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the revolving door law", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks by its public integrity section, including the decision last year to drop prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens on charges of misprision of justice.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically means high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's legal team had cooperated with prosecutors in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work for.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marshalling" the Home Office on a contentious issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the Republican leader of the Senate's fourth-tier.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign announced two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and end his investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
The Cheshire call will point to Twitter
About half a dozen of them were tapping away in the courtroom rows.
They were tweeting horrible testimony every minute.
In the end, the defense said there were over 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, the widely-watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to a formal end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted on by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeal arguments that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter by journalists - created a "circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was mis-influenced by the public's passions.
The request could prompt appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"I experienced this in this trial, and I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technology into the courtroom is a violation of the right to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, counsel for Mr. Hayes, the lead counsel.
Trial judge Jon C. Bleue of the state Superior Court laconically rejected the claims in last week's ruling, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the final word on the matter.
The appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland osteopath Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication in courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" on large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which could be discussed for years, delaying the execution.
The defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered harm when Blue J. refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of crime scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge unfairly dismissed one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he unfairly pressured for a verdict by making the unusual decision to have the jury deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial may be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept fanning the flames of the case.
"The daily twittering of media, cameras, and reporters outside the courthouse", the lawyers wrote, "was unlike anything seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide".
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that snapshots were more incendiary than the slower-delivered releases was a Luddite view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that the appeal courts were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological change required adjustment by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their filing, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and they made it clear that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century".
Can civility bring the divides closer?
After a campaign marked by inveteration and negativity, a minimum of civility has erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a sign of a real two-party cooperation going forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues that must be addressed during the "Lumpy Duck" session.
But obviously, at least there was a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities in governing, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
The public meeting of the Chairman's deficit committee on Wednesday was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of mutual testing and testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
So the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the last two years.
Whether it's taxes, spending, health care or rights, the two sides are miles apart.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no doubt that things have changed in tone", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now with the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"It's inevitable after the election.
Elections stir up partisan passions and then they fade away.
That's good".
On some issues, including the one on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve part or all of it, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is looming over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the "Lumpy Duck" session, with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the lame duck session may not lead to better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations", he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing against the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea party who helped create it.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of going too far, and they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their own words, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to put their plan out as an official recommendation, and they've had a hard time getting that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there is little motivation or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the fighting between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then both parties will be watching the public reaction closely.
The one who is judged to be a loser will have to change course and compromise.
But that would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and the polarization is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility displayed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US documents describe Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city is controlled by a "Kleptocracy" and some of the bribes and protection money it collects is passed on to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge raids which help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized crime groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "power vertical" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expunged.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he is largely blamed for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there has been little trace of clean-up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied the corruption charges over the years; and he has won several libel cases on these charges.
In September, when he was interviewed on a Russian TV channel about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he said: "It's crazy, it's throwaway, it's nothing".
The vast majority of Russians believe their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in an embassy report, and it is unusual to imagine that diplomats from a foreign country would do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government", according to the embassy note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term used in the criminal/mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through all the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the Moscow criminal world".
"Luzhkov is on top".
"FSB, MVD and militia are on the second level".
"Finally, the common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level".
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services".
The report says the FSB is stealing money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting the smaller ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law".
"That is why the demand for protection from criminal gangs is not as high".
The note notes that although the money collection is extensive, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who delay payment are forced to close their business for one reason or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption but has admitted little progress.
The embassy note reports men bringing suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats", said Gueorgui Satarov, director of the Moscow-based think tank Indem, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"He is not part of any political class because there is no such class in Russia".
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the cost of corruption in Russia as a whole is estimated at over $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which was not made until late yesterday evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Lukhov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN's Larry King, Putin speculated that the WikiLeaks documents might be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the claims that US diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and associating Medvedev with Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in the domestic politics of this country", he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, unethical".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality, decrepit concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School mentioned the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people", said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality when he was at the helm of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longstanding loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face the people who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch", to 35 years in prison.
This situation has caused increased anxiety among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"The situation is causing family divisions".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, some 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot's government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched a rebellion that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was planning a sequel in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer Rouge veterans have been reduced to the misery of rural Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, these are unskilled farmers with low rank and record.
"These people have received very little follow-up after the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organises public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They were raised in an environment where doing business is a foreign concept".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone".
But now life is hard because we have to support ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to try the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes but it did not say whether it would proceed beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to Im Chaem, 64, former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were allegedly killed.
Recently, during a hot evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his timber-paved house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there are more lawsuits, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned repeatedly that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is about reconnecting the broken pieces", he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand".
The centre produced the first government-approved book on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, comprising 75 pages".
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Vale Touchak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court", he says.
"They're wary because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the courthouse are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
In the high mountains of Dangrek, a path, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, and many people go there to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's final resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-grade uranium stockpile
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons, in a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov here on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were conducted with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military grade uranium from a research facility in Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Obama-initiated Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, which excluded Belarus.
Apparently, it was a good idea to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic after the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This proves to me that this process works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our product... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're just going to use it for research, that's all".
Belarus has moved closer to the United States a few months ago, but has expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first deployment to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia for storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Mineering coordination and organization were put in place to build trust", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of military grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens", she said.
The government has not objected to the CIA's thefts.
The government has made no objection to the CIA flying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which adds that the then First Vice-President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed so that "it could demonstrate that they were exercising adequate surveillance over foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government by surprise" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega has stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "taken by surprise", Aguirre said in a cable.
The then Foreign Ministry official, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to keep this case as low profile as possible, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Attorney General Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not block the judge's initiative to request declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information", the embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States nevertheless expressed concern over "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information from CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter told him that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the action of the PP in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States government", she said.

With this nickname, which she uses since she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both of them from Noia, the village of La Coruña where she is from.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you have to know his love life, which ABC constructs with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they broke up, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The winner was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a nearby town.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to find work, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But from the content of his communications, we hear that their love has broken, they've separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset that I came to work there".
"When I told him, it seemed like a good idea, but of course he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do what he wants".
And then she tells me about a cell phone message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address so I can send the baby to you".
"If he doesn't like it", Ella complains, "let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home".
In May, she spoke of her return to her village: "I'm leaving this week, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because I have to go to work on the 20th so I don't lose it".
She explains that if everything was going well, she would have taken her firstborn with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him of my life with another person if that person is not my mother", doubtful intention, considering their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she typed it, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the first of that month, and had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, was dead.
"Caesar is pleased on one side, but not on the other".
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes it a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day".
She's talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"He'll be there in a few hours in the summer and I'll save a little babysitting money".
The 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come".
"Alberto says he sent you some e-mail videos, you see, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit".
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now-defunct MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the Prison Break".
"Terror in the Galician style (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, the vigilante, says he regrets feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think it was all over because she didn't tell him the fact that she was a single mom.
Mónica entered the Palma Provincial Penitentiary yesterday from the Minorca Forensic Prison.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the events happened, "nor did she intend to harm the minor".
She confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric examination.
The People's Party would win four seats in Congress and the PSC would lose nine.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these committees is normally double that it receives in Catalan.
For example, the Catalan popular party won 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections they had 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which is desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, is maintained, the analysts of this formation have calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular vote, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda holds, the next meeting would be in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the popular may also be decisive in ending the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the mayorships of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get the majority nor the possibility of recourse to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful if this group lost its representation in Barcelona's city council - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its vote count in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP only recorded a 500-vote gap from PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popular vote also showed progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many localities as possible.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by officers of the Barcelona Police Information Bureau were a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laskar e Taiba (Let), the latter being the perpetrator of the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda's international counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" and "therefore its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were forged and then distributed to groups that were part of the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "fighters" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one the jihadist network has been operating in Europe, which is why other European police units have been involved in the investigations, apart from the Thai services, which is why there could be similar shootings in the European Union in the following days as the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was conducted in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikan Kilayajbumrung.
They were the ones who ran the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - stole mainly passports from tourists who met the conditions set by the so-called "Global Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents had to be in the name of young men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking the detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, a few thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a wire transfer agency, which were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were later used by the "commando" members who killed 106 people.
The police have seized a wealth of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend the tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions for supporting his inauguration as President of the Generalitat, identical to those presented during the campaign and which are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address in the middle of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan Popular Party arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that she had obtained 18 deputies in the elections on Sunday, a number more than enough to make herself liked, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the inauguration.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an inauguration "all sovereigntist and independence-seeking discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - which the convergent leader wants to submit even to a referendum.
The two leaders have in common their aim of weakening the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax on inheritance and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas's appointment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot Center don't rule out the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people.
The officials of the geriatric charity in Olot (Girona) held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his time there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared with the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the prosecution against the responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting the night nurse's criminal activities in time, the major threat to La Caritat now comes in the form of a substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was in August 2009 and that from that day on he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he was ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - but he suspected that in many cases no doctors personally examined the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality was done by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures could not at any time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is only one indication of imprudence in this case on the part of anyone other than the accused".
The person already christened as "The Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting her with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the centre's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and a combination of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine murders that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the sufferings of the inmates, used to kill them.
But the lab tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already admitted he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
Caritat does not believe the night nurse's statements, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not rule out the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after successfully committing eight murders.
They therefore declare that they will remain at the disposal of the justice system to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "the markets must not underestimate our capacity to react".
The spreads on peripherals closed strongly and European bank shares fell by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's capacity to err, and the euro has barely increased, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which, in the same way as it collapses, recovers, but driven by short and highly speculative positions closures.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended 'at least until March' and that the quarterly auction with unlimited access will be maintained at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-buying programme will be continued and that the signal will even be given to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blind to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
Just like at their May meeting where they said they hadn't even considered buying bonds and they crashed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the one-year-old pig auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the numbers from the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The figures are estimated at 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalised.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are acceptable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions ahead of the next summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, when a political compromise is needed that shows that we are one and that we all interpret the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of the world Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatisation, measures to revive employment are all ringing in the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the Government and the Bank of Spain reacted quickly and decisively and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond which will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has over 40 billion in liquidity available, triple what it had in March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the markets without die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, to appear".
We can get out of this.
The President of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm continues in the conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "no right", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José give their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services for companies does not seem willing to give in to his dispute to be present in the board of El Enebro.
He was excluded from its board of directors by five of its seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January of this year, the contestation of which is registered in the Commercial and Companies Register.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to appoint the assembly is, until the dispute is resolved, the only mechanism which guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal by the plaintiffs' five sons to try, through a procedural wit, clearly fraudulent the law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the radically void assembly on January 18", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the contestation of the assembly as "null in its own right" once it has taken place.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless seeks the usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to the usual protocols.
This case is the substantive issue which the judge must decide after the hearing on the appeal for which there is not yet a date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software makes improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this select world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final stage of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without diminishing the skill of the champion driver, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, the world of Formula 1 speaks of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing tool has been used to create assembly lines for factories all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, to simulate the product or process accurately before building it in a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in his Formula 1 factory enabled Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
We're changing the materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety features.
Changes can be transferred from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological improvement is the amount of $40 million that each Formula One team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a locality 30 miles [50 km] from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that goes on there is considered top secret.
The staff for this task is 580 people, including two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula One, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety zero.
The plant's technology director, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R & D progress in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots provide 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 new stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of a network of 20 shops, ranging from 80 to 100 square metres, which the multinational plans to set up in Spain over the next two years.
The company will include this initiative in the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The example of the refurbished shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years, was given by Helena Herrero, vice-president of HP Spain.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded retail outlets in Europe by 2013, a strategy that includes all 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for setting up the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and designs the exclusive furniture for the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which will have the same image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program at global level that solves possible problems with HP's computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connecting to a technical centre in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days".
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services", Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on 'stealing' a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war on liabilities.
However, it does foresee a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need for public subsidies from FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new retail customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its big task to accomplish, because up to now this bank had more ruined SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private clients and 50,000 corporate clients.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it is more than 10%.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, on austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell will in fact finalise its Optima master plan, drawn up four years ago, this year, although the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
The customers who let the savings banks slip will be his main target.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
He also stressed that in two or three years' time it would be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the banking business.
And even if he thinks that the war of liabilities - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for their issues to obtain liquidity is already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor of credit pressure".
"We haven't tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already ordered its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive environment".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth although, as always, the group does not rule out the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "greater dimensions will be called for".
"Everything will move next year", he assured.
He says that capital needs are "increasing enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could be in the red.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed the fact that some bankers are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He said that we cannot issue, but unlike what happened in June, we can get short-term financing through breaks, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the banks
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and reiterated the speed with which the sector was being restructured.
When the Spanish savings bank merger process started, several entities stated that they would not participate in the first phase and that they would reserve themselves for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been completed, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, it is adjustments".
"Most of them have been completed; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, which has also collaborated a lot in this operation", the head of the bank said.
In his remarks at a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is taking place within the time limits that we have set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"The move from 45 funds with an average volume of assets of 28.500 million to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to be in line with Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slow pace of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding that the deadline must be met before the end of the year".
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and he blamed those who questioned it for "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "going at the greatest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had made a good recovery from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have led to a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of unemployment benefit without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, speculation is beginning in Germany on three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first is a strong euro, which would integrate itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would leave the monetary area.
The second is the recovery of the Mark, even though now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third is a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigor, fines for countries which violate them, possible suspensions of payments for one of them and the extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigour and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow from the Central European country was when Merkel barely extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time to oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, was approved and in the months to come we should see the process of reform of the Union that will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare a default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we must follow a hard path of growth with high saving and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The stakes are clear.
And it would be a shame not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked to do is much harder.
And what he should never do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will bring us a greater peace.
And we'll take the opportunity we've been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting with big business last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the way has been opened for the thesis that we need to get things in order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to be moving it.
And one of the possibilities we are considering is to abandon a monetary area which is too full of unimportant countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that they warned us.
Sport and law-breaking
Tricks similar to Alonso and Ramos's against Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 Champions League match against Ajax has caused much speculation about the anti-sports nature of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next game of the block match against Auxerre and can go without cards to the next stage.
Eventually, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and various economic sums to the players involved.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of the sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that this was a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and has in the past fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any event, the debate is on whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulation, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether such actions are in breach of the law, since they are indeed actions which respect the sporting regulations, but which seem to elude their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they do to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that comprises the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that has not been endangered by these actions, that is to say there has been no violent play.
Another of these goods referred to with the correct play is to prevent the offending team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is also not the case.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they do not accommodate themselves to what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because their violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They waited and they willingly accepted the punishment.
Another question is the type of advantage that offenders derive from the intentional wrongs examined.
It seems necessary to note here that one does not put one's opponent at a disadvantage and one does not gain an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes the fact of leaving one's own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on those players.
The advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indecision, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, going up the ladder, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which nevertheless includes making strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit that the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud against the law), but rather chose the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without dodging the penalty or running away from that one.
Although the line between genius and law-breaking is blurred, I think we have a clear case of genius here.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way the director was sent to provoke them.
The damage to sporting principles caused by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive bidding to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who are willing to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives, the group dinners before Christmas also return, which continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to capture the majority of customers: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with the businessmen and associations in the sector interviewed.
To further complicate the accounting, this year's calendar (since New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in a flurry of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost none the week before.
Since 2008, which is the beginning of the hard times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To keep up the tradition, many employees organize them out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative now dares not predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before they book".
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices", he says.
The business will be good "for those who provide quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so that the 25 euro range has become the majority of demand.
A survey of various centres in the centre shows a collapse in applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group says there is a real boom in demand for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the current situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar meant more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they explain.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half of the year and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources within the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day for groups of friends who celebrate the holidays early.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as the famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees back and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a bit.
On the part of the Fecasarm group (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Entertainment Association), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, is confident that the end of the tunnel is about to begin and maintains that overall bookings are "alive", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, he says, but the hope for the festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays for them.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that are being raised in Washington about Pakistan's nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details they offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
Thus, in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan listed: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban attack, the scattering of nuclear materials with low noise, and the vulnerability of nuclear material transport".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain vigilance.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the declining educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs", said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev during a meeting with his US counterparts.
The new thing in the leaked documentation from the Julian Assange portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high degree of nuclear weapons production.
A May embassy dispatch, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often lacking; offers of help go unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite economic disaster, Pakistan is developing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama will appoint a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track" Assange's movements.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, this one's not new, unless it's dated November 20th.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million US diplomatic documents but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer who founded Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
The 20th International Police Force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol were instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest warrant for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free-for-all for arrest - which the national police force must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder has shown himself willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter said.
While the world is searching for him - and in Australia his mother is defending his innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype from an undisclosed location, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States signed, she should resign", he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us", he told CNN.
Obama himself has assigned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to downplay Assange's importance is in contrast to the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to retract his statements after saying that Assange would "be assassinated".
"Obama should make it a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something".
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind of a punishment", he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winking eyes at Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposed a more plurality of executives and an end to the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving the eleventh internal revolt within ERC, without a north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and that this can by no means give him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win over his new critics with a wink that allows him to blind himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuation in secret.
By ballot, not by raising your hand.
If the cartoonists want to convey some sort of penalty vote to the president, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to himself.
In several interviews he said he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand a little more from the president than to make his position available to the militants, a move that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which management will submit to the national council for voting on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his aim is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry in the family room.
In this line, the article that the current councillor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he listed five, and he highlighted two.
The first is to "recompile" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new figures who come from the Carod-affiliated sector.
The second may be the character of big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly once and for all as a working mechanism.
He advocated a reform of the statutes which would allow congresses to be held through elected delegates.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of Puigcercós' team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 tasked the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific constitutional reform congress.
This meeting is still incomplete, because the internal tide of recent years has not recommended discussing this subject.
Now, with no critical areas on the lookout, it might be time to take it back and shut it down for good.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the Millennium State of Mexico, the number of cases has decreased by four compared with 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two mutilated bodies in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theoretical connection with organized crime.
One such case was that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, Toluca.
Subject had at least three gunshot wounds and the head wound, except for the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan Municipality.
Early Thursday morning, the four, the owners of the communal land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
A message was found near the body, supposedly signed by the La Familia Michoacana criminal organization.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was shot eight times as he was leaving his house to start the garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-old men were killed by a gunshot wound to the head in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the gunshot wound to the forehead, a man's body was found on a lonely road in Colonia El Naranjo and a bullet from a .25 caliber gun was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in the blackwater channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
Emergency services have conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body, but they have not been found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a dead body in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In mid-month, two men were reported to have been executed, wrapped in blankets and left in the trunk of a vehicle on the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda district in Atizapán, Zaragoza. Two death warnings were also found alongside the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two women wrapped in blankets were found in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a Huixquilucan man was located who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being identified in principle with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman's body was found with gunshot wounds to the neck in the San Francisco hamlet of Acuautla.
The woman's skin was found to have Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image on them.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found beside a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with a scratched head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed by a criminal organization, saying: "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found with signs of torture and with their hands and feet bound inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín Colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag on the streets of Colonia Juárez.
The cops found a bristle with a message next to him.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of this country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by between 40 and 45 percent.
China is sticking to its pledge to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and rebuild its industry.
In fact, he explained, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which recognises the targets set for reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and local authorities to achieve the targets of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multiannual plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another one for changing incandescent lamps to energy efficient lamps and another one for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than people think.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution in pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do another similar effort around 2020, he said.
The legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN explained that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
PAN national leader César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
In the interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo took over as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonoran Regional Commission".
"Mr Espino has the right to complain, if necessary, to the National Council's Commission of Order, so this is a decision taken within a competent body", he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, when a successor would be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal", he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it makes us stronger", he said.
He said that probably the council will be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the job "to the person determined by the council".
"I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's recovery in the July 4 elections will be reflected in the next debate, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012".
"At the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerge from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and a reason to observe throughout the country, so that "a lot of hope has been made in their regard, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years in government, César Nava asked priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón, let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet", he said.
He said that the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law for undocumented students on Twitter
"If you agree with the passing of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation", Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps a cyberlink open with a larger document asking the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to listen to your voice", he says.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continues.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by all 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think we have plenty of time"...
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year"...
"I think we can get an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, though most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they've stayed in this country for the last five years, and they've been accepted into a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at a time when the organizations supporting the bill are leading an intense lobbying effort to ensure the bill is passed.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why the Dream Act supporters need the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most-loved Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
Literature is the way to put a finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants displayed the narration
"Sex in language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of Language, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and which this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in language, she explained).
The finger on the wound"...is embarrassing", the Argentine writer gently launched to the audience, mostly young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
She comes out of the infectious disease clinic convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, it may be my wound".
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the trauma doctor who cut his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is the one who is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be closely linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also gave a fascinating account, which he called "Praise to the Invention", in which the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, made people return who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to then talk about America, the great news that from the beginning had its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narrations of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in stories presented as real, but in a way that would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty".
Nevertheless, he stressed, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is what we call the Cervantes tradition.
"It's your heritage that makes you what you are".
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with her roundtable Debt on the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman has put her own on the great wound of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - resulting in drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated", she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the speech of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that is moving at a rapid pace, also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that is being used to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuancing often means putting our finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established and unvarnished ideas and disturbing also the powers that prefer a black and white world", he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he's had ups and downs in his career, but he's managed to reach the deciding series three times.
With Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that are facing each other, marked by their technicians, who find between them a marked contrast in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach the deciding series three times, even though so far he has not scored and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up consoled by the runner-up medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament in 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also reached the deciding duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again as his team made a 2-2 draw against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he got a 3-1 lead with two chances to win the title and eventually three of his players missed by 11 metres and he suffered the jump to a 4-3 result.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to break away from the evil to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important", commented the driver when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers much of the last final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can take is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I believe this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which he does not worry about, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the penalty series, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we just have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate turned us wrong, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of holding the title in our hands, it escaped us, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope that we do not get into that situation again".
Romano now has the opportunity to stop being a technical runner-up and taste the glory of the title for the first time.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
People should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa processing procedure at the US Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer needing to make a payment for an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the postal service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-off payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for an on-demand visa (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for a business and investment visa.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not have to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Because the biometric information will be taken from the ASC, applicants who wish to have a second interview at the Consular Section will spend less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26 USD.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA to announce discovery of alien life
The United States space agency has called the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When citing the press, NASA assured that it would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us in hostile environments that were previously thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that this is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment that was once thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Either way, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life, and this ability makes us think that similar life might exist on other planets that don't have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true extent of the findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), with the prospect that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón opposing 'bloc'
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, the advent of 'bipartisanship' is being denounced.
The 60th was just getting under way when an opposition bloc led by the MPs from PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent, appeared in the Congress and all four were questioning one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the opening of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo were 'toning' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, they are initiating 'bipartisanship' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MEPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-Chair.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme based on a political will and if they do not have it, they will be enslaved by both parties again and thus the opposing coalition will end.
"So far as (the opposition coalition) has come, that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
He said that the Congress, which was once a monopoly, could not be allowed to become a "duopoly".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that there be perpetual bipartisanship in Congress".
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Members of the European Parliament to five.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has become a 'booty' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it into two".
Patrón Montalvo asked that the honourable Member's personality be respected and that he be allowed to sit at the negotiating tables.
"They will not leave out by coupled agreements 5 who will probably be 9 deputies, now the five we see, separated into different factions, we decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they made, that they decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform".
$200 million more for the "supplier"
The Mazatlán City Council pays another check to the respondent, the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check for approximately 200 thousand pesos to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the last check, number 9258447, was issued on 16 November for the amount of 200 mil 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of supplier accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Municipality would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Auditor General to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, cheque boxes will be issued again in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just paid him what we owed him, like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques were "re-issued" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, as required by the Act, that when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this after Noroeste had published a review of the checks that the City issued to its suppliers on July 25, revealing that between March 2008 and July 2010, during the three-year tenure of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also conducted transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be cleaned
Tourism entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions at the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a ditch at the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants Association, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the destination's image be cleaned up and that new activities should replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk around and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, else they wouldn't do the work for so long and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist drop exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The mayor will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and not just doing the corrective", he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, not only because it is a tourist area that needs to be maintained, but because residents deserve a clean place to live and the City Council needs to change its strategy to properly maintain the city".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito in Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions", he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this kind of fact points to something that is well known to all, maintenance is needed".
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not being used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that need to be aligned with the municipality and be a priority to have the city updated, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Luckily Mazatlán offers many sites and historical and cultural sites that we should first order, clean and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination".
IP calls for results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector in Mazatlán is calling for a Labour Legislature that is dignified and free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 people's representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the governmental Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to protect their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups".
That is why I ask them to certify their commitment to establishing the necessary bridges which will make the current Governor progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified job and above all engage with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 representatives of the people is to push and add strength by seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate job creation".
As regards tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and competes directly with agribusiness".
Apart from the fact that resources should be allocated to tourism projects that help to provide security to the state and update the Alcohol Law that the previous legislatures could not solve.
We're looking for a wizard king
Dolls, cars, and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, as their household is made up of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar, and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it is very difficult for us, because my husband has no job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell in the street", says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaida, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted a monster truck, and Cayetana has suggested a year's worth of size clothes for his eight-month-old brother Jesús.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have that monster,' but I said 'we'll see, my son,' because it was very expensive", Cayetana sadly recalls.
For older children, who was in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isaías, 10, wears size 10, and Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
Juan, 14, needs a pair of sneakers, so a size five and a half or a size six would be a great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family's children a reality you can join the On Searching for the Magician King campaign by donating a toy or money to the Northwest reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
Around 10 searches were carried out in Estria on Wednesday in connection with the dismantling of a network for the production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations allegedly used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the courthouse in Sherbrooke within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of producing cannabis, possession with intent to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were the result of a lengthy investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information from the public that enabled us to make these arrests", Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Regiment took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should address the problem of ships carrying illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated after the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter".
"I stand with a party that has created the granite under your feet", said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year's detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it is targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does", said Mr Duceppe.
NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism that her party is not being firm enough on illegal immigrants.
"The NDP is in favour of action against smugglers and we are doing so through another bill, C-35", said Ms Chow.
"We don't support the Conservative bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year", Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs in droves that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a pawn shop".
"They expect Canada to take firm action", Minister Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections if it was rejected.
However, a Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would call for a vote so that any MP who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not new: Quebec has consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet Tuesday's announcement surprised many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Standing Council on the police services of Quebec on 29 October this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was not long before the Pequist public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron called the announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a handmade solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it", he says.
"We are aware of this problem".
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have an inquiry committee is for Jean Charest to resign", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
'We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General,' he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squadron is not the only project in the cards of the Charest government.
The Commission also proposed that the Court should consider whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the question whether the Court should rule on the matter.
This request is alleged to have come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague Rob Nicholson, Minister for Justice, is currently considering some amendments relating to this matter.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which targeted motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa later passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under close surveillance
Several rivers remain under intense surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide is said to have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has fallen.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall, from 40 to 70 millimeters, fell in several areas.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could get up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear that several rivers will overflow.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentides, and the Chene in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watch and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes in St Julienne, St Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon to overflow.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was washed away by heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Ottawa, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security remains on high alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center issued severe flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup, on Wednesday.
Dupont partly blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio-television Standards Board (CRST) for controversial remarks about social welfare and Haitians as well as his rude language on the airwaves.
The CCNR found that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their opinions, but that some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts".
The Council also concluded that a discussion of suicide, including the release of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The NCCR had received several complaints about comments made during programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the programme were inaccurate.
Presenters should present solid information rather than misleading information.
As for suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had felt that suicide was a cowardly act.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
'The majority of the Committee considers that the disputed episodes of 'Dupont midi' have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner.'
So no blame was laid upon him.
The last case concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then engaged in a face-to-face media event which had aroused many reactions.
The CHOI host said that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that the needy people would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this".
"My record has been blank for a year and a half", the host said.
In all its decisions, the Committee condemns the use of profanity.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM cooperated 'beyond its obligation'.
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montreal native of Algerian origin, Nacereddine Zemmal, has a very special career.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing, and Thai boxing climbs the world's tatami and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to train with professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, since for those who don't like the ground game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America".
Recently, the UPS security guard and contractor delivered some bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to go to China for the World San Shou Cup".
"Fighters who finished in the top four at the last world championships in each category were invited".
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth, while in 2009 I came third in Toronto", he added.
"What's interesting is that I've progressed in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be number one this time or next year!"
San shou or sanda is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as projections to the ground, are allowed.
Duels are originally held on a platform and less often in a ring.
The most famous boxer to come out of this form of combat is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will surely return his presence at the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This is the most prestigious and prestigious competition in China", explained the friendly young man.
"It's a bit like Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)".
"It was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The man who beat me was a real pro", he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)".
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category face off to crown one champion, the king of kung fu".
450 million in contracts without invitation to tender
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts is a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has been awarded the largest, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was formed in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec decided to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the energy management consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
The use of consortia of undertakings poses a serious ethical problem for the Parti Québécois, which risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
"This is the new way to collude and kill the competition".
"That is to say, people are now doing it openly instead of doing it in secret", said MEP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Mr Simard raised the matter in the National Assembly earlier this morning because he said he could hardly see how the public interest could be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded this afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to get my journey", she said, claiming that the PQ had been "dishonest" and "lacking in rigor".
She said that "it would be the least of things" for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is highly complex given the scale of the work.
The construction is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition; there was negotiation.
The consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is under investigation by the government.
A quick look at the Quebec business register reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau is working in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
As regards the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay area responds to particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec has responded to this in a particular way since the 1970s".
The Eastmain project's chief executive, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave a sobering explanation that the project management contract was granted voluntarily.
"If you go to bidding and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher".
"You have two choices: either you take the people in this market and say, 'We're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.'
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's the skill of the people", Mr Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is one of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 won by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, in particular soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Energie Gerance.
All the contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract to Energy Management.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau omitted to mention that the PQ is also linked to the firms that "fund" it, before clarifying that it was rather its managers.
Responsible consumption barometer - The green label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Québec consumer has very little confidence in the sustainability actors, but also in fair brands and eco-certifications to guide his choices.
Even if he is immersed in a media world where messages in favour of more responsible consumption abound, he regrets the lack of credible information, which he even describes as a hindrance to his commitment, says the Responsible Consumption Barometer, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies and the green advertising of companies, according to the measurement tool developed by the Responsible Consumption Observatory at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certificates for so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands advertised as being eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the political discourse on this subject seriously.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this aspect of consumption, which is currently enjoyed by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
The lack of information and the doubtful nature of the information would calm the anxieties of 46% of consumers.
This is the second barrier identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers also express suspicion about the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put in their hands.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to meet their beliefs.
61% also preferred to buy from local vendors and preferred to buy food products grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by being concerned about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to be outside his car, the Baromètre notes: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this large behavioural survey, which has just taken its first snapshot.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus et le Parallèle, agreed to cooperate, but only on a loan.
The development company Angus et le Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and give it back its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they were asking for.
The government is willing to get involved in this case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is offering a loan, the amount of which would be lower than initially expected, which could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least according to the opinion of sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris case.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet's counterproposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the State grant hypothesis must really be dismissed.
It should be recalled that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de parcs cinématographiques du Québec opposed direct State investment to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders in the community were instead calling for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the ceans, kept the author's cinema in his premises for ten years after financing its construction himself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
There's a huge shortage of independent film theaters in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to retain a loyal following.
The Angus and Parallels Company, headed by Christian Yaccarini, is also running a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
As of spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast movies on eXcentris.
The future buyers plan to reopen the three theatres on 27 February with the screening of Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not call Le Devoir back and it is not known what he and his group think of the downward proposals made to them.
The veil is lifted over a complex Canada...
The new US diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks reveal what the US sees as the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but they also betray the feeling of superiority of Canadians towards Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassies in Ottawa and Washington, which were leaked to the public yesterday, offer more crunchy details than substantive content to be checked.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, during the federal election campaign, reports how far the United States is not among the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins, the United States was the only country in the world to have a nuclear weapon.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be conditioning Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of the day rather than focusing this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
The United States, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about".
The ambassador is all the more unable to understand the "deafening silence" as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more so a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote", he said.
Another expression of this sense of importance is found in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, the Ottawa business official, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the vote of confidence in the federal budget in early February, when Canada will run its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30 to $40 billion stimulus plan", writes Breese.
Nowhere does it mention that the government had to prorogue parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that CBC drama series are sending back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the shows Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which make subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's abductions for intense interrogation.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, he handed the Secretary of State a paper about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The secretary has agreed to review the file".
Finally, the public is warming up to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former close adviser to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for the massive leak should be "assassinated".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that is almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan follows on from the major concrete projects which the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs, which still control 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent light bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's the equivalent of 70 percent of the emissions from the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should bring global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will have to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to stabilize the rise in climate by 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95 percent of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5 percent is produced as light.
With fluorescent light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by a further twofold.
The average life of a fluorescent light bulb is 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New LED bulbs, such as those being launched by manufacturer Philips this week - the company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Many experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place guidelines.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorescent light bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the gains each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost the country 2.5 billion dollars to build.
Côte d'Ivoire anxiously awaits election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the release "immediately" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent election commission to complete its work and announce provisional results without further delay", a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced".
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the deadline of midnight on Wednesday to pass without announcing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CIS president told a television broadcast that the committee was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Calls were mounting around the world on Wednesday for the CIS to finally announce the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebel Forces Nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi NGuessan, campaign manager for the Ivorian president, said that the FN's voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had dissuaded the outgoing president's supporters from going to the polls.
The whole election could be annulled if Gbagbo's complaints are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao Ndre, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any links to the former rebels, called the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo is blocking the results because he knows he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from releasing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to be the culmination of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been divided for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the lead of the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (ILO), has remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area (9.7% including overseas departments), according to the provisional seasonal adjustment data (CVS) published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in the metropolitan area is 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% in the DOM.
Over the course of a year, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.1 percentage point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available to work within two weeks and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market further deteriorated, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over a year) and 25% including the DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
The elderly, on the other hand, experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), or 482 000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% in the DOM.
Only the 25-49 age group enjoyed a stable unemployment rate in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
The Insee has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, following a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, however, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the GNP) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Interrogated and Imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône general council, was questioned and detained at the Luynes detention centre near Aix-en-Provence in connection with an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of public property, embezzlement of public funds and property, conspiracy, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies".
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of wrongful charges, but it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of the PS's strongman in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had to send the judge a memorandum to explain himself before the hearing, through his lawyers.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also questioned Wednesday night and beheaded.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of the funds linked to their operation, he never knew about it, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was put on trial on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and released under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation for the facts alleged against him".
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty", said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were questioned and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the Marseille Provence Metropolis (MPM) clean-up, is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are under investigation, one for "stealing and embezzlement of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "abuse of social property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money for big banditry.
The investigation is being conducted in the context of several legal proceedings opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
The investigations, which are close to the investigation, focus on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill at La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne and some cities in the Marseille urban community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept French public opinion on edge, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the United States diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the underlying causes of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a raw light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to credibly claim that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The French Foreign Minister, François Richier, the Elysée's adviser on strategic affairs, and the French director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are meeting with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They're explaining the French method to him.
They are advising Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "hammering on" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocency", "immediate release".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to".
After attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of delaying maneuvers".
Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (€230,000 as bail).
And he says the Elysee is anticipating more hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he said.
28th of August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but she's still stuck in Iran.
The information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being demanded by the United States for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, by a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran's clandestine networks of procurement of equipment for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand's enlargement is bad news.
Has France accepted a bargain ?
The Iranian's liberation against the French's?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
Elisha, he says, was not only "completely taken by surprise at the judge's decision", but he tried to resist it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the keeper of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision", he observes.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elysée has been making every effort, through press releases and media leaks, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles echo the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the basis for so much "gratefulness" expressed to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their praiseful statements, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then looks at the reasons why the Elysée was cast in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and unmerited".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can win by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy has a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything".
"But we thanked them anyway".
"It should at least confuse Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Élysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for Korean youth after midnight
The South Korean government is going to pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to require online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight for youth under 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and living a normal life during the day".
"We believe this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the ministry official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time for these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who request it free software that will help to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various incidents related to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world's online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
FIFA chooses the host countries for the 2018-2022 World Cup
In the midst of a turmoil over suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday named the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice where influential struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Fifa Queen's Cup will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities represented in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives a measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
So the backstage negotiations may go on until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) records have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which was behind the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) for corruption, may have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC has added a layer of detail to this by broadcasting a documentary on three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is enough to displease FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the lead.
The head of government hopes to repeat the coup achieved by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore Britain's standing with the EC?
The Spanish-Portuguese duo is no less certain, with stadiums already ready, expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the British and doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a weighted outsider despite the shortcomings of its record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a scarcely veiled reference to the accusations of the British press against EC members.
"We are covering them with mud, we are trying to compromise them", Mr Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has benefited from the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favourite.
The world's leading economic power, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to be a step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very good project separately.
But these new applications seem premature for two countries that co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which FIFA so desperately wanted, would effectively render Asian chances for 2022 null and void.
With Qatar, which has taken the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it seem as if he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One warrant at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence doesn't go well with the mystery of the presidency.
So we have to pretend that the doubt is still there.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he spoke to UMP parliamentarians at the Elysee on Tuesday evening has caused some concern about the prospect of a "two-term" term.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The President was merely reminding that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was just making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has made a humorous reference to the presidential election in such meetings.
"At best or worst, you have seven and a half years left with me", he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about what to do next".
His remarks from the day before yesterday do not make him a better candidate than the day before; they do not make him a lesser candidate.
If they're getting comments, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious, many in the PS are calling for a battle-order earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-LExpress).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
"If he thinks defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win", Alain Juppé corrects, apparently resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to keep buying government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) for the year was to be the occasion for clarifying the modalities for a way out of the crisis or, at least, for announcing the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations which are due to end at the end of the year.
The Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to afford to be so decisive, lest it aggravate a situation which is now more than tense on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the greater.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it believed the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European partners . . ".
The ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more clear about his intentions when he was heard by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Brussels the day before, saying only that the programme for buying government bonds on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" at Thursday's meeting.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt that market operators are expecting further purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in direction.
While the ECB has already eliminated over three-month borrowing operations, it still makes unlimited cash payments on generous terms for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine she's making any major changes to her program".
"Otherwise we risk creating new short-term tensions", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to Oppenheim.
As regards its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to keep the market in a sluggish state", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the size of the exposures of European banks to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
'It must at all costs make up for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states,' testified a major bond manager yesterday.
If interest rates soar, governments will find it all the more difficult to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
The euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back on the EU
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased somewhat yesterday with the fall in the 10-year bond yields.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unfathomable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of CDSs had soared to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "turbulent markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the accompanying tax revenue slump, which risks the state being unable to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate is 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
This is why there is a rumour of a new budgetary collective which could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken", says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, as we have been saying for a long time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its large debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries", observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to early elections at the end of March.
This would open up a difficult period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans considering strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde, speaking at a press conference in Paris yesterday, said: 'I think the Europeans, as we demonstrated again on Sunday night and day, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area.'
Although relative, the easing of European government bond rates yesterday has been a watershed moment for governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of the beginning of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it may downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most widely targeted by speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly affecting the banking systems", say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this gap and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts are going well.
And this is also in view of the Euro-Group and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The menu includes the fate of non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
The European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) Executive Director Klaus Regling started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in Europe.
If the purpose of such visits is not to raise funds, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
The first issues of EFSF bonds are due next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The leading countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are in addition to the more effective austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both are determined to avoid seeking international aid before implementing their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
On 24 November, in Paris, Axel Weber was the first to suggest that if the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get its hands on the portfolio.
The economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle is there: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which has so far been endowed with 60 billion euros.
A proposal which is likely to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions got worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall is still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne were added to the 20 departments already under orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is affecting the north of Gironde and the Charentes and there is little snow on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers of 2 to 5 cm, occasionally 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is sufficiently severe to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been banned from carrying heavy weights of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking your vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation has been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris' Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to coming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been pouring in.
In the discussion, at least.
In particular, 23 billion is being spent on the Grand Paris metro, which will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this PPP, the State announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then enable the GSP to borrow on the markets part of the financing of its double loop.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, which was considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the provisions for the origin of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, reads the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is stated: 'The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros a year.'
The second is a reorganization of an existing office tax "to modernize it, increase its revenue and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a mystery.
It's not in the text.
We're not even close to 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of capital allocation which will be mobilised by the State and provided to Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", the explanatory memorandum states.
At the GP, we don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (both taxes), we can cover the studies for three years and then enter the 4 billion afterwards", it is explained.
"It will be in the budget and drawn up as it goes".
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This scheme, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the absent subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat heated parliamentary debate.
First public hearing on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and spies on the run
The WikiLeaks case is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal which appears as scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's go in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file made up by a secret service (of any nation) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" US revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are just a report of what could have been read in any newspaper (except Berlusconi's own) for months, and Gaddafi's ominously caricatured profile has long been a sketch for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of new information already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric literature, you will find that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the earlier works.
Not only is the author of occult texts uninterested in new research - or uncertain where to look for information about the non-existent - but those who engage in occultism believe only what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same goes for the classified files.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited-minded) head of the secret service (otherwise he could be, I don't know, editor at Liberation), who only holds as true what he recognizes.
The top-secret information on Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
Then why have the revelations on these files made such a fuss?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can telephone each other or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have become centres of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy that they pretend to ignore it.
However, to repeat it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal is not so much a crisis for the victims as for the "executioners".
But let's get to the deep nature of what happened.
In the old days, in Orwell's time, you could think of any power as a Big Brother that controlled every move of its subjects.
Orwellian prophecy had been completely fulfilled since, by being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we show, as is happening now, that even the crypts of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control ratio ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold up?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that knowing anything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is effectively an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all her power.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, governments will no longer be able to put any confidential information online - it would be like posting it on a street corner poster.
But it is equally obvious that with today's technology, it is futile to hope to maintain confidential communications by telephone.
Nothing easier than finding out if and when a head of state flew around and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and private relations be maintained in the future?
I know that my prediction is now science fiction and therefore romantic, but I am forced to imagine government agents traveling in stealth in uncontrolled coaches, carrying only memorized messages or, at best, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab fashion, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionised communications, the Internet brought back the wire telegraph.
The video cassettes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now the CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
High-speed trains take three hours to get from Rome to Milan, whereas flights, including travel, take three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that politics and communication techniques are now linked to chariots on horseback.
One last thing.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now it's the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is dodging its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the progress made by developed countries in delivering on their promises of rapid start financing.
And the big French mischief is revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU played a big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a major side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciated and appreciated for its value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had allocated €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be 'new and additional', in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, each person chooses the reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, has taken 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained and it is adding 150 million over three years under the Fast Start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the overall level of ODA.
In practice, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), and it claims to be respecting its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses his own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 euro lent is equal to 1 euro given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions which rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro which is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro given... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted as its commitments.
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "meets" its 420 million euro commitment by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so extensively.
Germany is 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) are 100% committed.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 euro to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick.
In short, France is engaging in a double scam in its fast start financing: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action over time and, on the other, on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it is able to make it appear that it is spending €420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems that Bercy has done the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if they only lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The early financing chapter is only a small issue, relatively short-term, compared to the whole climate debate.
But it could be just one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that doesn't happen.
In any event, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with other EU countries.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the question of 'additionality' or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore in the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans would raise the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (formerly Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistical significance in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem being treated", bought between July and September the food normally consumed in four meals and one snack a day by a child of about ten years in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products, and 1.5 litres of water a day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
The list is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as certain carcinogens and 37 are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by several institutions, including the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our survey clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is a matter of concern", notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible and three proven carcinogenic residues and nearly 20 residues that may disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil and intended as bait for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide which is banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in the lunch, which the study detected traces of a potent insecticide that is banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread sticks and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
The water from the tap was tested for nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to microwave the meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of these "contaminant cocktails" "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The European Ecology-Green Alliance (EE-LV) has proposed, "in view of the urgency of the situation", a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables eaten in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
