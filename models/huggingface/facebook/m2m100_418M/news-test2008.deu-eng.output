Food lies European inflation
The main reason for the inflation rise in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 Eurozone countries, the rate was higher in November than expected – after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
The official forecast is only 3 percent, Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British, and Canadian banking, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced its main interest rate; according to your opinion, the falling interest rate would favor the rise in raw materials prices and the slight decline in unemployment the formation of an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below 2 percent, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the gap: inflation needs to be “absorbed” to exclude the need for further action.
In November, the inflation rate reached a record twelve-year height; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for increasing inflation in the euro area.
MATIF wheat notes have risen by 88 percent, and the rate for soya beans has also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had a significant decline in 2007.
The world market price of raw oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per phase of black gold reached almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice.
Gallup is in government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters has grown significantly until the beginning of December. for the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the consensus for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached an unprecedented thickness of 13 percent.
The difference is clear among the party faithful voters thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entrance barrier: they reach 2% of the total population.
The number of voters in both camps has increased by one percent.
Compared to the last depth, the overall economic mood has worsened further – never before the proportion of those who consider the country’s economic situation as “extremely bad” was so high (41 percent), while the remaining 46 percent considered it “extremely bad”.
After hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth expects a improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents – a historic high – assessed the prime minister’s work as “every bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in general in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% disbelief against the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of those who think that one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister in control even without government change.
After the unrest last October, 35% voted for the remaining government and the head of government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would "probably" give their vote.
For comparison: if the parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "with certainty", another 15% consider their participation "probable."
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% would vote against the hospital fees.
Converted to the group of “with safety” voters, the share of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, and 89 percent.
Also, the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area have alsoined the average price rise of 16% from last year this year, with the difference that there was no VAT rise this year.
Posts from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Trade Dreieck, the price of the usual Christmas crops of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, however, prices have been raised by over 1,000 HUF in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets in December last year were "defounded", the price rate has not dropped drastically, compared to the high, previous output level.
However, it affects the consumers disappointingly that what they had paid far below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeds the magical 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the researched markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was at 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost at the previous year’s level, but the prices for Putenbrustfilets, Nuss and Mohn have increased significantly.
The prices for flour and bread correspond to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg bread wheels for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price break in the product at below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liters Coca-Cola pudding bottle of below 200 forints, so the drink including pudding cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" commodity comparison, Auchan cut the most expensive, and Cora cut the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora’s prices in the “Napi” shopping cart have increased by 15 percent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between last year’s cheapest and today’s most expensive basket was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest basket and current year’s most expensive basket was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price rise last year was still at 1,206,00 forint, but the VAT rise was noticeable at the prices last Christmas.
It is exactly this process that harshed the trade: it seems that the merchants were not able to decide exactly what price breaks they should apply to the individual items, as the effects of the price rise on consumer behavior were unexpected.
(If the dealer is poorly planning the circulation speed of a product, he may fall for substantial profits in the price gap that is based on the traffic intensity.)
Due to the value added tax, the price of the "Napi" basket last year fell so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference at the cheapest basket was just 844 Forint.
This year such extreme were not observed, as the most expensive curb cost about 1.630,00 forint more than the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price rise of 1.284,00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price rise, the price of daily consumer items in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office determined a pricing of more than 30 percent over a 12-month period.
In addition to meat and eggs.
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the already last year expensive product, even in the worst case, has not risen by more than 10 percent.
Obviously, multiple suppliers are in a stronger position than the freezing suppliers - after all, they were able to overcome the drastic price rise to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three shops no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all large amounts, durable foods go into palettes over the loading table.
On Wednesday morning in the morning there were endless serpents at the box in all three shops, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is by the country, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned sales, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
There are many places where disinfectants are saved.
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to an incorrect treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overload of the beds, the overload of the staff - all the factors that are not precisely adequate to the prevention of infections, says the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, desinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital recently a MRSA infection was diagnosed.
The antibiotic resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation has not been performed since that time due to the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
By December 10, this year, 1094 infections triggered by multiresistant pathogens from hospitals were to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections triggered by multiresistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one-third of people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) mostly react well to antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the drugs are overdosed or incorrectly applied, the well-responsive bacteria are antibiotic resistant, which rapidly spread in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poor functioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital’s daily life.
You should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, said Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is only not there where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, the care staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment,” says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are delivered to the hospital, although the patients are examined for MRSA, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Examples are rarely
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the inhibition of the formation or spread of the multi-resistant stimulant, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and hospitals, the hospitals should examine the hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not practiced so often.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation from the state health care bank.
The majority of cases therefore come to the daylight only when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, the medical director of the Epidemiology Center said.
According to the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies are intended to be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the drug can be formed, but this directive will not always be followed by hospitals.
Among the ambulances, or patients in primary care, microbiological samples are even more rare, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Saving on the Desinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to the other by nursing staff.
This is why handwashing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted through tuberculosis or contact, but in local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often even overfilled, the beds close to one another, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further points out, unfortunately, in the financially less well-placed hospitals it even happens that desinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that just favour the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be much less common there, or the further spread of the trigger can be stopped where these protective measures are followed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government Programs Against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in control causes the health insurance huge costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its deterioration, was recorded in the government program.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of multiresistant stimuli (including MRSA) as one of its priorities, as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals.
Police officer was not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district with a deadly outcome, the official opinion is now available.
The now rescued police chief of the XXII district, who on Tuesday killed a pedestrian in a car accident, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat on the drive.
The former police chief, with his own car in the XXII district, entered Kossuth Lajos Street and passed over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked place.
(Laut StVO is this, however, not a milder circumstance - the driver, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebrastreifen, has a retardation.)
The pedestrian has felt his injury after he was delivered to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Budapest has launched its investigation into the incident.
Moreover, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief has cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Further €400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Deputy Chairman of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit agreements of a total value of EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a 300 million EUR framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contractual partners have signed an agreement of over EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programs at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the metro line 4 also came to speech.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original treaty and any amendments will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rates are EURIBOR-binded, the loan is provided by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, free of provisions.
Bulgaria, the European Union’s real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous – all Europe is looking at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is buying on the still cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly getting more expensive?
The Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now undoubtedly the most sought for real estate sales in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic cities of Sozopol and Nessebar the runners, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to the estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country’s domestic sector will soon or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely affordable area of Russia will record more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office areas offer the highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and thus, in addition to the summer and winter seasons, it also attracts tourists in the other two seasons.
Therefore, predictive investors are already buying in great style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also seek a change in their lives.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or falling houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are greatly written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyer.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday destination (Bulgaria was listed among the top Ten holiday targets of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium- and long-term value increase.
Property in the capital, however, is becoming more expensive, due to the increasing demand.
In the EU, the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual increase of 21 percent.
The rise in real estate prices far exceeds the rise in wages.
Fodor and the 6 percent of Hungary
As the Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries consult on the Bali roadmap, in which the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol ends.
There is an intense debate between industrial and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
There was also an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is intended to be managed by a 16-man committee, which is expected to be at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as listed in “Piac és Profit”.
6 percent of Hungary
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports on behalf of Hungary the EU’s efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by the 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Accord after 2012" will be successfully achieved or not.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of just 5.2 percent, while the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed to a minus of 8 percent.
The provision for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a provision that the country will fully meet, as it is read in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would surely enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international, Nobel Peace Prize awarded UN Scientific Climate Change Committee in its latest report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the rise of Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Shows on YouTube
British army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
For the first time, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have since March 2006 uploaded videos of the operations against the Taliban, the BBC reports.
The captures with helmeted miniature cameras are controlled at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Defence Ministry was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operations in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos aimed at recruiting soldiers, and as the Defense Ministry says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such publicated propaganda is almost free compared to traditional television advertisements, Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message as they confirm the legitimacy of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertising with Game
But the army must also fight against amateur recordings that, in addition to the carefully processed, censored recordings, it also creates into the network – such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in somewhat heuchleric, “official” propaganda films, the losses are mostly spoken, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of course, from the war sites in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this “gath” for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise the slightly different way, namely with the free-download shooting game "American Army", in which the player can throw into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less vivid simulation.
Christmas celebrations with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth is in no way impatient: Instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a work conference where her employees will be able to make the year 2007 with coffee and pogats.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others magic Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or insults into the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas Fever has already captured the offices.
The greatest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held today in the defence resorts, but the ministry staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas of the Orphan" children are gifted by falling soldiers, at the "Mission Feast" family members are presented by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resource provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resources, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport proposes the lines.
The 4.32 million forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint expensive Christmas party on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festive dinner.
The room amounted to 1 million forints, the rest was spent for the more than 400 charged guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas party, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the Lustplay Theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent.
Why the dress?
The OIT building was open not only to the visitors of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the rooms.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] they said: There was no ball clothing or clothing obligation in the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government prepare each for puritanic celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to a conference on the yearly sound.
It is estimated to have about 180 guests, which - according to the press department - will be served only with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration will go out with 350,000 forints.
The self-government minister Gordon Bajnai will, with his colleagues, just attack in the ministry’s hall.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own holiday hall, with 436 employees expected to attend.
The expenditure was measured with 2500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet receipt with subsequent deposit.
Since the beginning of János Veres’ term, the PM’s employees are celebrating this way each year.
However, there will be no proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites to a new year reception on 20 January, this time the Ministry’s Christmas celebration ends.
The hundred guests are invited to the castle of Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort, the expenditure is measured by 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple receipt, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally start with a short speech from the minister and sound with a restraining smell.
As the corresponding press stations report on [origo] request, there will not be a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information was given at the press department of the Ministry of Environment.
At least, more than 400 guests were charged to the celebration, which will be held at the Art Business Museum.
More and more forces mobilize for mass strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee for the unlimited strike that begins on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest meeting will be held, and on Monday, on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act, the dismissal of work begins.
It is expected to have strike-related, significant traffic obstacles as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and also the Budapest public transport operations (BKV) strike until 13:00.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
There is also a LIGA-MOSZ strike committee that is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all the organizations that have joined the strike will set up the work for unlimited time unless any agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council fails to adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, when the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet to consult on the further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will come to vote on the health insurance law only in the late evening or until midnight.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to face significant traffic obstacles: Railways put their work off for unlimited time, the majority of public transportation is still on the morning and more than half of Volán companies are still.
At the same time, there will be many highway blocks in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations – the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations have announced strikes for unlimited time, while others are planning a temporary dismissal.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although just on Christmas holidays more and more people are on the train.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be interrupted from the start until 13 p.m., at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m. early, the LIGA power and thermal energy trade unions will postpone the work for four hours, and the teaching trade unions tbsp. the Democratic teaching trade unions have called for 2 or 2 or 8 hours of strike.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors is striking throughout the country at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for the Cooperation of Trade Unions, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government takes back the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be applicable from the next year.
The requirement number three is that the applicable professional groups will be allowed to access the early pension system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, which was submitted by the Ministry of Transport has not accepted the offer concerning the side lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to Political Capital’s Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the “Better Hungary Movement”, have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute’s “Risk Warning Report” states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk represents the “aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Zigeun and the non-Zigeun population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term.”
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely aimed at provoking such a dispute, the research institution said.
As, this is seen as a disappointment by the political leaders: “People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups, who now have built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian counterpart.”
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institution also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the sides of domestic and foreign media, “significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the confidence in stability and democratic maturity.”
We remember that since autumn 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously rebuilding, so since summer 2007 several organizations called “national self-defense association” have been established.
“These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly praise to prepare their members for – sometimes armed – defence tasks (catastrophic protection, country defence, order protection), referring to the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself,” he said.
And further: all this is done according to the method that tries to shape various political efforts, based on the political and party degradation of the population, as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association, therefore, does not serve merely to overcome the legal obstacles that may arise during the process of registration in court – it is at the same time a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are an increasing risk factor for the relations with the neighbouring countries.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the formation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, thus the political risk for the entire region has grown.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the extreme-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass evacuations that took place in a city district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the organization's goal is "national protection".
Their opinion is that in the last 17 years a fair "Zigeun terror" has been perceived in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - said Political Capital.
And further: the initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also proven by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to exclude that the Hungarian Roma also, by organizing their own protection, respond to the threats, it is said in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the news office’s request: Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and if risk-changing trends were noticeable, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Feasts are not everywhere.
In Hungary holidays are lawfully regulated, so the practice of redistributing working days around holidays has already established itself, but the next year will give us less such days.
Also in the EU and in the United States, something different is understood as "feasts".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and unemployment days.
Workless days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are unemployment days - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
We have a total of 14 holidays throughout the year.
The national celebrations are the 15th March commemorating the Revolution of 1848 and the 23th October commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the state foundation is celebrated, on 1 May the work is celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each on Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall into a weekend, the practice of "work day dismissal" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the prolonged weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturday before it, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holidays, is intended to be finally processed, has been determined by the Minister of Labour in its own regulations for many years.
The legislation applies to all employers and recipients, public employees and public service officials equally.
Except only companies and institutions where the operation is continued without interruption, also on holidays.
Today, the working order is only somewhat disturbed by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, the life in this country remains formal, as most take the time balance for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the vacation specially paid for it.
In the next year, more holidays will fall to the middle of the week or to the end of the week, so there will be fewer displays in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first put on the head around the day of work, so that people can stay at home equally for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so Friday, May 2 can be a day of rest.
The second disclosure depends on the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work out in advance on Friday, 24 October.
The end of the year, however, will be unrestless in the sign of holidays, after 24 December everything is and remains, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, language messages we never receive – harmless lies that we don’t notice any more: they bring “colour” to the everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether you get used to these little discomforts, or if you better face the challenge and try to consciously avoid these misunderstandings, for other annoying situations.
The tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone has called from the marketing department," a colleague says.
That a meeting was missed.
In the best case, you’ll regret it and try to improve it again by calling the marketing department and humbly acknowledging that you’ve forgotten to arrange the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is with an excuse.
Before you get into angry excuses, you should consider how to make your colleagues really unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Do you borrow something that is not your own?
There is nothing more nervous than getting into a document, office accessory, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the header was still on the desk – is it gone this morning?
Or is the lost believed ball writer discovered on the desk of a colleague?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are fairly angry when they find that something has gone away.
So, don’t put cover or post-it from the office into the pocket, because it could hit yourself: no more there if you need it urgently.
About the private life of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a trap that has already been placed in the world.
Who with whom, what did you do?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be linked to everyone if possible!
And if someone opens up and discloses to us his inner secret, we should not abuse that confidence!
It is best to keep silence like a grave, rather than to arrange those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
No reason to be sick?
When you call in the office to report yourself sick by calling on tortuous headaches because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, uninterrupted achievements, projects with fixed dates, the colleagues now have to do instead of one.
Do not play bad with your colleagues.
If you already know the day before that you won’t get it to the office the next day, or that something could come between, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will face the absence unexpectedly.
Total, Gekicher, Telephone
You’re just deepened in your work, but suddenly you’re troubled by the voice of your colleagues?
Do you have a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not nerve the colleagues with summaries, singing, loud conversations (which you lead through their heads), drill, constant scratching or nerve.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important news, you should not look for the fault of your own forgotteness from others!
If possible, you should not excuse yourself for the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes, and apologize if others have been affected by it too!
The question of how to recover the mistake, or how to recover the missed, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training shoes and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but has nothing lost in the office!
Not even then should you dress so hard if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don’t be too sliding – you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress yourself in the office accordingly – if desired, also beautiful and elegant!
Want to do it right to everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning stop.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a puppy, accompanied by electronic effects.
I turn the noise higher.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female chorus.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The domestic music scene has long not just overwhelmed us with quality electropop.
But now you can even see the trap different when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the indigenous digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall image, and even when the garage rock with its guitar kitch is "in" again, the indigenous electropop proves: There is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musiced himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - because a housing does not tolerate two pipes - began to move his own way.
But the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, he only succeeded when the request to compose the soundtrack into a film had reached him (e.g.
“Sezon” by Ferenc Török.
The formation, which initially took place in smaller clubs, became known to the wider public only when the magazine "wan2" raised its first album from 2002 among the top 50 indigenous albums, and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, raised to the almost one, even in the West marketable trendsetter.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were “trendy,” but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on a journey with another band.
The airful, flying appeal would be well, but in addition to the etheric character of music, the – the spirit of time and the trends corresponding – louder guitar, the influences of the rock’n’roll fall on.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle" presented himself at the premiere in the Millenaire.
A song from the album has even succeeded in the radioschlager - Mr2 Petőfi, who has since recently sent pop music from early to late, has successively put the ear wreck to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the collaboration of six indigenous singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is OK (?).
The hg.hu asked at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: In how far your music remains reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term “layer music” doesn’t mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or Underground music can be smooth and non-sagant, but it can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motivation.
The listener’s reception will also work according to this principle, independent of languages and country borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
In the abroad, especially in the west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only teenagers or twins go to concerts, but also the elderly audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentive because they also consider them a part of contemporary culture.
Q: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many people hear your music?
B: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more people come to our concerts.
We never composed for the market.
In us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly perceived in the concerts where there is already mutual interaction, but they exist only in the irreversible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: If you want to do it right to everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is traveling as a solist and has built his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, even unlike the fact that we’re constantly trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves rather as a team player who rely on the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and made a different way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, “Wings of Love” is in the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously scored with a slightly more popular style towards a broader audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the soundorgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
Q: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just you, what was the lead principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like chorus.
Then the idea came to compile the chorus from talented solists of the domestic music scene.
This is how the six-floor chorus has emerged – that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – which we then baptized “Underground Divas”.
Q: Would you like to have the same song, or did the girls share it?
For example, the number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something."
The record sequence formally demanded a singing voice.
I wrote the song in the same night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on track and scary spontaneously.
I can remember that I was quite electric at that time, but it had already needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There’s no solo party (except the short solo of Judy Jay), they don’t have their own role, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not just accompanied by the music.
They also stood behind on the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs: That they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not consciously want to give them solo roles.
In the number it is also about to forget your ego a little, to forget who came from where and where it is on the way, let’s just allow us to take these certain wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song emerged.
Q: What was the most famous song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creation work, there was actually no one, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove didn't want to work longer, but gradually everything got together, as in a puzzle.
Q: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B.Zs.: That’s changing with the concerts on a row and even now that I’ve missed the album.
Currently they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risks billions due to low quality feelings
Landless scammers
This is how his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, calls the French banking company Société Générale, the owner of the Comerční banka.
That’s why it earned almost 5 billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same with his colleagues, in addition he was not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
“He’s mentally rather weak,” he was heard from the mouth of his bosses who showed him to the police.
But as Kerviel shows from the statements published by the French media, for example the Le Monde newspaper, he was a man who had achieved profits of 1.6 billion euros with his shops at the end of last year.
Not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just in the U.S. crisis.
He had already hoped for the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already the first news that so-called Sub-Prime mortgages, such as the low-income customers or those who had previously payments problems, would be in trouble.
This crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and was right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits to €1.6 billion.
“When I earned the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to explain that,” Kerviel adds and continues saying that he definitely had nothing to keep for himself.
During the entire interrogation, he acknowledges that he has falsified documents so that you don’t get to him.
He even managed to lead his chefs behind the light, even though gradually the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to give up?
Very hardly.
“I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned $1.6 billion for the bank.”
How did he get the courage to take so much risk?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“From my first conversation in 2005 I knew that they were watching me.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told the investigation officials.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With the Alliance’s shares he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we will let you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the chefs allegedly knew everything, or knew it.
“As long as I make money, you close your eyes.”
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In a single day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compare it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they come to him?
He suspected of taking a vacation.
“I took only four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want you to look at him in the maps,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, through which the Czech Republic could reach 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007-2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion crowns from the “Enterprise and Innovation” program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest development program and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90,8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme aims to serve entrepreneurs and companies to earn funds for innovative enterprises.
Thus, companies will gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
With the previous acquisition of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful countries to date among the new members.
Nicaragua court confirms 20 years imprisonment for former president
An appeal court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud in the amount of $100 million (about $1.8 billion).
But later he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolitan.
Whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state will come back behind the gitter, according to the news agency AP is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to let Alemán sit his sentence at home or whether he must go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to its relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget is through
Yes, it has succeeded.
The state budget is approved.
What is special in this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which was adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it was submitted by Minister Sobotka (from this party), and the ČSSD therefore couldn’t afford to reject it.
Unlike the vibrant debate before the vote on the suspicion request against the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The House of Representatives rated this traditionally little respected, yet very important law in peace.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
Everything rule begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is hidden by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than narrow numbers.
The state budgets, in the past social-democratic governments, were among three weaknesses that the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high percentage of expenditure required by law, which is not only the pensions, but also the social payments that the “stable” coalition of CSSD and KSČM (communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation consists in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somehow under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the municipal budget deficit.
Many citizens, in order to open out income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, other sources of investment, often unconsciously issued debt deposits, through which they exaggerated their rotathouses.
In recent years they managed to pay off these debts by massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks they had received in the train of privatization from the state.
This source has already been destroyed.
Insofar as we only stick to official and verified facts, we find that:
For a few years, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been undergoing a phase of growth, which the ČSSD is proud of without delay.
This was a unique way for their governments to improve public finances.
Instead, these governments, however, owes the state even more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have behaved much more reasonably than our Republic.
This is a huge damage that is primarily attributed to the former governments.
We belong to the countries that are the least threatened by poverty globally.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have been excessively flooded in giant scale just in the last few years.
Even though it has managed to cut off some of the unthinkable populist spending that were adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no delay in retirement age and a retirement reform in the near future, then practically any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain for him as a pure manager.
It is slightly overwhelming to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenues on pensions and social benefits.
That’s why this year’s budget can not be a revolution, but can only include the withdrawal of normal spending by obligatory exchanges.
The 2008 deficit of 70 billion crowns would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had failed to spend in the last ten years.
If we don’t want that it really happens that ruling politicians become pure administrative officials, then we have to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and taxes, desire calm in preparing further reform laws.
Only these will allow the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to tackle the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will come to the currency markets through auctions.
On these auctions, the banks sell interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion on auction, while another 24 makes it easier for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each state agree on such a coordinated action to defend or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of free-to-use capital that banks can borrow," wrote Bernard Baumohl from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group in a report for his customers.
“The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to approximately 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-service loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
“The central banks must have really been afraid of what could happen when they decided to take this action,” said ABN Amro’s chief economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and drop the U.S. economy into a recession, possibly with impacts on economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to withdraw the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used to borrow money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other money, although the U.S., Canada and UK central banks had decreased their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting to Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is supposedly the most harmful for developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the global warming issue.
The criticism now referred to the ending international UN climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not green planet", he concluded that the ecologists' debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which represents a strange mix of government representatives and such of non-government organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it’s a word fire that is only a replacement for a real solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President, presenting his book, emphasized that the topic is very important to him, and that he is therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his pleasure that his book appears in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Now interested people can read his attitude uninterruptedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate scientist, but he thought he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and also is an economist.
As the main explanation of the book, he mentioned the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are thus normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and thus do not pose a threat, and that the efforts to influence the climate development are inutile, ineffective and unacceptable.
Furthermore, he considers it as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to force for unacceptable, other unproved views, he sees it as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
At questions from the present, he repeatedly stated that he is not against “a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the ratio between effort and revenue.”
Klaus talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driving license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to replace their old driving license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driving license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the streets without valid driving license.
According to the authorities, most of them have not exchanged their driving license who do not want to drive any more.
While small locations report a strong decline in interest in flight exchange, the capital’s offices are overwhelmed with requests, and the interest in exchange is still growing this week.
The City Administration receives approximately 2,000 customers each day.
You have to stand about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 14,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving license.
The exhibition of a new driver’s license takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not make the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license are threatened with a fine from January.
The wrongdoer will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
The police may also make a warning in case of the offence.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, one can also be punished by the municipality who does not drive at all.
He could, as it was said, threaten a fine of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already urged the agencies to leave mild valts and impose a penalty of no more than 1,000 crowns.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crown fine.
The driving license is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to possess it.
It is not a identity card that everyone, a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive should give their driving license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by letter.
At the end of the year, driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers need to gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with driving licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licenses issued from 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more driving licenses.
Court reduces penalties for detectives who were associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of doing a common thing with the band of David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was judged by the Oberlandesgericht of Prague, which reduced the sentence by one or two years.
Initially, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no appeal against the present judgment, only review at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this case, but he is first sentenced to first instance judgment.
In other cases, he was sentenced to a total of 16 years.
More cannot be condemned.
A district court ruled in January 19 people guilty primarily for participation in theft, the Oberlandesgericht negotiated today the appeal of 16 of them.
The majority of the accused complained from the beginning to the accusation with the grounds that it is a constructed case.
According to the Middle-Bohemian District Court, police officers, in negotiations with Berdych criminals, provided information from police sources, covered various rape accidents and helped members of the band escape the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the beat.
The accusation is about the band’s crimes from 1999 to 2001.
Especially in the case of theft, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also in the case of officials and unauthorized weapons possession.
During the domestic searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel nuclei, a laser targets and a machine pistol.
According to the allegations, the band has enriched itself by millions of crowns due to its robbery.
Apart from 20 men in this proceedings, the courts recognized Berdych and a number of others as guilty for further theft.
More men from the Berdych district have to be charged in a different trial, more cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main trial has so far passed away by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prison and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
For the dismissal of children in a divorce clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crown compensation plus court costs.
For each mother three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 20,000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore totally uncompromising the proposal of Velebas.
“We reject such a proposal, it’s a lot too high,” Dostál said after today’s talks.
But in order to be able to make an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that made the opposite side.
We’ll see if it’s worth it at all.
But we persist on the view that it should be in the hundred thousand area for all,” Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 20,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was the opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to the opinion of professionals from the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychic damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depths.
Men suffer the stress situation better, even if they saw themselves facing accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborn.
On the other hand, women are getting worse with the consequences of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is now going on, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the abortion clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Bömisch-Murische Höhe) gave 100,000 crowns to each family as a replacement for the expenditure they had caused by the error of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are liability insurance by law.
In the event of doubt, they must access a reserve fund, only in exceptions they can request assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low damages to the affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved within the range of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polivka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, although he was the first to use the term "Walachic King", the project had in long-term work built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not over and his client will probably file appeal.
“The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polivka parasitic,” said Polivka’s lawyer after the trial.
Everyone presented himself in the words "Walachic Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is Harabiš.
“We have 10 years of work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the reason is a dispute about money.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitic in our work,” he continued.
Luxury business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993 he was crowned by actress Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not in line with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of issuing the walachic passports.
From an initially fun action a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized out, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passes and even offered its owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Harabiš used only the simple idea Polívka made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
“The popularity of Polivka has helped the project of the Hawaiian Kingdom,” the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who had been intensely devoted to him.
The cooperation of today disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crown for Polívka in Vsetín.
But since then, the disputes between Polivka and Harabiš began to rise, which grown up in the abolition "King Boleslav I was elected until the day of St. Nimmerlin."
The leadership role was then assumed by Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková as Queen's Mother.
In 2002, Polívka submitted the complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court today dismissed.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš around the throne and a half princess.
There should be a new king.
Details and a date he didn’t want to tell.
“We don’t want to match anything.
It should be something like the king's shift in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also calmly sign up,” Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Pre-parts lose
To tell the truth, I’ve never been a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much worthwhile, the quality of driving, driving and also processing could be referred to as rather under average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi with the name SW is still a bit further, and I only have to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I had to complain, for example, about the low headache on my back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the carrossery of the combi is designed so that not even two-dimensional men will suffer.
quickly on
I’m just going through the interior for a short time so that I don’t repeat too much.
This is a fairly successful design where I have objections just because of the careful middle tunnel.
Then I would welcome a little more design design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or heads.
It also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the room offer, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the carrossery here.
In the combi, the already mentioned lack of freedom of head is also eliminated.
Baggage in the baggage room
The main thing in this car is the loading room.
I have to describe it (also because of the open back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The hole rooms are equipped with stairs that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be separated and also hold heavy objects.
But let’s talk about the load volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a fairly average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we see that the Peugeot remains around a noticeable 52 liters back.
For a vacation abroad or when ordering a child's car, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat charging room or even the very low charging section after the back seat is turned around.
120 pcs in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzin engine with a volume of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this should look like a 1600 Kubik engine that drives a family hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and goes well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes feels as if his output is stuck with a lap, then I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not popular.
But we need to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still ongoing.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car offers an additional $80,000 to book again.
However, we had copfairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc switching resolution, electric window heads on the back and...
The cost of the car is 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you’ll come at a very similar amount.
It remains the only decision which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which triggers local fears about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europe is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even detect cases where conflicts between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing of violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the disputes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, scams, and rapes among students have translated into the relationships between the parents.
The situation has evolved so far that the police in Chatham have arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with a iron stick.
The accused defended himself by the fact that the boy insulted her with racist accusations.
Police were also forced to interfere after a two-year-old girl attack on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist comments to the man and shot him with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spotted on us.
When I told him he had to stop, he wiped us with apples and pearls and then throwed out his shell," a mother of a Slovak student told The Times another unpleasant incident.
The complaints come from both sides.
One of the inhabitants called the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe even a survival struggle.
The above cases testify that the mood between indigenous and immigrants in British schools is increasingly stressed.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been to come here in search of work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will meet if you only choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a tail.
Palms and All Inclusive with cells offering pizza, ice cream and intriguing cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find that in overwhelming scale.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spanish had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Building it allowed one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was pleased to be seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew, over the wide boulevards car runs, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his hunt.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autogram.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional, you can mix cocktails as you want.
And the cult cars of the fifth century runs around in Havana until today, because the former imported shigulis and fiats have long been broken down in the salt and moist air.
Mag Havana, especially its oldest part, has been strongly dropped, nonewhere in the surroundings can you find so many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are currently being exploded, for example Trinidad.
With regard to the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the Holguín province and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar tube from distant plantings brought steam and diesel-driven smaller trails to the sugar factories.
Their car park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see dirty and fully functioning locomotives whose elderly colleagues have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Goals of Excursion
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors to Cuba.
Therefore, there is no need to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
It remains to mention that in the already mentioned property of Hemingways there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The flush vegetation grows on the calcium floor.
The Mogotas, hills and rocks, steadily rise up from the valley floor, in their hole rooms, fruitful soil was gathered, through which also rocky rocks are covered by dense fertilizer.
This valley is where the probably best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him if you visit one of the cigarette factories in Havana.
It may also appear interesting to some that there was the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman".
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her to the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the jewelry beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road to connect the area with the rest of the country in the fifty years of the last century.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained ignored.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was destroyed, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the surrounding area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of Sugar Factory".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not silence until the morning.
by Baracoa
This town in the east of Cuba, some call it the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this view will also be influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and scattered mountains and go through a landscape that is hardly touched by human interventions.
This eastern prefecture of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its untouched nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you see the cross of Columbus (in reality it is about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several table mountains to be seen, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigarettes, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pork and the island Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabinet, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, all of this could be written many pages.
As you say, it is better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
NATO, according to Defense Minister Robert Gates, should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not go according to their ideas, and in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban side, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Defense Minister Robert Gates, encourages NATO units to more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensification of development assistance.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start even a development of the economy and security,” Britain’s defense minister Des Browne told BBC.
Nine percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels, according to the U.S. military, has reached the highest level in five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, the allies, however, have reached an absolute border with regard to the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call on additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can them,” Gates said.
This is the case with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop.
“I’m not happy with what we have in Afghanistan to land and air.
We have about nine percent of the soldiers and equipment we needed, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters on the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Over the past few months there has been a dispute between the countries involved about whether all the allies in Afghanistan will do their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as faulpelze.
“Afghanish non-story disguised: the Germans make games while our boys fight,” the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German photo newspaper went to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby battle in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
Each Czech has a state debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion horses this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they resulted in an increase of 40.2 billion.
Since June, it has fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state had more than 111 billion crowns in debt.
Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we are likely to exceed the border of a billion crown only in 2009.
The next year the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.
The analyst of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, said: “We could have exceeded a billion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget that we don’t know yet.
If it should show that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he noted.
Debt Grows
The state debt comes from the government’s debt and comes primarily from the recovery of the deficits of the state budget.
State debt is funded by treasury instruments, state debt deposits, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds of the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt increased this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and dropped by 13.7 billion since June.
The average debt rate increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how good the economy is.
It is interesting that the growth is in debt deposits, where the growth is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt rises, but on the other hand, this shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of government debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the maximum funds planned for the consolidation agency amounted to 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion reserve for paying the pensions, the financing of state debt deposits for 43 billion and interest rates for the bonds at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a Teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartum on Thursday night.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy bear the name of Muhammad, although any representation of the Islamic Prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be cut off.
After the parents of students had repeatedly complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School in Khartum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam according to article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this issue takes its start in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the Classenteddy.
“The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the photo signature 'My Name is Mohammed'.
The bear itself did not wear a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic Prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said he knew them well, and she had never done anything that could make them too close to a religious belief, “I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” he thought it was just a “unwilling mistake.”
A opinion that many students share with the teacher, who describe her as “very attentive to her students” and as “the person who never talks about religion in the classroom.”
The name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different ways of writing in English.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the Prophet (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last meeting on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming their controversies on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties could not reach any agreement on the status,” said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
“There are no violent attacks expected in the near future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time,” he added, adding that there are clear tensions.
End of the negotiations on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation session since the Troika last August had received an order from the UN for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation order to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo’s independence approval at the Security Council, are supposed to continue negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains a spokesman for a negotiated solution, a unanimous solution,” Botsane-Kharchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the UN administration for eight years, the Western countries keep independence under EU supervision as the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to announce these unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favour.
Belgrade has a stronger autonomy
“There was no agreement to be reached,” said the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where these “debates of the last chance” have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and the future prime minister of the province shared his regrets.
But he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade for autonomy belongs to “a past that has led to murders and deportations.”
The domino effect.
For his part, Serbian President Boris Tradic was the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it especially fears a “domino effect” in a region that is still so much weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible,” he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision will be made solely and solely in the Security Council where its Russian allies have a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
“Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
At the journalists, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status,” and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the part of the Albanian speaking population will be “in vote” with the Western countries.
Bush claims agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians would finally agree on a joint statement.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final solution to the 60 year old disputes between their two peoples.
In the midst of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments with regard to the “Peace Plan” which they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian ministry under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to clarify all open questions without exception, including the central issues.
This name covers the three serious problems that the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolves: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were displaced from their hometown, which is in the present state of Israel, during the 1948 conflict.
According to the U.S. President, Abbas took the word and insisted that the upcoming negotiations will be conducted “comprehensive and thorough” and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
As Olmert took the word, he agreed that the upcoming cessation negotiations will be conducted “directly and without interruption” and that he will endeavour that they may be terminated by the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his “Vision of Two States”, a Palestinian and a Israeli, which are next to each other, to the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received a warranty from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries to the way that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories that were occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a gap in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” the Saudi-Arab prince said in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arab-speaking daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are faced.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Disciplinary Audit of the Police (IGPN), a police car on the Louise-Michel Street in direction of Villiers-le-Bel drove on Sunday, shortly after 17 p.m.
“He had no action, but was on track, and was driving with 40-50 km/h, without blue light,” a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, “without permission, therefore not released for public road traffic” (see below), came, controlled by two teenagers without helmet, “with very high speed” attacked.
“It crashed on the left side of the police car after it had ignored its advance from the right,” a police officer continued.
Alcohol controls on passengers are very negative.
The condition of the wagon (depleted coat flakes, split wind protective dishes, depleted stumbling) testifies to the hardness of the blow.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she has entrusted the IGPN an investigation on the “facts of involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger” in accordance with the Val-d’Oise’s Main Public Security Directorate.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor declared that it excludes the police responsibility of investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses who were heard on Sunday night have confirmed the police’s version, namely that this small force trail has reached their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of rally, caused by the trembling of the foot roads on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were hidden together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been captured and will be subject to technical examination.
The names of the two victims were obducted yesterday.
What happened after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly turned around, which resulted in the police would have left the place of the accident very quickly, and that without providing assistance to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude “every serious mistake” in this matter.
According to a police source, “this is a difficult aspect of the investigations, for which further investigations are needed, and in which one must be very careful.”
Libération hit an eye witness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
“We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her again,” this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer hanging.
Two others tried to rescue one of the young people, the fourth called.
Given the tension that had rapidly formed about the event and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the persons present had about the unexpected situation of the youth, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the place of the accident.
Still, according to this witness, the rescue forces met “approximately twenty minutes after the police departed”.
They have also applied heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police had not provided any help to the youth.
First aid was provided to these young people.
The firefighter arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor emphasized.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police launched the first demonstrations since two days ago General Musharraf called the emergency state.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the emergency measures were injured by the drilling gas grenades that the police deployed there.
They then threw the stones with which they wounded the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several were temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court’s lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrestations of oppositionists, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations were found in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (North East).
The lawyer movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers and waste to the judges who spoke against the emergency.
The promises of Musharraf are no longer valid.
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legitimacy of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election session on 6 October.
The Chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and dismissed.
“All that we represent is illegal, anticonstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promises to deliver the command over the army and to become a civil president "no longer" since the call of the emergency state, said on Monday the Vice-Ministry of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform until the 15th of November, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Vice-Ministry of Information also confirmed that the elections could be postponed by January.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the rumors in the country that the President Musharraf had been granted a place of residence from his deputy military leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which permitted contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has yet enabled a better ‘fertility control’.
At least eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
With one of five couples even on the month accurately calculated, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A wealthy departure that, due to its duration, the distance of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools “basted” by the astronauts to carry out the repair, has reached several records.
The problem arose on Wednesday when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery spacecraft, a large cylinder-shaped part that would soon take over the European and Japanese scientific labs.
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second mission of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5 tons heavy module for power generation over solar collectors, which was already on the ISS, to bring it to its final position.
After placing it, the crew went on to restructuring the solar collectors of the module, whose voltage range is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be opened like acordeons, was damaged by a connected cable at a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector anymore.
The astronauts who originally had to leave the Space Shuttle Discovery for a control course and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the spacecraft to which the station was placed to carry out the repairs.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Great, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was then chosen to operate the ‘letten’ solar collector.
After closely examining the damage, he separated the defective cable and fixed a kind of line on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker who stayed near the slope, and by the inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, commandant of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey shooter, rotated with a isolator to prevent an electrical blow on the solar collectors that produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station thought and “basted”.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully opened before he counted out his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts a half-day relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery spacecraft to plan to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the Air and Defense Group announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to counter the remains of the A400M, the stock EADS currently shows a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 referring to the remains caused by the slowly advancing development of the A400M engine, which delayed the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft are between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion for Airbus, the European manufacturer's parent group EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 on Thursday, when presenting its quarter-year results, he added without further details.
The group also says that the estimation of the new costs is associated with the six-month remains.
To remember, the business performance of the EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the masses of Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very distorted election campaign, she confirms her aspiration to stability, even to authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a public broadcast message to the voters, which has already been recorded, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does this in his status as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which a overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when he received the foreign ambassadors, the president did not see anything, and was pleased to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference – his favorite topic during the election campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud,” he added.
From the opposition’s point of view, they disappeared.
It is an oppression-filled election campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former world champion of chess, Garry Kasparovder, was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer continuing to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus.
After these unspanned parliamentary elections, two much further questions arise:
Who will follow Putin as president?
The official newspaper today announced the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin could not participate for a third mandate in a row.
Now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
The President of Parliamentary Majesty and the All-Powered Party of the United Russia, which will be elected by the Government and President?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That is tradition.
“The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Soviet, they are not the master of their fate,” said Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further back: the bourgeois society has evolved very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries to Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, Putin has again attached to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the people, even more, since this new paternalism followed no terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “abdicate” from free to the personal responsibility they put on shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
What to think for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status quo: 65 governors (from 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local voters of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
The conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor, is: “Why do we still have a long time to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they dissolve?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now free to access.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a “humanitarian” intention, i.e. individually and namely, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The 11 governments, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Heavy information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable investigations to be carried out, “especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inhabitants of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers,” explains Reto Masters, the head of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to make these named documents available to the public due to the weak nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of persons in the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who were deported or subjected to forced work, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to set them the way to their compensation.
Until today, more than 300 fixed employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, some of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
“There is nothing fundamental to expect in these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
In 2008, India and the EU agreed to reach a free trade agreement.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India’s main trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, announced that the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the ninth trade partner of the EU.
"A free trade treaty will make the two economic spaces great progress and India will improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
The Asian and European giants exchange annually "goods worth 47 billion euros" and "services worth 10 billion euros", said this week Daniéle Smadja, Chairman of the Board of the European Commission in New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has "not yet exploited its potential."The EU and India meet on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chairman of the European Commission José Manuel Dura Barrosso being present.

The Bank of England recognizes the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday showed concerns about mitigating the current recurring concern about the credit terms, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual duration.
“In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be harsh at the end of the year, and to give the banks greater certainty about the way they are going to organize their liquidity positions at this time, the bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the retention period that begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks,” she said in a statement.
The bank continues to declare that in this way on December 6 at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, to the basic tax reimbursement and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE puts liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is “ready to take further measures to obtain the day by day different “ interest rates” of interbank loans with its basic interest rate.
The daily interest rate between banks was 5,829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has risen to 6.6%, a bit higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts circulated by the Bank of England have been linked with penalties that the banks had prevented from using them.
According to some rumors, boosted by the development of the pound rate contrary to the euro, many tended to sign for the amounts that were put into circulation by the European Central Bank to more favourable interest rates and with a safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review the proposals of the PS on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups of UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text created in the context of a socialist “Nice” (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated approximately ten measures that were adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of which 50 percent for employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP floating, for a transport check or for the interference of rent.
After the UMP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to partially violent exchanges between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the television contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
Parliamentary leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of their proposals as an amendment to the bill on the correction of the finances, which was reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born.
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival is expected to take place from 8 to 10 August on a 500 acres private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world’s most renowned festivals.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the UK Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production, license concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn work parallelly to offer the area a festival event in European style.
“We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debates regarding the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the people.”
C3 Presents has brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at the Grand Park Chicago after it, together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002, became the world of festival profiles.
The two events were able to generate $9.8 million and $11.8 million in GDP tax rates each in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while our festivals are more likely to take place in the urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
“The goal is, in one way or another, to mix these two concepts with each other in order to simultaneously transmit the impression of a rural festival on the European and a urban in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to declare the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms that "these are interesting enough to invest in such an event and take a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the reception capacity of the festival is "very large", according to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer delicious rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners at C3, who received the top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is on the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no smaller than the Terminator is opposed.
These lock trials belong to the delegated tasks.
A political “heikle mandate” because the California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, attacked the “Runaway Productions”.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the “Governator”?
“You have to be cautious, because it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Running to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the highest priority is currently making the cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, whether that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will go about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange ahead of a final year rally? disagreement among experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With about five weeks before the annual bill on the stock exchange, investors are already throwing their hands with regard to the upcoming final year rally.
However, the experts cannot make certain forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. especially not when serious to take tensions determine the current market event
Although other experts do not accept such a strong rate rise in the last weeks of the year, they still notice that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. these invest mainly in pensions due to the lack of secure stock funds, which are severely affected by the emerging trend towards profitable assets.
Consequently, according to these experts, the stock exchange is more likely to have a rather lateral short trend, influenced by market fluctuations, “especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the potential fall of the U.S. bank’s interest rate, an uncertainty that is due primarily to the rise of the oil price and the risk of the rise of the inflation rate.”
Javier Barrio, the chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is time to announce a upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8 at 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully finish the year with 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, annually subsidized pension funds at this time.
However, the expert emphasizes that this year the things could develop a little differently, especially due to the last year rally that took place already in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analysts, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a almost technical level, which could lead to the fact that soon a deviation from the index values, the scale of which depends on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis, could occur.
The analyst is confident that these results are positive.
When choosing the values to advance the Ibex to new maximum levels, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney says that this year the big values are on track.
Among the value-winners the expert would count the two large banks and some real estate companies, "because the electricity sector will be too expensive at a given time."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from the Bank Inversis assures that the growth will be accompanied in connection with the banking and industrial sector.
If the rally actually takes place, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
“The ACS has been on a recovery rate in the past months and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will take the same way,” the expert said.
As regards increased consumer behavior during Christmas days, in the last half of the year, periodic consumption will determine the event of the market.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also positive outcomes, even if they are represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Over the past seven years, December has only showed falling rates in two cases.
When the technology blase was placed at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final year rally.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rate rise of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has grown by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year rate, it will be revealed.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions opened 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
In total, 200 of them are settled in the most economic regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a big mileage.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first banking group represents the jump waves to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekends to 20.30h and set on Saturday from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly read the extension of its opening hours in the offices, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all shops will be closed on Saturday and opened on a week's day afternoon, if not for the customer.
Whether more banks join the new initiative, which will adapt to the opening hours, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that’s exactly the intention that popular is pursuing with their project.
The objective is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the commercial customers of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large shops.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it’s not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will transform the premises of those offices that are already in business zones, and at the same time link them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of the opening hours will be associated with a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The competent bank representative, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring does not require greater investments, but will take place with an increased staff settlement, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The offices that will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs will not sell financial products.
Positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine shops in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and the Gran Vía streets have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 offices.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them instead will offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
“We do not want to represent competition for our customers,” Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have reached a preliminary agreement to sell mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus exceeds its rival Antena 3.
We have succeeded.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the stock exchange closure. the broadcaster led by him had increased its value by twice the value of his rival Antena 3.
But one aspect dropped his joy: “This is exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had less losses,” he noted.
He emphasized that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deeply.
Telecinco ended the day with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches 4.488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52 percent), and Vocento participating only with 13 percent.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has since January to report a total loss of 40,5%, thus its market value flows by 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other stock marketed communications companies is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (the publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518,53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it’s “two similar companies,” according to Vasile.
It remains uncertain to what extent we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it profitable at the customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago its intention to rise to the first television channel this year with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenues. This was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project was implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, the net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the comparatively better exchange rate of Telecinco, analysts see, is the high payment rate that the company could have until now: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend discharge.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a mother company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
“We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have increased significantly so far.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose shares we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has a number of losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of a decrease in the expected growth rate, which will decline from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This also lowered the expected profit estimate of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5 percent and for 2009 by 7.5 percent.
Three options.

The Congress approves the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its session with the Congress decision in the Senate on the project-related add-on/modification proposals, the government published the provisions that arise from the new law, with the intention to enable the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate Members, who in their negotiations and votes pursued the goal of setting the best possible arrangement that ensures the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market event.
In addition to the modernization of the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities Services Regulation, seeks to improve the protection of investors, increase the inspection requirement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialized companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESISs) to the consulting companies associated with the investment and mediation companies of securities.
Furthermore, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circular markets will be added the multilateral systems of effect trading and the systems for the internationalization of trade orders, which will eventually compete with the current economic actors.
The law obliges investment firms to disclose the focus of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of risk management on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate CNMV their control performance.
The Economic Commission of the Congress later planned further changes, with the decision that the debt with titles must now be considered “complex” funds for the investor due to its high risk, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the work areas of graduated economists was used; 30 years after the 1977 Regulation, which restricted the work areas reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, on its part, determined new positions in the financial sector, as that of the economic mediator, working on a foreign account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and to gain customers simultaneously to several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) rose by five decades in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator, which Eurostat serves to assess the inflation rate within the European Union, provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by publishing the data, seek a local and quality comparison with U.S. products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made in advance by applying the same procedure as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time by applying various other statistical modeling methods to assess the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) noted that the indicator that was determined in advance serves only as a target value and therefore does not have to match the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level.
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November is a “temporary development” and it also assured that the price index will continue to remain at a “relatively high” level in the coming months.
However, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that “even if the current figure is not good”, the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the currency union has remained “more or less” in the past years.
He also stated that there were “less surprises” in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high rise.
“We expected a value of around 4 percent,” the Minister of Economy and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenue of over €42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s assets have decreased by more than half after the bank had requested a emergency loan from the British Bank due to a crisis in mid-September last year, and are now only £12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets reached a record 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has decreased considerably within two and a half months due to the customer’s loss of confidence and even despite the government’s hundred percent guarantee that the money is safe, it will continue to decrease until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to invest about a quarter of the British banks’ revenues that will consist there from the investments of the next three years to acquire exactly the £18 billion that will still be needed to their $30 billion goal.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his outstanding advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to flow £50,000 million (approximately €70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred provider to lead it out of the insolvency.
Mayor of Totana arrested for suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police have arrested today morning the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the town of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of dealing with urban corruption that was revealed this week.
Also, one of the council secretaries and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently deputy of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipality of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio channel Cadena SER, be the original drawer of the complot.
The officials continue to review the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrestations in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused, the main suspect in the case of urban construction corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the “popular” and consequently the privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested when he left his client’s residence due to important annoying documents intended to be related to the complot.
Furthermore, other sources report the alleged order payments of Morales to a Galician construction company that intended the conclusion of a urban construction contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares area was decided.
At the moment, eight people are in detention.
Bono says he agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in case of a election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the proposal of the President and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, according to which he will lead the list of PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in case of a election victory of the Socialists, take over the post of Congress President.
This was announced by José Blanco, the organizational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono in a press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party headquarters.
According to the head of the government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is “important in politics to be able to count on the best” and Bono “is among the best.”
In addition, the Mancha-based politician would, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, “all appears” to be a candidate for the party as the president of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had last November 15 announced that he would no longer participate in the next general elections, terminate his career in public policy and instead engage in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to acknowledge that since his resignation two years ago, the president had continually pushed his return to the political event.
He also pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economy, does not want to prevent citizens from taking over the post of Congress President in the event of a election victory, and called this a “act of transparency”.
If he actually took over the office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a “House of Respect and not of Harassment or Crisis” in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
“Continually, you get the impression from time to time that the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk calmly is Congress; so the president in the Senate has been interrupted once to 26 times.”
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his “good work” and pointed out he did not want to raise the appearance that he had already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call it “arrogant.”
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to unrighteous criticism, both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate in front of it, the movement as a whole must demonstrate a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change as more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a “new treaty with the planet”.
However, this proposal brings him in need of explanation regarding the action or non-trade of his government, which has significantly contributed to Spain being the top of the countries within the EU that have the least fulfilled the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the failure to comply with the requirements, which sectors are due to this, and why its government, which proposed the ‘Planet Treaty’, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to inform the Spanish citizens of the measures he planned against climate change without shifting.
What companies will be affected, what behavior of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective savings measures should be carried out, and what economic consequences there will be.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, there are and will not be such explanations in the future.
Especially because it is about sacrifices and payments.
The measures that can be implemented against climate change are unacceptable.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the benzin center proposed by the PSOE seemed strategically so dangerous that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Therefore, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty speech, without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, committees, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise so suitable for election campaigns politicians must not speak, accuse, or demand, but instead follow the demanding output to decorate the meetings and to encourage others with his gentle and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not suggest that the bicycle will become the only means of movement in the future, or we can only refresh ourselves with a bag.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to a alleged deployment into urban construction corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Murcia Totana, the “popular” politician José Martínez Andreo.In addition, the local police chief, the mayor's secretary and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody for alleged suspicion of urban construction violations, it said today from investigation cycles.
The city council was arrested at his place of residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in the premises of which he is so far, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the city administration and the municipal construction management “Suelo Industrial y Vivienda”.
The three arrests are linked to the findings held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it was revealed that more than 2 million hectares of unfinished building ground for urban construction projects should be rebuilt under the leadership of the Galician construction company “Nuaria”, which should build 4,000 houses on the property after the local administration had received illegal provisions during the last legislature period.
Furthermore, two other persons were not directly arrested, but undergoing an investigation procedure, which is initiated and carried out by the first Totonas court.
The first six detainees were presented to the judge today.
According to the statement of the investigation crises, it is also being investigated against the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP deputy Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a Totana registered real estate company, as well as his current girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the “Nuaria” group, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of “Suelo de Inmonuar” Pablo José M.G., whose companies operate as a “Nuaria” subsidiary group and allegedly received the smoke money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrestations, carry out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies that were directly related to the arrestations held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally-known bird crew, who was alleged to have acted as a medium man.
The construction group “Nuaria” was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the town of Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of area in Totana, which was intended to be rebuilt. the goal was the realization of a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is in the top of the PISA study), referring to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; accidentally on the day the publication of which included the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is a graduate who cited in his news the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsinki Sanomat, the head of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical attitude towards Platon and proposed to cut Platon’s teaching from the undergraduate teaching plans for the Philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which will be punished with six months of imprisonment.
However, if you again steal a music store under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the deal up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is considered a crime, but the penalty is less than the case of a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you crush a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a strike than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebel struggle leads to a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data exchange leads to a freedom sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code)
E. According to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization has not been carried out by the authors is subject to a higher punishment than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, then someone has made his demands very good.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: “Money leads to the activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it.”
So the feelings arising from the monthly wages are dependent on the wages of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, “the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his counterpart failed.”
The researchers found that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and then received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I’m not sure if it really takes so much scientific effort to such a result.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been unhappy with the Criminals of the Balkan Wars; her headquarters is at the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main officials of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosnia leader Radovan Karadzic continue to be on foot.
Their names are listed on the list by Switzerland-based director Marcel Schüpbach as a presentation for the title of his documentary "La Liste de Carla" (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that with the pace of a political thriller pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her attempt to detect the escaped criminals and put the respective governments under pressure so that they get their networks closer.
Which insurance is best for me?
The vehicle insurance that covers any possible damage caused by the driver involves a high cost, the amount of which, in turn, depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of drawing the driver’s license, family status, the type of the car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear what we have to do here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is concluded in writing by means of an insurance agreement, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding amount of withdrawal in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver’s license, family status, type of the vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so in case of a higher accident risk, higher contributions will also be required.
For this reason, both over 25 years old and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups, thanks to their caution, have a lower rate of accidents.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to statist values and therefore, according to the beliefs of companies, tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefit to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting the premium, the insurance companies need to take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also thoroughly study the situation to choose exactly the car insurance that is most likely to meet his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance so that we can make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
People under the age of 25 are confronted with numerous obstacles when choosing an affordable insurance, such as the low driving practice and the “young” driving license.
Even if it would be best to complete a full-cash insurance for an ideal insurance protection, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full casco with self-contribution, so the services of a full casco insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
“The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and according to the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher and lower than the amount to be paid,” explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the advanced insurance that ensures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused on his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here is a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it’s in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your credit rate increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the tariffs mentioned.
The amount of credit and penalties depends on the company and its revenue.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can be allowed to increase the bonus payments,” Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Therefore, it is most reasonable to choose a full cash insurance with self-contribution.
“Normally, young people can’t benefit from their past experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving,” explains the Spanish chairman of the European company, adding that the majority of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the “beginner’s fear” was dissolved.
However, it is advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete a full-cash insurance; of course only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
On the side of the insurers, spouses with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contributions are also low.
In this case, a full cash insurance with self-participation (with a amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In the case that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of the vehicle.
“They drive more relaxed in general and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment,” Luis Noguera notes.
For retirees, it is recommended to complete a full cash insurance with self-contribution (with a amount of €150) or an extended insurance that will only be used with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection that fits our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the point for the eighth final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight on Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League round.
The Italian team has already five points and has confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a disagreement in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not take the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will play at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished before all the others and the disagreement at Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the everywhere expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow knows that in case of a victory they will be the group first and thus will have a better outcome position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even have a defeat in a FC Shakhtar slope to qualify. however, he should not too much rely on such circumstances, because with nine points equality the participation is available to the Ukrainians; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second match (2-0).
The other hopes to reach the eighth final of the re-formed Champions League for the second time in a row after they were defeated in the upper season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-play time (1-0) and by a zero to zero disagreement on the match.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the "Rossoneri"'s victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eighth final and his membership in the UEFA depends on his victory and the defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could, despite his lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, win the third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In Vancouver, Canada, the Spice Girls gave the start shot in front of 20,000 spectators for their first tour after the band's dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place de Vancouver, the mood in the re-united band was 'high'.
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert in the outselling stadium, showing a video about the band's history, which in the late nineteenth century caused furor.
The reunification and the world tour intersect with the release of a new album that includes their greatest hits and two more new songs, “Headlines” and “Voodoo”, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore on the stage gold armbands that the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star “has not seen our garderobe a single time, and that’s why I’m looking forward to what he will think about the show.”
"Sporty Spice", whose withdrawal in 1998 due to internal disagreements, two years later caused the group's dissolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world audience had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought why not; so I’m glad I’ve made this decision,” Chisholm spoke about the division of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes have been eliminated and now everyone likes each other again.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
The group first arrived in a Virgin Airlines special plane in Vancouver, according to CTV.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by a soldier from a little girl.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will show in California, San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on December 23.
New Fears About Russia-Ukraine Gas Dispute
A new price dispute is ongoing between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is very closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will be charged by Russia with higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more charged, as the group agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
“It’s important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important food transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [by Western Europe] over Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a decline in exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed prices up.
Russian gas consists of a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas supplies, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own reserves with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS “must control foreign workers”
The Scottish State Health Service needs to improve the controls of the pre-criminal registers for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns about the fact that the Scottish state health service has no accurate idea of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were properly carried out at a sample of five health agencies.
The main financial controller investigated staff recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a ground car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast in Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will conduct checks before hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-criminal registers, the Agency is not competent to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the Chief Auditor now says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Board should adopt guidelines on the extract of the criminal registration, which will help employers with controls in different countries.
"Al we found evidence of these checks in some staff documents, they were not routine," the report said.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines very much before employing, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of the hiring of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report says that the NHS Scotland’s current preliminary testing works well and it’s unclear what added value the recommendations will provide,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of which are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because the directors would have trouble identifying those employees who are resettled for unlimited time.
The investigation continued to find that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were mainly followed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for inspections before the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was concerned to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in the updated guidelines regarding the control examinations would be reflected before the employment of all employees – including those from abroad – whose publication is planned for the next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.
The prizes were also awarded to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of the Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and assistant actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded the Best Actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing the British film to the world public.
The prizes were awarded at a ceremony in London’s Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis ascending to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - on which soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was directed for just 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he awarded the Dutch photographer Corbijn, most likely known for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards - as Best Director and Best Director.
Rock music was the center of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for Best Documentary Film.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing hard guy, has won the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the prize that was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened the doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my kind of man, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa fans and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist complot
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has arrested 208 militants for their belonging to cells who had planned an upcoming attack on an oil plant, as well as intellectual and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to infiltrate missiles.
Al-Qaeda’s supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to a television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-man strong rapid intervention force to protect after a misleading Al Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministry statement, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "racket expert" who illegally migrated into the country.
He that the militants had planned to infiltrate eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Further 22 of the detainees were intended to kill spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned Christians to do more to stop the Saudis seeking to go to Iraq to join Al Qaeda militias seeking to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis as ketzeric.
Al-Qaeda militias consider many Christians in Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that is dominated by the government.
The militias, accompanied by the calls of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader to target the pro-western Saudi government, have excepted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
“This was a very big effort by the security forces over the last five months,” a spokesman told state television.
The arrests also covered a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at promoting for the "Takfiri Thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, supporting violence against Muslims who are becoming the unbelievers and abstract fire market.
Among the detainees were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could give a perspective on the future of the Earth
Venus was once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on a row shows that the planet is even more similar to a distant twin of the Earth than it was known before.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and similar planets, but the Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have dominated conditions that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even be habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the most uninterrupted carbon dioxide treating effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight and a slower rotation rate, the Venus introduced a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to blend the wool and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and flash storms.
The findings of the Venus Express spacecraft by the European Space Agency, which has studied the plants for a year, provide an enriching look at how the Earth could develop in the face of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: “It will become clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets otherwise are quite similar.”
“Our new data enables us to build a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
‘Rich Uranus’ Arrested by Police
A kilogram of radioactive material, according to reports enriched with uranium, was captured yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material is being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be interrogated by a Snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency eventually declared ready to face a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions that were raised on Wednesday evening on November 28 were as ridiculous as the Snowman, who questioned the Democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the state of the Republican Party, which will break up in the next year’s elections.
It’s not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate, who selected YouTube clips to show the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest dedicated to a single topic, immigration was in the center.
This is one of the most challenging issues for the Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undefined voters to serve a scrub when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed the top of the agreement as the candidates spoke strictly over the boundaries.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who advanced in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to disrupt the reputation that he has been disgraceful about illegal immigration when he was the mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants for work in his house.
The two were especially strongly divided as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegal would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to pursue the issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but both remain in the race, because they have hunted on the immigration pauke earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates in general share the same views: sharp boundaries, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about poisonous toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics were brought to speech.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed any word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani to express the point of view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the wolf.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now opposed to all expectations in the first place in a recent Iowa survey thanks to his long existing Christian conservativism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabe's rise in Iowa falls along with Ron Paul's recent donation successes and his favour storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two have been shot up from nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the most well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a winning message about the size of America and a swing to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another grave to enter; his way out of it remains the same.
For the British scandals, this is not very scary.
No noble titles seem to be sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no out-of-the-country teeth have been blurred.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has hidden donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than £650,000 (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without that the rival Gordon Brown would have gone well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had dismissed the demand for a election, stupidly offending the intelligence of the British, claiming that opinion surveys would not have influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp-minded representative chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unfavourable rescue of Northern Rock, a bank attacked, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under shooting.
Badly thought proposals to amend the tax laws have raised corporate associations against the government.
The tax-reserved loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative puzzles.
A trio of retired generals started a rebellion in the Supreme House in protest against the cuts in military spending: to be Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labours Secretary General (and his former execution manager) has already withdrawn.
Nothing of this means that Brown irrevocably stops the direction of departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to govern.
People don’t even trust politicians, but they normally keep their scepticism back when a new army takes office.
Once it’s clear that it’s unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be there for a long time, this stop is over: the public service begins to become impaired; the cabinet ministers begin to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and targetsless.
In a way, Brown’s position is difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new beast.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his Supreme Lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax responsibility documents, for example, are related to the decisions that Brown made as the chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misfortune - like the long "Money for noble titles" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was.
However, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks.
The errors are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely accelerated.
And the countermeasure, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist trends have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new proof of political donations is a good example.
The garbosque Abraham, who compares his donations with his non-profit donations, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but the decision was not to him.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he had known about the agreement of Abraham, but not that it is illegal, will, of course, have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main financial manager, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: There is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he weted this determination by seeking a well-known instrument, a investigation committee on the subject - led to make the measure full, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the “learning from there” is not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Besides this, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life that has been unemployed for six months, and advancing with a progressive reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and eventually give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions – bitter pills for a party fellow like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can a victory is through unbeatable legality and solid competence.
Cardage
Does the credit crisis affect the American credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it’s only natural that the rectum is exciting around.
Now that America’s real estate market is crumbling, the hijackers have visited the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of infection from underfinanced loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the outputs and in the salary rates that measure the proportion of the loans, each untakeable or more than 30 days too late.
HSBC has announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion tax collection from its U.S. consumer funds, partly due to the weakness of credit card recipients.
It is too early to panic.
Losses and savings are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter soil rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historic average.
The deterioration of the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. private insolvency law in 2005 led to an abrupt fall of bankruptcy reports, which in turn account for a large part of the card losses; the number of applications (and thus payments) would rise again whether the general conditions for creditors will deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports of solid pay rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay each month.
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stop in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, expects that the amount of expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certain direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debts, now that home loans will dry out.
But the card outsellers look at the cash flow rather than on capital values, therefore falling house prices do not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of the lender.
They can even be advantageous for the card outleters.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the real estate is less worth than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the refund priorities.
Card issuers can also be much faster and more flexible than creditors to respond to more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-evaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely,” says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones’ main financial spokesman.
Even if a sudden disclosure crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable disclosure are significantly more real.
If lower household prices and a credit decrease push America into the recession, the industry will undoubtedly be faced with a more cruel future.
Continue to look at this hunt.
British banks confess guilty in Enron case
Three British banks, who were supposed to be brought to court for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, on Wednesday changed their claims to guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally claimed innocence for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set to January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior claimed everyone guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were announced in the UK during a two-year extradition process.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation that began after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations initially filed against them in 2002 made Fastow notice that he was the goal of a government investigation in connection with the Enron decline.
The accusation against the banks - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to raise a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron’s partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinery that helped break the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Koppers control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsified to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper and others had $12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow declared himself guilty of conspiracy in two accusations for his role in the Enron Pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is sentenced to six years in prison in the Federal Prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot due to a $1 million deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, collapsed in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide the billions of debt or make weakening appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than $2 billion retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is sentenced to a fine of more than 24 years.
Lays convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were failed after he died last year for heart disease.
Not all down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient reach to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is a little money for some of the rich Russians.
“It offers room for up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But no one of you asks for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was on the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption, which was held in a scattered exhibition center on the city shore of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stations, hoping to interest newly earned Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-developed yachts to diamond-developed autogrills, which would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously took a bright orange Porsche in the nearest exhibition.
"This is a nice car, but it's little money compared to us," he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second-largest market for private aircraft.
Heated by a oil tree, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money as Dallas at its glowing times.
“We’ve gone through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to giant wealth and went in shark to Europe where they were considered materialist,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab survivors of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the world’s most visible freelance investors.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold.
Otherwise in Moscow this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, possessing a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaries belong to the second class, which are worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, which was written by economic experts of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert group here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaries in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelry designer.
For the first time she visited the exhibition together with the Russian merchant of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all modeled and men are all worth a wealth.”
While they go through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaries.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a Red-Teppich veteran with Joan Rivers.
The exhibition seemed to be primarily targeted by the New Yorks, the type of brand-conscious Russian merchants who would be ready to stand in the staircase for several hours to visit an adjacent warehouse, which tastelessly placed Cadillac Escalades, Platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, customized billionaires, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at an exhibition of the Dutch porcelan manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt picture of hand-made, blue mosaic stones.
“Naturally, the Russians are more interested in Klimper climbers.”
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of smooth brands with limited pieces that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millions, millionaire messengers, or just tourists, were pushing through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, Kashmir and cotton, with injected gold roofs.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that supplies high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company sold the gray orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the chairman of L.A. Connection, a company that adjusts luxury cars to customer needs, said he had sold three car coolers for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that are equal to connected chain arms, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre designed for a Russian casino owner, with spots he had overwhelmed with colourful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette board.
The cost: $22,000 for a quarter.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to have roads or a picture of his wife’s face from a cubic circony will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” Mr. Karapetian said.
“He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage.”
Although many of his Russian customers are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian Millionaire" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise of home real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaries could at least do as if they were rich on a state operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to the British model that were filled with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the Millionaire Fair.
Passants stopped to throw the money hats around, mobile phones, while they lie down in the middle of the replacement wealth, to let them be kicked by friends, or simply to throw a few million.
“Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and observed how an ambulance on the white Cape Cod staged two doors further below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the medical body watch car coming," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
“This was the point when I knew that someone was dead.”
The authorities that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the director of the Newarker Police Association.
Now the investigators are trying to find whether she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house on the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hoping that toxocological investigations, the results of which could not be available for weeks, will help uncover a mysterious death that has sent a sadness by the head of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo has been an assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hard working and enduring,” Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my Pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a shepherd daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankov, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized, surgical treatment.
“This is one of the possibilities,” said Ms. Walsh.
“This is an ongoing investigation.”
The authorities said they had arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn’t want to tell if Mrs. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros House, where a wrapped rose tree stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian blows behind the house.
A blue façade described with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the floor.
Two mountain bicycles hang from haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that’,” he said.
“She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I went.
It was shameful.”
Expectations that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise of world stock markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market expectations that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rates, was strengthened by annoying comments from the Vice President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said that the policy must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continued pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the treasury markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulences had "partly some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October reverse."
If the increased turbulence continued, it would increase the possibility of further aggravation of the financial conditions for consumers and, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and stabilize credit conditions with new capital rates in the U.S. markets and possible further interest reductions.
The exchanges also helped to calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the U.S. economy, now as the sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence have been highlighted by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its worldwide workers, in a cost-reduction measure to compensate serious losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2,55 percent, to close at 13.289,40, while the wider S&P 500 Index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306,2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the rebound of credit pressure on the markets was highlighted after the strong demand for a three-month warranty of the European Central Bank to be awarded to the European Commercial Banks was significantly 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and take more capital into the London monetary markets increased as the credit tensions saw the three-month "Libor" lending rates rise to its highest since late September with 6.59 percent, following a continuous rise since November 21.
England faces decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, on call at least under this special title, is here to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English chief executive, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for which part-time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth hit position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to determine exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest level, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It’s not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get up for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same can be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good conclusions who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or undergo.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances have this as well.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a striker must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a single-day cricket player.
Finding the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and as the wind cuts into the networks.
Anderson took 32 top wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their brilliant points and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya stadium, it can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it may make a little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to strengthen himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion during today’s networking session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and stomach sense for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his brilliant and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years seven years younger, and an excellent balance against the targeted ball.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate refusal by the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take his position back for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his beat, which was still obvious in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Alleskönner from Essex has a life joy.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket square and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently overthrowed a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for the British sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (naturally also sponsored) and call his team colleague Alastair Cook, who had watched it from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen it?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he covers his middle pace with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit him and hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, the right time to choose another.
Per that’s the true art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah may not stand well if, as the Ceylon Teesatz suggests, he’s the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and fight Al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas have gone out, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some even came back to fight the rebels who had displaced them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transportation.
“I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunnite doctor.
“I’ve returned today because of what I’ve seen on television and what I’ve read in the newspaper about what has happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now.”
They say that the Mahdi army has ceased to kill people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of the militant clergy Moqtada Al-Sadr, who ordered his forces to resign at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominant Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he couldn’t renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraq to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local, U.S.-supported militan has helped to expel Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand-granate attack after he had invited his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He was back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my sons.
That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they have been trapped by the increasing peace in the capital since the U.S. raise of troops and the growth of local “groups affected citizens” who armed and in cooperation with the U.S. military defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home due to visa issues and money laundering in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are likely to have escaped from the sectieric death traps in the country.
“We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis not to give any more visas to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retired said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnites were displaced from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will regain sectarian tensions and conflicts will come.
Small island, good education
The smallest federal country is leading in vocational education and glowes even with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one educational field, the Saar countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
“Yesterday, for the 50th time, I declared to a non-Saar country that we are not French,” this slogan the smallest federation self-theronically poses on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the educational system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economy in Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities have traditionally worked closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
The percentage of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But even the countryside children bring the Saarland in more than an average number to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
“In Saarland, the professional education system is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their qualification in a professional school, making Saarland more than seven percent points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combination of professional and academic training are also comparatively strongly developed.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual studies is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
“In the university schools we have undergone a number of reforms after the first Pisa study,” said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has conducted national comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year is free of charge – a model that other federal countries are now copying.
Whether the students’ performance will improve sustainably will only be shown by future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the share of risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not grow as strong as other federal countries.
The Bayerns are better.
And for the depression of the Saar countries, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score.
For the language of the neighbors is obligatory at high schools – even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez puts off the clocks.
In Venezuela, the clocks will be different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez left the timetable in the South American country a half hour back.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clock will be suspended to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This makes the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the U.S. to impose the world’s division in time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the breakdown of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage case.
The left nationalist said as long as the conservative president Alvaro Uribe remains, he will not negotiate relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," Chávez said, who is pursuing a constitutional reform, which the citizens of the oil country must vote on a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Urib’s decision to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which was about the release of hostages.
Uribe has put Venezuela "in the face" with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is in all mouths.
A new phone call tone causes furor in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't keep your mouth) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the internet.
His speech was spoken by Spanish king Juan Carlos, who was angry at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant intermittent calls of the left-wing populist and was driving over his mouth.
Germany threatens 2007 salary minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are at risk of a real wage loss this year.
Experts named a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect real 2007 with less on the salary account than in the previous year.
“The fault is the modest wage development, the VAT rise and the price drops in food and energy,” said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomy and Economic Research at the “Bild” newspaper.
There could also be new burden on workers in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said to the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned decrease of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent to the annual change is right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed again to have to ask for loans or grants from the Federation, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products drove the inflation rate to the highest level in 13 years.
The prices increased by a total of 3.0 per cent compared to the year.
Venus is the Earth’s Twin
Venus, despite its enemy atmosphere, is more similar to the Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and winds in the Poland, as they occur in winter and on Earth.
For three decades, scientists have suspected that it blossoms on Venus.
Now the European "Venus Express" has given the evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus shoot at a height of approximately 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, says Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Supper Theory", flashes have created life on Earth: Storms are supposed to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the buildings of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there is hardly to be anything living: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the devil twin of the earth, but it’s a twin,” Russel said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has made such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineteenth century no one was on the way specifically to explore this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several “Nature” articles, the researchers think not only emphasize the uniqueity of Venus within the solar system.
“They also show that the communities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially thought,” the Esa said.
In addition to the already known turbulent wind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud thread on the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening stars, rotates around the Sun in about 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Venus day takes 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water was gathered, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus went lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is fixed in carbonate stones, it makes most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Kohlers Defend Merkel's Meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for the end of the party dispute on the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this matter,” Köhler told the trade newspaper.
At the same time, Köhler signed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, but Merkel has taken protection from the accusation, she is implementing a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not taken a distance from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly revealed misfortune over the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, has complained of the Union’s “looking window policy” in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office, there was intense irritation in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only charged the German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL’s information, also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China will refuse if European politicians receive the religious leader of the Tibet in official functions, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Sheuble warns of crawl as in France
Street strikes with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of crashes as in France.
Everything has to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not disappear in violence on the streets, the Federal Interior Minister called for.
Barricades burned, runners shot with scratches to the police: After the severe youth crashes in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
“We need to make sure that social explosives do not build up and disappear in violence.
We have to take it seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hannover.
Not every young man can face the rapid change in the social reality.
The federation, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to resolve problems, Schäuble said.
This does not only affect the integration of migrants.
“From the integration summits to the Islamic conference, this already shows the first success.”
However, it is too early for warning.
Sheuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in the German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had brought themselves to serious street strikes with the police last nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
More efforts to integrate the federal government demanded, however, the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the crawl in France, Kolat warned of "rehabilitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bad as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in youth with migration background under 25 years of age is "over average high".
It is essentially necessary to provide more training places.
Kolat emphasized: “We need to give the youth a perspective.”
But the Turkish community chairman added that in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families."
Many young people with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, “But we still have to be careful.”
It is necessary to “give young people the opportunity to participate in work and education quickly.”
Meanwhile, the night was largely quiet in the Parisian countryside Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with radiators.
The competent authorities three arrestations, as well as a few burning mulls and cars.
Since the previous day, an assembly of around 1,000 security forces has provided rest.
Police will go through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
Around 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night at the Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the afternoon, the unrest grew over Toulouse.
The rocks were burned in a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not guilty of the deaths of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The unrealistic appearance of the Chancellor documentes that the coalition is contently at the end – and that it is nothing more to expect from itself.
In which country does this federal chancellor live?
After her comfortless appearance in the General Debate of the Bundestag, which was worthy and contentless, one must say: not here, not in the country that should finally be governed by it.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too much focused on foreign policy with an angry overwhelming statement.
That’s provincial, she said, and showed that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented to everyone how much their accusation is valid.
There was neither a particular interest nor a feeling of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a dismissed politician who escapes into foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
Climate protection example: She praises the decisions of St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St. St.
Overall, the self-lob - so much discretion the CDU chief would have failed even two years ago.
Now she climbs to the flock that the resurrection will come to the people.
Thus, she damages her image as a pragmatic who solves problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a marginalization.
Child poverty and the worries of the poor?
He has a few subscriptions left for it.
It is indicative how often she promises when it comes to the child's attack.
Merkel needs three steps to get a half straight sentence.
It turns like on a foreign land when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney make a harsh blow to each other - and now they have to be afraid of a foreign candidate.
The tension of the candidates disappears at the first topic.
He has made New York a "residence for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney is quitting his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say his own house was a port for illegal," Giuliani opposes and calls for the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blast to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favourites, the eight presidential advocates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-directed 30-second videos submitted by Internet users via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism we have made Hitler come to power,” John McCain tells his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the Vietnam veteran strongly read the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method simulated by drowning, as torture.
But that the key issues of the campaign are now beyond Iraq war and torture discussions, the reactions of the Saal Republic in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium brings awareness.
It shows where the weaknesses of the two favourites are.
“I’ve made a mistake at that time,” Romney tightened and praised the base and the television public that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the cries when, according to his opinion, he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as the head of the army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf was promised to be president.
This ends eight years of military domination in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was appointed for another five-year term on Thursday.
The Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf promised to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as head of the army to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, causing international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in an unbeatable military coup, the former general now runs for the first time as a civil head of state.
With his resignation as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central claim is the end of the emergency state imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his commitment, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, abolish the state of emergency and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which was occupied by Musharraf after the imposition of the emergency at the beginning of November with the lawyers charged with him, had last week rejected all complaints against the controversial re-election of the president on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of northern Kazakhstan, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to a military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Returns
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventh is musicing again: The three Harmonia band members took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival appears a compilation from their great time "Live 1974".
They were much more famous abroad.
The adorned sensation then takes place in the form of three ruled lords on the evening table.
Everyone has his box, his cables, and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in a flower-white shirt, 63 years old in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed by the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone comes with noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band Harmonia music again has brought some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: Targeted inquiries showed that the name, though blurred through the collective pop memory, is not so sustainable that this band has been painfully missing for 32 years.
But why should the Germans not also be allowed to celebrate their living legends of the 1970s?
Especially because what is called misleading grape rock was always more true in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Lifework to the survivors of the Cologne Can 2003 group, in the hall there were questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked themselves in the Laudatio even to the band La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the surprise knew no boundaries.
At concerts, Michael Rother later hit the stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old companion.
The problem of ignorance at home and of explanation in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years, and during that time it also developed a much smaller power than it was later assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had musiced with the artist Conrad Schnitzler earlier under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the celler under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label undertaken by the Church.
Rother had helped for a short time at Kraftwerk and then played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the then most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as city-flying communars.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to suffer as a child girl.
Especially in the artistic presence.
It is said that there was also a wimpel of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for art.
Sometimes there was harmony.
The first album was “Music of Harmonia” and the following “De Luxe”.
Because so left and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material need.
The collection of travel did not serve solely for self-finding.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was co-cuted at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record scene of about 50 feet, as someone believes to imagine.
From Rother came then the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius, it is an immeasurable claim.
In 1975, the band declared its separation.
Rother landed in the Esoteric-Spheric and secureed his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its plate company Greenland has set its goal to maintain the Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! was already grabbed like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old-punk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
What the entire range of the influences of the Krautrocks would be distorted on the subsequent pop music.
From Harmonia, the emptiness of the supergroup is filled.
Brian Eno’s phrase flows with the most isolated sounds in the hall: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures that show the producer with harmony in the farmer.
The legend formation serves projections of other black-and-white photos of wirr-cable devices.
Three veterans were again involved in improvisation.
No more by attaching microphones to the organ and to the bullet to lock the instruments over self-basted effect devices unhearded sounds.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in Technically deepened roofs.
This does not change the chore of the house as well.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgensterns, it is hanged and swallowed under sound clouds and in a beautiful place with an emphase singing "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music schools (Can), technology (fuel power plant) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever calls '68' is not completely wrong, and harmony cannot be taken out of it even now.
The most obvious thing is thoroughly reviewed on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can steal the nerves of a person, or flying moments give you great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
“The Hunting Party” and “Murderic Peace” are two films that deal with the Balkan War.
Both do not convince.
Or the concepts put too much on action and bullets, or they are too touchable.
Richard Gere can’t help in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighty-year-old last time, because too many untouched roles in women’s good-minded films and too many press conferences on Buddhism threatened the desire to look out.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunter" (Why should the film titles today really always be as long and crazy as locker-leader tariff contracts?)
In fact, his war reporter, Simon Hunt, is what could have been true if the fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best times long behind, but who, even as a ruined monument of his fall, has retained considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trick, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Murderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian from Kosovo's hexadectors, and one soon falls in love with them.
Although it is pleasant that the Serbs are not presented here as the only root of all evil, the TV film is too quickly losing itself in bullshit and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war for it.
On the contrary, "The Hunting Party" can explore just exemplaryly why there has never been a really good Balkan war film yet.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to discover the Serbian supreme war criminal "the Fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at a different time with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
For the stories seem to be striking: both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military cannot do, and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downward cynic with heart as he will be introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must tell him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, the Hunting Party will then go down when reporters in the last five minutes in the time limit process succeed what NATO, CIA and all the head money huntingers in the world have failed in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a profound human concern.
He wants to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to run, and he suspect the Americans and the French (here they should be exceptionally agreed) not to engage in the persecution because of secret political agreements.
But the good and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s work table: “I see compassionate the swallowed stunners, indicating how hard it is to be evil.”
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but showing how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been in this newspaper that all Iraqi films were Hollywood’s great flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South African film yet.
It’s almost always true: when a star travels around the world on the crises or mining fields, there’s something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All conflicts may just be too close in time.
Decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the Schindler's List.
Some films are likely to be mature – the Vietnam’s works “The Deer Hunter”, “Apocalypse Now” or “Full Metal Jackett” which are now considered classic have not been celebrated in any way as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes home on the same two screens, even just too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that’s stealing the scriptors the negligence they need to tell good stories.
"Being or Not Being" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Per you need to have the sarcasticly distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked for parallels between his historic novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just because some things never change.
“Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered cruelly, and war will always rule in Yugoslavia.”
By Beust criticized for Olympia
The demolition of the mayor from the Hamburg application for the Summer Olympics has encountered heavy criticism in politics and economics.
Many people want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But von Beust encourages realism in evaluating the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, said on Wednesday a resignation was "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed so great motivation in the city as the Olympia idea.
“Without this goal, the sport policy trend would not beined in the same degree.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to buri the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, “which is based on a changing timeline.”
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are at least unrealistic until 2028.
“Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic advertising, but the German Olympic Sports Federation,” said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the sports federation’s decision to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, which was expected to begin December.
“This preference means for us that we will not have realist opportunities in the period we have previously expected by 2028.
Nevertheless, the dream has not been exhausted forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This makes the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to get a chance by buriing the plans already at this time,” HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply is also contrary to the statement of the Chairman of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the full assembly of the General German Higher Education Association.
There, Beust called Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade “not as a replacement” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Higher Education Sports Association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD citizenship group warned the Senate not to have spent valuable time on the building of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Small Grasbrooks has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put Olympia on the map and exploded the housing,” said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grasbrook has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a subsequent residential use, the CDU has unilaterally put on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time caused great enthusiasm.
Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol’s boxes.
Whoever combines the terms Sweden and Woodstock, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or not?
Currently, wood boxes manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's worksheet.
Most of the 49 Brillo boxes listed there from the “Type Stockholm” are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo boxes, internal research at the Modern Museum in Stockholm now comes to a fevering outcome: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén presented to the Modern Museum in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of about a hundred more Brillo boxes from the "Type Stockholm" that are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is overwhelmed, a confusing network of artistic and curatory productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the popcards of the "Brillo" soap powder.
A exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 presented - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes of paper: These did not come (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonagen factory.
It was not about works of art, but their patterns, merely exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Modern Museum.
Time scientists are now talking about about fifteen boxes that were rightly entered into the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that there were about a hundred wooden boxes produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Modern Museum, has, in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, also investigated three Swedish private-owned boxes, two of which were made in 1968 in Stockholm: their press panels were first grounded and scattered, then white oil color was applied with a pencil.
The structure of the 1990 copies, however, suggests that the color was applied directly to the press panel with a paint roll without grounding - in addition, it is not oil, but acrylic color.
“These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brillo Boxes,” says Lars Nittve, director of the Modern Museum: “If the ‘Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board’ in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition materials.”
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it will follow the “hard accusations” that are being raised regarding the soap powder boxes.
Since then, there has been an unbeatable silence.
Rebellion soldiers in Manila
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers gave up in a hotel in Manila, calling for the collapse of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, the leader Antonio Trillanes, who warned the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government soldiers had previously destroyed the hotel under drunk gas operation.
The two dozen soldiers had been singing in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly stop with about 30 sympathisants.
The military policemen, who were actually to watch him, had apparently gone over to him and joined his measurement.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces blocked the district around the hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics have called for large protests against the president on Friday.
His government has been overwhelmed by corruption accusations for months.
Manil's financial district was the main site of the attempted measurement of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo in 2003.
The rebellion failed after just 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, the company on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the capital.
It was previously speculated about the acquisition.
The option is open to increasing the share of Versatel.
With the step we want to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, suspicions had already arisen after the Berenberg Bank increased its share in the Düsseldorfer network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house holds the shares only for a third party, it was said in the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet had already participated with 10 percent in the mobile company Trillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million of these shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
Furthermore, the companies began discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile communications products.
“We strengthen our partnership,” a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies have founded the Community company MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
Currently, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of more than 10 percent in Freenet and do not take advantage of their right to take over another 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, especially to further increase their participation in Freenet AG.
The talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were closed in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which lasts for months and is hard to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contracts and 1.27 million DSL and full-connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held directly 6,01 percent of Freenet’s shares.
It is now agreed that Trillisch will bring about 4 percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
