The SSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the bakery.
The new ČSSD councilors in the capital will, it seems, have to overcome the obvious language barriers in order for the members of the Prague City Council and the City Council to understand their renewed ODS colleagues.
Aktuálně.cz period "tested" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang markup language that has emerged in the last few years in the Council, when the current coalition members ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary used by the political cream of Prague during the previous period, Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the metropolis' best-known characters, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know, to be honest".
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics", said the city councilor for culture Lukáš Kaucký during the examination of the terminology of "college".
And as for the veteran politician, Karel Březina reacted the same.
You may be familiar with the concept of a golf hole.
"It's probably the only expression of all the ones you've asked me that I use from time to time".
"If not, I usually don't use slang".
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the ODS voting congress, the editorial team chose six examples, particularly those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague's largest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "armor".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not return to the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, flatly refused to do so.
"I don't get involved in these things and I don't value how civic democrats have fun".
"What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programmes", he said.
As we have seen, supposedly councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký, the word "Voldemort" means nothing; the only term he got right on the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel", says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know it from the news".
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course", he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one to recognize the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also Environment Councillor Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both social democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; moreover, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think he means to go to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge he obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the survey, no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms exists among the Social Democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, but it really seems we have nothing in common".
"Instead, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we make word games with the names", says Prague's ČSSD president, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"In school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that", confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is either Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election deceptions during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") from some of his colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that the social democrats tolerate in the party's internal discourse.
Hulínský doesn't like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of the rights of the batons" seems to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
Government wants to limit torture of "witches", says brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work for health reasons, single and without children.
Women who "become" witches are sent to a secluded area, so they don't harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such sin".
"Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help with the work and have children", explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, is in charge of a special home for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an informative pamphlet that should help to prevent witch hunts.
This has a catch, though.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", warns Die Standard newspaper about the drawbacks of written awareness-raising.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and set her on fire.
The news was on the BBC.
The authors claim it was due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
According to her account, the woman was caught in the oil used for ritual anointing.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "exorcise the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Soul eaters have always been a danger".
While in Burkina Faso the Government is trying to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the President still participated in it.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a massive witch hunt allegedly linked to his death and attempted to kill the president himself through black magic".
"To help him, he brought in shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's property in Kanilai", said Amnesty International in its report.
At the farm, the people arrested had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay at the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala tenant: heating himself with coal stoves and signing a higher rent
The elderly and frail man walked through the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under her arm she carried some documents with the new lease agreements for three floors: hers, her daughter's and her son's, who is serving a sentence.
All three of them just got their asses kicked by the rent liberalisation.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns from next year for a two-room flat with a separate kitchen in the second category.
"In addition, it has no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler", the man points with his finger at his son's new contract, over which he has full authority to sign.
"But I signed it", he explains, half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes a gesture.
"Everyone says one thing", he says with a grim face.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year's it will happen with the vast majority of flats that, in the Czech Republic, were until now under a regulated rent.
So Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and by 9 a.m. on Tuesday it was already full.
Right by the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to take numbers.
"Rental 2011", can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When pressed, a number is printed on a piece of paper.
It hardly takes him long to read "157" and the number appears on the big screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrive to inquire, but the crowd in the hall is not here for the new tenants.
Most people come to solve the usual problems, as in the old days: requests for repairs, insurance issues and similar matters.
Letters with the new lease agreements will reach the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG in Ostrava around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in the rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18th, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's just starting", the workers who are in the shop respond after a brief hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Liberalisation and the old miners' flats in Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already dealt with loud and clear by the vice-president of the Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, from Ostrava, and now they appear continuously in the area's newspapers.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change my damn bathroom sink", the man quoted at the outset blurts out.
According to the workers, for the moment they come mostly retired to check if they get a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half the discount on the February rent.
However, the window of opportunity for "liberalisation" of mining certainly does not dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked for rent in 2011", the window clerk estimates.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and in its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties cannot agree on the rent, an independent judge must settle the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legal way of acting", warns RPG on its pages.
"Here you are not going to judge anyone", one of the employees of RPG Byty said, and a man standing in the street in front of the customer service center agrees with her, at least in part.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and have 5,000 left for food; I don't have the means to go to court", he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see about that".
"Mr Zaoralek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait", he says.
The rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rentals still do not even cover the amounts needed for the maintenance of the community fund", recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that annoys the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for raising the rent.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments with the rentals, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The big screen hanging from the ceiling, facing the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data highlighted in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's properties.'
'In addition, there will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square metre per month,' it says on the screen.
Just a 38% increase in rent for 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 crowns per square metre", says RPG.
At 2,600 flats, the rent will remain unchanged for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect rentals all at once, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) back into the flats, mainly in savings on heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the lease agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need a nursery.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would think that it also hides a small nursery inside with everything that is typical of such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees can attend.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose studio produced many well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-nursery.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of a reduced working time, the day care is one of the benefits which Arch.Design offers its workers in the framework of its social programme.
The women in construction and architecture are thus able to combine a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-nursery was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-nursery is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
The funding (an allocation of over CZK 2.8 million) enabled them to buy equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), the Arch.Design company is obliged to maintain the mini-nursery with its own funds for three years.
The project took a year to prepare and the Economy Rating company contributed to the submission of the application for funding.
The children are looked after by qualified staff and are cared for by a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education who are present all day long.The nursery currently accommodates children of all ages, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-kindergarten", it can accommodate only a maximum of five children at a time, although with the shifts more come during the day.
The operation of the day care centre is flexible to suit the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the day care centre, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although the curriculum is individual, the contents of the mini-nursery are comparable to the curriculum of the regular preschool.
Children do not just play in it, but they also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach English.
The classroom has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive atmosphere.
Parents can visit their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when away from their place of work.
So parents are more productive while they work.
Not surprisingly, this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the employee and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firms offering a big advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this programme reinforced the marketing of personnel.
The House of Bones still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble a dinosaur's spine, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeletal shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colours, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that recalls the scales and the omnipresent smoothly curved lines, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The front of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and wildlife.
Paying closer attention, you notice a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is enhanced.
The serpentine and twisting forms continue to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood is used for window frames, railings, door ornaments, peepholes, and signs.
Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively commercial street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of a house of the year 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, consisting of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his project plans appeared ornaments for the representative apartment of the property owner and the mosaics used in the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and the Güell park of Gaudí, in which other pieces of the same are found.
Because of its organic shape, the locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building conceal religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the era with ventilation fans and typical chimneys.
Its forty-five degree inclination may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not let himself be influenced by them.
However, the building obtained the appropriate permit from the beginning, although evidently the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked with the result that it asked for it to be corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: only fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner moved into the lower floors.
The living room was on the second floor gallery, and the bedrooms and private part of the apartment were on the third floor.
The ground floor is rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a staircase leading up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudi's reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
Also impressive are Gaudí's play with light, the white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard, and the skylights.
The two-color set brings the maximum amount of light to all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than do dark colors, which in turn absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the list of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most refurbished apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The visits confirmed, or discovered, that this was a very profitable business and they extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, reaching 16,50 euros, although students, pensioners and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other constructions of Gaudí in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real bed atmosphere with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to Choose a Mattress and a Bedspread - Women and Men Look for Different Things
Nothing fancy about a bed frame; what really gives a good bed its quality is the surface on which to lie, that is, the mattress and the mattress.
First of all, they must be perfectly complementary so that they are adapted to the specific users.
During the choice, numerous factors come into play, including the owner's weight, height, health status, and sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress and pillow are placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that is not usually heated, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
Furthermore, they are usually considerably heavier than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them over more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly ventilated and are on top of a firm foundation, they keep moisture in.
Customs also play a role in the choice of a bed.
A person who has spent a lot of time abroad will often use a very high mattress with a soft coating and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here".
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a soft coating of viscoelastic".
"These mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system problems, which means they don't get the information from the joints and the skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specialises in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred the viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these appropriate Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelasticity anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape based on absorbed heat or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not spin around like after a hard match.
It just makes you sleep better.
The viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of your feet to its height, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about six feet will need a bed between six and seven feet.
The minimum width for a single person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
For single rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120-140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably curled up towards your elbows", advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert in Czech decorating, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years, a subject she teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs his own mattress and bed, so when buying, you have to pay attention to combining the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, the bed pillows will have to be mounted at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, models with springs at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
"When touched by hand or when sitting on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticeable", warns Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress requires a certain type of mattress.
Fully padded bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you cannot wash their covers, which is often done today.
And since we sweat between two and three quarts of a liter of sweat every night, it is clear that after about five to seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that talk about a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
But everything has a but.
Therefore, the salesmen give a tip: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully clean and wash the cover, but it is better to add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers are now manufactured with zipper closures throughout their perimeter, so when opening they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a bedside table, do you have a solid board?
I never will!
At least for beds designed for overnight visitors.
However, it must make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the board and must be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft coat.
The polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulating sheet mattresses containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre) may be used, although a mattress with a higher number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar sheets are reinforced and the rigidity can be adjusted is always preferable.
The jointed sheet pillows should not be used with a spring mattress as it does not react to recline.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special attachment of the sheets that allows the sheets to be pressed or even tilted so that they perfectly "surround" the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is a very important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers remember them, who, in the "male", began to use a softer zone precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer zone around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross- or slab-shaped summers with so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also note that even if you use the proper mattress and pillow, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mulida"), most of the advantages will be lost.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners should only reach the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can be relaxed.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder-supported pillowcase or the softer part of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers are still increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in vogue.
The petroleum-based raw materials from which polyurethane foam is made are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soya oil.
In fact, practically all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for the microcapsules, which release a fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "cool" themselves with vegetable extracts from the breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs the heat and cools the body, women prefer to "warm" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warm.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold foam stiffness and viscoelasticity allows for the manufacture of mattresses of various zones that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those with a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as healthcare facilities.
The first to obtain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save on mattresses and beds.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or vendors can be approved, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 kroner.
The second one is free.
The era of viscoelasticity with an open cellular structure and high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It was originally developed as a NASA material because during take-off, astronauts were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur melts with heat and hardens with cold.
Thus, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and adapts optimally to its pressure.
It is therefore ideal for preventing sores, but also for improving comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
The domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver and similar.
More and more parents are using people-tracking devices to monitor their children.
Fear for their children is leading more and more people to think about monitoring them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, to the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At present the device is about the size of a matchbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and started to find out about the means available to better protect her children.
Even at the cost of invading her privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that this is not spying, but another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases, such devices can be misused, for example, by getting into someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases".
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons", adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even young children are very creative in deliberately losing things to avoid being controlled".
"Parents used to rely on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device", says Bočková.
In his view, it is debatable whether such a device is really useful in case of an attack.
"If it is a planned kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check to see if the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that might reveal their location".
"Now it's the phone".
"As the use of tracking devices spreads, so will they, as their sale will undoubtedly be done with much publicity".
"In such cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of a makeshift attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, their presence can be helpful.
'The device may be configured to regularly send the position after a specified period.'
"If you suffer damage, at least you will facilitate the last position of the person in question".
"The most expensive devices have a built-in tiltmeter, so if the person simply slips and stands still, the device will immediately give a warning with the position in question", says Čech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with mobile smartphones with navigation, on which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices that are about the size of a matchbook or the smaller size of mobile phones.
So you can get lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being conducted with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device".
"Or that it identifies him after a certain time, which can buy time for the police", he adds.
Although the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hung up, they will still use the same technology as used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough flares to surround the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech Army bought 277 miles of fuse to ignite explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
So they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the explosive wick from the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha saying that the soldiers need for the training maneuvers 60 kilometers of mecha a year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES got in touch, it is decided however that, in such a case, all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners should also perform such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year.
They did not want exemptions nor did Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only then could the army justify spending 60 kilometers of mecha.
That length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough supplies for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of mecha, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra because they say they have hardly any ammunition for various weapons, so they are limited even to shooting practices for money.
And let's not even talk about the lack of underwear.
"I can't understand why we are bought such quantities of wick repeatedly".
"But it's their decision and they'll definitely know why they're acting like this".
"For us, the army is a good customer whom we, as a company, try to satisfy", admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha also saying that he will have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group indicates that the wick has a lifespan of only four years and, in the case of military or police pyrotechnic products, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four years", says one of the soldiers who, because of possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its service life, each round must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometres of wick, it obtained a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers", says Pejšek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense's purchasing center.
For comparison's sake, the annual consumption of firewood by police firemen, who remove the ammunition from World War II or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
Furthermore, the police always ask only the right amount to use up the ammunition before its useful life is over.
It was decided for reasons of safety for the pyrotechnics and, in addition, in the meantime more modern and reliable types of firework can be obtained.
The Ministry is already having clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old mecha will have to be removed, which is now being bought "cheaply".
I still live off the contacts I made through the contest.
Winning the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in selling his hotel franchise.
The last edition, the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" won the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun was a man who loved to travel.
Abroad he realised that in Liberec he needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he had made from seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan, he bought a five-story, half-ruined house.
Considering that he was still in his third year of college, he was really brave.
"The quality-price ratio of accommodation in our area has now prompted me to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor that was rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned he reinvested back into the building, which he gradually turned into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he managed to gradually open in Liberec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise", said the number one entrepreneur last year.
"The fact that we won the 'Entrepreneur of the year' competition helped a lot with this sale of hotel licences", adds the grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, still often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice", she recalls.
He would certainly recommend any company that wants to try out to enter the competition.
But he feels that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he is still living off of the contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"Some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate habitually".
The fame associated with success, in his view, also included in the employees,
In total, about seventy.
"I have seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be a part of something that gained general recognition".
"It is not, by any means, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team".
"It's just that my name is on the front page", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a year more peaceful than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the victor, it's possible that Farmet has already gotten over the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, was awarded the first prize in the latest edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" competition last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award has not only encouraged me but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competition", says the winner of last year.
The story of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered Karel Žďárský's father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, she did not hesitate too much; she resigned from her position in the company where she worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with her father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began specializing in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the general public after success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also the foreign partners started to value the collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, perhaps, it was not just a display of victory euphoria in Farmet.
It also received recognition for the business results up to 2008 and partially 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year ever for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, evidently, are not exempt from such a situation either".
"We had to limit production and even had some layoffs", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and kept the company's profits, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
However, where Farmet did not cut spending was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence on the international market and obtained excellent ratings at national fairs", says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Revenues are rising again and with them the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", notes Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to eliminate some ridiculous regulations.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration asked for an extract from the Trade Register, although its officials can obtain it with two moves of the mouse.
Thanks to the poll, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it conducts a check on the insured's taxes", said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The aim of the absurdity survey of the year is to find out what rules and regulations companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those which are absurd.
This year it is taking part in the business tournament of the Hospodářské noviny publication for the fourth time and is also starting to attract interest from the general public.
While last year's edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
And it's not surprising, because we still have a lot of legal obligations that we have to meet just to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of documents required for tax return we are first in the world", says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated objective of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation is improving, especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in the ranking of the conditions for starting a business, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can point to some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the competition closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the competition organizer chooses seven candidates for the "pre-prize" and during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
For this year's survey, over a hundred rules and regulations were submitted, including 105 that don't make sense.
The examples were sent by businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the 70 proposals for this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Prague's Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, attended the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continually imposes obstacles on entrepreneurs, so my aim is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade", announced Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not end in drunken waters.
In 2007, what most bothered people was the obligation of the employer to inform three days in advance the business office in the permanent operating zone of his intention to attend a fair or exhibition with a stand.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The requirement that came second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the reporting to the labour office by their foreign workers of business trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third one is the winner.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
So this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the requirement to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty of this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Business of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair enterprises.
"In this way we want to support companies that are concerned about the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator Vodafone, organiser and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebelde of the year competition.
This new special subcategory of this year's edition of the Vodafone Enterprise 2010 main competition was open to companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write a separate article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, in another, personal problems or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists from across the Republic was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main funder of disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery shop which is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, who make up more than 70% of the workforce; this is why it was awarded the title of the company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it finished in third place in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded to them because they buy from Czech manufacturers in the first place, support Community activities in the area and respect the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities have the least possible impact on the environment", explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
The IT company Enlogit from Ústí Region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local sheltered company.
"In addition, we support the Persons in Need scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, a company representative.
The company Praní a čištění in the Karlovy Vary region is also well placed with a mention, whose employees receive special bonuses that are passed on to their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, upskilling and leisure", says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Bruntál Czasch, which won in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The category of responsible company of the year was automatically awarded to all regional finalists of the Vodafone company of the year competition who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organisers before 15 August.
The organisers removed from the evaluation those forms that were not complete or incorrect.
'If the representatives of the competing undertakings did not answer the questions, they could not take part in the contest for Responsible Business of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the main contest for Vodafone Business of the Year.'
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Enterprise of the Year competition", explains Karel Goldman of the consultancy firm Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate developer Luboš G.
This appears to have been an attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of the rights so that the auctioned land would be received by a specific interested party.
He owed Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender", the head of the general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that at the moment she cannot divulge more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How it could have influenced the public auction, given the lack of official information, can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman of the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Černá answered Právo's questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"This is a customer, not one of our workers", he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called 'Call for Proposals for Land Transfer in accordance with the Land Law' and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the land value is announced".
"Based on the bids, the order of buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the highest bid", explained the Fund spokeswoman.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to be present at the call and, as he is also an interested party because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to the interested parties on the ground that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
That would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He was involved in the case of former PF boss Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Mr Luboš has just obtained from the Fund land for public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a major road to the Borská pole industrial area is to be built.
Then he exchanged them profitably with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns a month.
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred more crowns from their portfolios each month from January onwards.
Electricity prices rise by 4.6%, gas prices by around 2%, some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for water supplies and many cities are also increasing the price of central heating.
The electricity bill for families living in apartments should be about 100 krona more per year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, due to increasing support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic.
However, gas becomes moderately more expensive, especially at the time when heating is used most and therefore consumption is highest.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are getting more expensive all over the country, the change in the price of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the larger municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay from January onwards about 50 krona more per month for central heating, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 krona extra per year.
Prague residents will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, the Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In Northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
Rental prices for 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January, may increase considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court anyone who doesn't agree with the new lease.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of about 300,000 flats, could rise next year by as much as 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk on Fernet and rum.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to get over a hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors encountering such cases in the hospital's paediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk".
"Hard drinks are the new trend", Luděk Pelikán, head of pediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, told Právo.
"When they manage to grab a bottle from their father's pantry, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka".
"The vodka has the advantage that it lighten with juice and that it doesn't smell as bad", he explains.
This was also confirmed by the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Usually, it's either Fernet or rum".
"That's the modern alcoholic beverage, particularly among schoolchildren".
"In some cases, they use home-made spirit", adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelican, it's 13- and 14-year-old drinkers who usually show up at hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in the pediatrics department in Motol, where ambulances brought young people from nearby areas.
"One girl had to go in maybe four times".
"It started at the age of 12, when she was brought in with 3.5 of alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture with ecstasy", says the department doctor about this case.
"I was at the fair in Holešovice at some dance party".
"What's interesting is that her mother wasn't even surprised that her daughter was gone for 48 hours", the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of parental interest or even their clear tolerance of drinking by their children that is considered to be the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts say that in the case of children, it is not really a question of dependence.
"Alcoholic is defined as a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the associated phenomena, which does not occur in children".
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is more likely due to a systematically failed social or family environment", explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic in Motol, forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come in with severe intoxication and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after a routine medical examination, go home with their parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink brandy, for Pelican there are three seasonal highs and lows to mention: Halloween, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"In such a situation, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"On Halloween I have seen up to seven drunken children at once", adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under medical supervision paradoxically have the advantage of not suffering a terrible hangover at home the next day.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by the injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"These people are much better off because after a hectic night, they get up and don't feel any pain".
"They just get confused about where they are", says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their good humor at least when they see the expenses they have incurred.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used cost as a means of education, when I tell the children directly on the visit how much their drinking has cost them and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job in order for you to earn enough to pay for that night", adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in your opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are found for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that a device of this type has been found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for training or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until the moment used the Czech army and was still in flying condition.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still held by Aer Vodochody and the intermediary for the sale, the company Omnipol, took them over last week.
Jan Peješk from the defense press department indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically removed from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seaters, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, without any additional investment or contribution from the Ministry".
'The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their present state,' he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army is not without two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary devices L-159 for two-seaters.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS was committed to the planes being added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that is withdrawing the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for pilot training from NATO countries".
'It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this context,' says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published prematurely that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.500 million crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense leadership claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159s abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24 of them, so they want to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already brought a case before the European Court of Justice against the Czech Ministry of Defence for choosing aircraft by a European tender rather than by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in 14 days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men with a longer index than the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer journal.
It could depend on your testosterone levels, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to 60 years of age", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could therefore help determine which men should be screened for prostate cancer, particularly if this trait is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and simultaneously 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same odds of getting prostate cancer as the 19% of those with the same length of fingers.
For men with an index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60 the reduction reached 87%.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The senior Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he is aware of the study, but does not think that the link between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, saw the dawn on Thursday covered in snow.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compacted snow and snow plows circulated all night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of the Ústředný automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, at 93 two industrial vehicles collided causing injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the canyon.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should drive slowly behind Brno at kilometre 190 or cross Brno and join at kilometre 182 at Kývalce.
There are several kilometers of traffic jams.
There's also been an accident on the D11 highway, just outside Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow several centimeters deep and the thermometers indicate -7 degrees Celsius.
Traffic jams are forming for example in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams are running late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three expresses.
The problems concern, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyně airport was closed from 11pm on Wednesday until 5am.
Today, most of the southern Moravian roads are open to traffic, but with extreme caution.
At Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, at Brněnska snow tongues are forming and at Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened to traffic.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, as a protected natural area, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, and in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually decreasing in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American military is deploying in Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known at the moment only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" to their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with an extremely accurate aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high charge of explosives it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point along their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall, or a trench.
No doubt, he cannot use normal protection, and when he casts his murderous shower of metal splinters, he may prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"Soldiers manipulate it so that they find the target, aim their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then gets an accurate aiming point and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and squeezes the trigger".
"Let's say that you have measured 543 meters".
"When the trigger is pulled, the weapon is loaded and launches the projectile to a distance of 1,800 feet [543.5 m], plus or minus one, two, or three feet", says Audette.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their place of work from their former office building on the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu consortium is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July next year from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously dispersed in the region, will be accommodated there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the new office in Astro Park will improve the way employees work.
Furthermore, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said: 'At Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure.'
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important nowadays for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of the Frankfurt section for economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this was a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (Greens) is saddened by Fujitsu's decision.
The management informed the city of their intention.
"We have of course offered the company our help", Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the property owner in Marienbader Platz have not been able to turn in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons produced the fall.
So, now there's a big empty spot to fill in the famous post.
"I expect the building's owner and tenant to be cooperative".
The building previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" had been part of a controversial construction project for the spa town for ten years, along with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the city hall a new entrance to the city is formed, which takes care of the criticism in terms of the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001 investment advisory and valuation firms were set up, the manufacturer of software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originally from Tokyo, is recognized as the world's third largest IT provider.
It has businesses, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is located in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That's why they've leased 20,000 square feet of the Astro Park office building.
The former complex of the 1920s, whose name refers to its star-shaped plan, houses the central association of electrical engineering and the electronics industry, among others.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anger is taking over Wikileaks more and more.
The internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Political pressure may be behind the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly being held in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
Well-known American Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, should remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
"WikiLeaks expelled from Amazon server".
"Speak freely in the land of freedom", activists communicated the revelations via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had turned to the Amazon web services to publish secret diplomatic documents in order to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
Wikileaks tweeted the following: "Perfect, we'll use our dollars to hire people in Europe".
If Amazon has a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported from a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate's council for the country's security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wished that Amazon had taken these steps earlier, before the previous publications of classified information through Wikileaks", the senator declared.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban in other countries the use of the server.
"The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate process of Wikileaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world", the independent senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden for suspected rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is in custody in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently branded the investigation in Sweden as a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange".
That's why he fears for Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
So the location of the WikiLeaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the statements made by the United States.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated, clearly with irony, on television, that Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, a great dispute is growing.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, in case she is responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in espionage recently.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website".
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of its database protection in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution for the National Counterterrorism Center, has been named special envoy, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that in order to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to contact them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary".
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice creams are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream really come from?
The ice cream maker and the ice cream man.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream man takes the ice cream cream off the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the bar and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in the year 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creamers has the highest number of attendees and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires on the soft ice.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of this art from California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future she wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own within a few years within a tiring job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master fryer Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is its good taste decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training nor the cream cover of the national and mainly southern house: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic".
The first step to elaboration seems to be a piece of cake.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients - milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar, and stabilizers - into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then cools it to four degrees.
Then you open the tap of the machine and out comes a basic pasteurized white cream, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made with only natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they disregard the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite into a granite ice cream cone.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
They use fragrances.
As for the taste of ice cream, master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit or candy section of the supermarket.
Plus, there's powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will attempt to blend flavoured ingredients into their merchandise".
"You should try it sometime, though".
Whether it's fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even the cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will turn into a yellow cream and cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them each time to make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They do the same experiment with different kinds of fruit ice cream.
That it tastes better does not necessarily mean that it has more toffee or more fruit purée.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't have to taste like dried fruit, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and somewhat less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture brings out the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream is a problem of arithmetic: If you use peach purée with a lot of sugar, you have to lower the sugar ratio of the basic recipe.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which he fixes the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the charts make the counting easy.
Making ice cream requires no more than the physical application, as before.
Not only does the tool help for the automatic processing of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to below zero temperature.
Yet all automation is left out in the small stuff.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were a giant mini-premiere out of control.
"In all the courses", says teacher Luciano, "it's just a matter of time before something like this happens".
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European food safety authority EFSA has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This is currently the view of the Testbiotech group, which considers itself an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It seems like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well", said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been employed for many years in the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer are paying for it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to EFSA's testing standards for genetically modified plants, placing him in a clear conflict of interest, Then argues.
The provisions of Efsa are in the same paragraphs with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the company's deed, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
So, recently, a senior manager from EFSA went without support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed sides with that.
Recently, the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were made by the Environmental Inspector General as well as a visionary EU parliamentarian.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data are used, also some from industry, provided they are of high technical quality, they are ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have no contact with industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others, to assess the risk to biotechnology without the Lobby's commission.
On this subject, independent experts, such as Then, criticise the fact that currently transgenic plants are allowed without research into animal food and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture", says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" the accuser asks, then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
"Industry controls the research of security", Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has gotten some, totaling about 400 kilos.
Monday I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind me.
There were demonstrations.
It was Nevabah.
The story is well known: In September, the bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large portion of the north wing.
The Stuttgart ground was never the same again: thousands and thousands demonstrated against s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
Because it was sealed, most of the wing was in ruins.
Rotate it into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he's 43 years old.
He's got a couple of pieces secured.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural".
Like he once said, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former munitions depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals in antique stones.
He bought everything from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump", he says in his office, a small wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, it appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He talked to the 21st's enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that there was absolutely nothing he could do about the demolition.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 S21 enemies took the 80-kilogram mazizo cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest was sold long ago.
He owns gardens, landscapes, manages projects.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on board.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special", Rongen says.
"If it wasn't for the political component".
He climbs his all-terrain, takes a tour of his vast 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And he's a lover of the stones.
It holds 4,000 tons of rock.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer in antique stones in the country.
- What?
In the snow there are artistic sandstone cuts.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge", he explains.
White lime, yellow, warm, it is excited.
"My precious stone".
The road goes through the woods.
It marks a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of the Karlsruhe station.
And it goes on.
"Nice little travertine".
In the past, the mazzi belonged to the grandstand at the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
All over the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuba from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones and moved them with a simple tackle and a cart, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed".
He hasn't become rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to work on the stone cutter, besides stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying", says the man who is in charge of the recovery.
Soon he must go to Cologne.
There are stones to be rescued there, too.
Competition of talents around great potentials
Queen, there's a lot of people at the buffet.
16 students are crammed around the buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
And in the same way, many companies, like VW, are coming together in a close-knit battle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Its mission: To recruit the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And since universities don't provide publications on their students' abilities, it's trying to spot outstanding talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the consortium wins the talent.
A young lady from the personnel department is handing out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo on them.
It explains to the young talents the internship programmes and the work for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is leading the project with VW.
I see benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience".
"In turn, VW can get to know the students, observe the interesting candidates more closely and consider them as potential future workers".
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that the students are desired so directly.
"The main point was previously in technical projects", says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
If not they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 engineer vacancies.
And, according to the VDI's forecasts, this engineer void will grow even more.
At the auditing and consulting firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the talent hunt.
It organises expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern-day yincana, in which participants have to find their way by GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It's decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the exit.
Only the cream of the crop of many participants goes to the US.
Universities are increasingly striving to select and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race, we want to stand out from the crowd".
"The simple journey alone was not enough".
For the scout Dykta, the grades give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants".
"Some are close to their end, and they want to apply to work with us", he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their job fairs.
"We try to get students in the specialized fairs".
"Something about Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, a personnel manager for the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacancies are listed on the company's website.
"It's getting very complicated to fill the vacancies".
"It takes a lot of time and money", he says.
A shorter route is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The teachers advise that they can do internships with us or do their theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
This is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer this", says Staff Manager Stübe.
In the job search, money is no longer the most important thing.
Decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion prospects.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute produces an annual list of the best German job providers.
So he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the job and the environment in it and looks at the employees' previous conditions.
Staff manager Stübe also expects extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
"I think the applicant is particularly looking at the external ratings of a potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves", he says.
In the industry jargon it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get a promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with a gang", Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a sweeping ban and thereby irrevocably cancelled its earlier plans.
New drilling is also prohibited on the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
The trigger for this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that claimed the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the US dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To this day it is not entirely clear who is responsible for the irreparable oil spill in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of claims.
An inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Interior Minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil consortiums submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and stricter safety regulations.
The responsible control authority, which has been discredited after being accused of corruption, is currently being reformed.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry is publicly announcing that total Gulf production will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries", says the result of the current survey conducted by the consulting firm BDO - before Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows what exactly changes with regulation".
Investments in new extraction projects are being delayed, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
Rivers are oil-marl, smell like a gas station: Millions of liters of spilled crude have devastated nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems to agree.
"Don't be tired", the environmental activist reassures the reporters: "Enough oil will pass before your eyes today".
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in water up to their chests with the glow of lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colourful glow of the water, the scene almost looks pretty.
You don't see brown oil stains floating on the surface.
"I used to take shrimp by the hand", explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil spilled into the formidable wetland from a broken pipeline.
Fish from around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and situated in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamp, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine stirs up a brown broth, and whoever dips his hand in the water will get a few barrels of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the clashing palms and hanging their palms.
In vain are they looking for flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with the smell of petrol station expands on it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle", says Celestine Akpobari, "We live in constant health danger".
We're moving to war comparison.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a fierce battleground for years: Here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the Shell consortium had to place its first factory in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil workers.
Even today, companies are forbidden to return to Ogoniland: While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location too unstable for the consortium.
Every 200 yards, steel platforms protruded like bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas trees" called out lovingly from the drillheads.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them are completely corroded.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari believes, so a steady stream of oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have been spilled in the last 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the Exxon Valdez shipwreck 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil theft are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see the tipping of the pipes and leaking pipes as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the conventional world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the pipe failure rates are "about a multiple higher than elsewhere".
In a place that seems to be forgotten from afar, an oil-filled workshop appears under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among the many barrels, sometimes attached to the drilling holes, sometimes scattered arbitrarily over the ground, a fire is blazing: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated on the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's head.
First, gasoline enters the container through the pipes, then oil leaks through the pipeline, and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter barrels of diesel fuel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22 (U.S.).
Delta dwellers are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of the biggest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel at just 40 euro-cents per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: thus reducing the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who rigged the pipeline network that runs through Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this rate, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost every day in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the temporarily stored raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also include politicians and high military officials, store the best in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the management of the population or the lax way of production purely academic.
"If oil companies had not behaved like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would have been no sabotage, no robberies, no illegal refineries".
While the Ogoni conditions are shattered mostly by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Maybe it's better to present another nationality, like Chinese".
Michael is getting nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared", says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers may come any minute".
If the army's special unit catches the illegal refiners, it doesn't threaten to arrest them, but with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely torn our country to pieces", Akpobari says.
Investigators detect dangerous manufacturing defects in the engines of the A380
Apparently the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a crash-landing machine, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can result in "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on board Qantas' Airbus, which made an emergency landing in early November, were much luckier than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and warned of a possible manufacturing defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic engine failure".
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
Australian airline takes legal action against British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a suit in federal court in Sydney that enabled further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce has said his airline will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine mark has lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will be conducting further safety tests on superjumpers equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas aircraft's emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded approximately three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes traffic chaos
Germany all white: Almost the whole country has been snowed overnight.
Many streets are in chaos, with trains and planes failing.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Germany's winter freezes: Almost the entire country experienced freezing temperatures on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow cover of up to 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snow plows are in full swing, removing new snow again and again, but it's not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the Baltic Sea coast.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects high tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snowfall caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, red alert is being called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of fresh snow and strong cold winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the rails or broken catenary and potholes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the inter-city service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia, an ICE train had to stop on its way to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweeping the streets.
At Germany's largest airport, snow-filled winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snow plows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, yet there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, there were already many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
A truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of snow-covered streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after she overturned her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be increasingly soft and dusty and therefore will swirl in gentle gusts.
But the wind will subside.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will no doubt still be very cold, in some places as low as minus 15.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its symbol: According to a news article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently renovated its headquarters: The twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district were modernized, while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the renovation costs, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it is worth owning the properties or selling them and then renting them again", he said.
Germany's largest credit institution is therefore once again giving up its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from an investor in a housing fund and subsequently carried out the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms amounted to approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the newspaper towers, dubbed "Greentowers", at about 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold into a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at this time, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourn the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were presumed dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have yet to be found, because security measures remain weak at the scene of the disaster.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62, were buried in the mine.
A probe was inserted at the site of the disaster, but it found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team could get down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
Bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, relatives and friends remember the deceased with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people have been changed by the brilliant sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They're silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
Flags were flown at half-staff in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", John Key, the New Zealand government president, told the commemorative event.
"But they never came home".
He can't take his son's death until he sees his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the President of the Government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the memorial service.
In the first explosion on November 19th British and South African miners were also buried.
Rescue workers started by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases are removed, the searing temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police superintendent Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does gore fit in with art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is once again exploring the boundaries of the genre with his epic battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he made Walhalla Rising?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) escapes from his tormentors and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fighting, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip the guts out of his enemies' bodies alive when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words during the entire movie and the other characters are carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful death-shouting.
Otherwise, they sit quietly and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of target audiences it is a pity that they cannot mutually rule each other out.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the hairy drug dealer "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more mainstream humor or a little less art house brutality.
A brain mass and a few budding guts cannot deter most fans of art cinema.
Most action fans die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for explainable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team gets to America and gets quiet again.
It's a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, it's all about atmosphere, a fever dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is condoned just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the dismal soundtrack of trance make a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes to him.
Only one little blond boy, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something of an innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents doom, but maybe only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery film that can be hated and admired, to be angered, upset and surprised.
It's an experience.
Mysterious earthquakes
The nuclear energy organization IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this matter until checks are allowed.
At about midnight on September 5th to 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the US international intelligence service of the CIA from the end of April 2008, a common reactor was designed under the name of the proximity of el-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique is hardly used for anything other than the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite imagery.
They showed a computer animation of the reactor components before the destruction, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had been up and running for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than it was then, the enigmas have grown bigger with time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that it saw hardly any indication that the country had "a nuclear weapons program".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "alleged reactor", although they consider the presentation of the CIA "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat responded in a stunning way this summer that the IAEA has "enough material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly cleared away the debris of the alleged "damaged military building" and painstakingly cleared the site.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite imagery of a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments immediately after the attack, which must have greater informative value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after the particle analysis.
Damascus has since refused to discuss it, as it has done with the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection at el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel is also keeping a strict silence.
"We will never comment on it", Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is progressively transforming into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation against the non-proliferation treaty of atomic weapons, which is watched by the IAEA, is pending.
The IAEA considers three more equipment as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed what equipment they are, what their functions are, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the proximity of the cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf from satellite images, which most likely is one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located in or immediately adjacent to a military base, Syria has banned entry to the three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear a search that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to the warnings of the US Secret Service.
Using satellite imagery, the IAEA has evidence that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube on the banks of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna claimed that at least one of the equipment may be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no indication of any sensitive activities", no uranium enrichment or reprocessing, processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is run on unenriched uranium.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be separated for bombs, these central questions are at best plausible assumptions.
Nor is there any doubt that the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
With hundreds of trucks' cargoes missing from the ground, no one has any information on where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognised in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the images from orbit show that the Syrians made land movements at the three allegedly suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent some months developing a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
Damaskus, meanwhile, is also critical of this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a kind of US ambassador, has been calling for the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who is supposed to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This is a very risky path: it requires a majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in the time of war
There's been trouble since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her yet-to-be-named debut.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, at the last moment moving some planned filming days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization for war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' ambassador.
He's not diplomatic. The women offered him a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
You don't get love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's stance on it tells the victims enough about the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended that Jolie be removed as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture who read the script, granted a strip-tease and release a shooting permit in Sarajevo, it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't go after all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating online that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the war started and then reunited when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "rape victim falls in love with torturer" variant.
It's safe to say that Jolie's film actually begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
They can now make peace with Hollywood hackers while the script remains online illegally, like so many others before it.
Nothing like far away from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No sign of distress
The home team, on the other hand, dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans are shouting for joy as the music is loud, they are kicking their feet on the floor.
The Bailey Club vibrates in southern Ireland, Cork, because players are throwing, and finding, ping-pong balls to beer glasses from a distance of three meters.
The bizarre show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus some plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old is trying to have fun with it, distracting from the burning question, what does the future hold?
Las Vegas fun isn't in his plans, he's doing a personal interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have a bad feeling", he says.
"It's a long way from home and I don't have a job there yet".
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he got his dream job as an event manager in a snap, maybe it's a good sign", says the young man and smiles.
Because of the poor prospects at home, two of the three Tanners brothers have already sought their fortune abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin is currently working as an IT consultant in London.
The young people go: "There are many families like the Tanners on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, forecast economists and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
By 2015, there were 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Forecasts are confirmed, there is a wave of migration comparable to the one the island suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly confusing for young, well-educated Irish people, for whom everything is upside down so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs to have money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the editor in droves from young emigrants, complaining that "everything is going to hell in Ireland".
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and the bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation".
"Last one to close the door".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleak future because the government is only involved in set-ups and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
"They are reducing minimum wages, but they have no strategies to get new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
Watch as your peers move from one unlisted practice to the next.
His biggest worry, he explains, is that he will have to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing".
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organises the 'WorkingAbroadExpo', a trade fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who are just starting out, working abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps towards a career", says the manager.
On their website, they show pictures of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not like working on the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For the past six months, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer to do, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction sites in Germany.
They're opening a fashion shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to pay off a loan for his house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy", he says, since it has been a long time since he first stepped on his doorstep.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, which I'm never so good at".
He laughs a little embarrassed and leaves for cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with well-kept gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, there was easy money without much question", he says.
Afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours out more hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch".
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears so often these days.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a season is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe we feel like Irish for the first time".
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple".
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
To leave the future hanging and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's worked in London for a couple of years now, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that is particularly troubling him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might degenerate into a going-away party.
"Just not too much emotion", he says and takes a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds very distressing".
"We'd rather call it a party, a walk, a very relaxed party, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games".
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows the changes in attitudes in the region to be monitored.
The results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor that prevails in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big decline in production last year.
However, only half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are staunch democrats, which is below the regional average (see chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy was functioning in practice in their country, the same as last year but considerably higher than the 25% recorded in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34% said they trusted their country's Congress and 45% their government, the same as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has declined again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Graph 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the survey began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see chart 5).
About 31% say they or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the past year, down from 38% last year and the lowest percentage since 1995.
The more positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared to only 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% from 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered the most influential by those surveyed in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the scrap heap
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they fared much worse than foreigners who try to help the country recover from its problems feared.
Votes were inserted into the ballot boxes, some people voted several times, ballots were thrown into the sewers, polling stations were destroyed and acts of intimidation were carried out.
The polling stations opened late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering the area trying to figure out where they were supposed to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking UN official in Haiti, declared that it was "a relatively good election in many ways".
The observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautioned that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show must go on.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tie-breaker is expected to take place in January.
All hope is not yet lost in the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial petition seeking the vote to be invalidated.
But problems may still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has passed to the second round.
Considering the cholera epidemic sweeping the country and over a million of earthquake survivors still living in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were unable to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government an essential step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And, as it turns out, so do the Haitians themselves.
Tipping forward to the center
In the weeks since losing her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great deal of public sympathy that has increased her popularity by 20 points to over 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
However, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of making budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their discretion.
In theory, Ms Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the ruling Peronist movement have confronted Ms. Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be carried over to next year, giving the President even more leeway to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: it's likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the union wage demands, put it at close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, he put pressure on the private sector and he had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now moderate these policies?
He's called meetings between the private sector and the union leaders.
In addition, officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth boost achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernandez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernandez is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Club of Paris, to which she owes some 6,700 million dollars.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve the IMF's supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to continue in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband at her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she'll have to decide whether or not to repudiate, with a calm voice, many of her husband's policies.
Halfway to China
Taiwan's voters are slowly moving towards a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, turned out on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors of five urban districts in what appears to be a wide-ranging assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a champion of the continent's feelings, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by a narrow margin.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been leaning towards full independence for Taiwan, won practically 50% of all votes against 45% for the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the city council.
The election featured the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with banners and light-clothed girls dancing.
Nor was the mysterious attempted murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or to take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue was not the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat from China.
As a result, the KMT usually avoids publicising its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PDP avoided stirring up anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma claimed that it had been confirmed that his policy towards China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would also like to see political integration, but first things first.
It's best to wait until after the 2012 presidential election to do so.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly encouraged explicit independence.
However, under Ms. Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is making efforts to attract professionals and youth.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as the PDP's presidential candidate, as has Ms. Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his jail cell, he claimed that the PPD candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the PPD will have a hard time choosing among their potential candidates.
The KMT must also make an examination of conscience.
Mr. Ma's ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be due mainly to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman claims that he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples of the DPP suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of breakthrough artist.
Act at the request of a president and people will probably notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprise winners of this year's Grammys with a high-profile nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Considering that Spalding has been a highly acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination is thought-provoking, but it respects the Grammys' rules that an artist must not have released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was certainly a breakthrough, and given her light and pleasing vocal style, as well as a great ability with pop, funk and Latin rhythms influences, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to Norah Jones' 2003 hit, the closest equivalent for voters of the Grammys, who have lately concentrated on the jazz realm for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightfully honored "Historicity" by the Vijay Iyer Trio, a thrilling and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a favorite New Orleans striker and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as on albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's wild punk band Secret Society earned a well-deserved spot in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risky Dave Holland, whose live album with its octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for best direction of classical albums
The classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mixture of musicians and songwriters from around the world.
The top nominations went to Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra in three movements.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The category for Classic Producer of the Year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for the Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti", and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for solo instrumental performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
The instrumental soloists nominated include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Proposed Temecula mosque gets approval from the planning commission
The mosque project for Temecula has won the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project as promoting terrorism and traffic jams.
However, the committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local law and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, whether Christians or Jews or Baha'is, from all religions", said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud of it".
"It proves that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal", he adds.
"They just talk too loudly".
"There are wonderful people in this valley".
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight; most of the time was spent with people who were advocating for or against the center, about the same number on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists", reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Lady Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
Plans to build Islamic centers have sparked protests in other parts of the country as well, including near the ground zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Valley of Temecula, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has reported acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families had been living together without problems in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32 acre site on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
A resistant microbe to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients widens the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it proves that life may be possible without the major elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can grow on either phosphorus or arsenic".
"That makes it very peculiar, though it is close to being a truly 'alien' type of life form", said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, it was thought that there were six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
Anbar said the find is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to power their biochemistry and that the set of 'standard' elements we consider essential for life may not be as fixed", said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", added Cockell.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute for Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute for one another.
"Arsenic is toxic primarily because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate between them".
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it gets in and, in a way, it stunts the biochemical machinery", explains Anbar.
The researchers took the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, to which they were able to adapt and use to grow.
The microbe grows best on phosphorus, but the fact that it can live on arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may naturally exist, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but that no example has ever been found that works.
Arsenic was more common in the earliest ages of Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there could be other ways of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in ancient times", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs from Compton have been found.
The two missing dogs from the four that were stolen have been found outside the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis, were reported missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in, outside the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well", said Whitmore.
"They're in good shape".
"They have returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore would not say exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say anything", said Whitmore.
"We're following some leads".
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at an animal shelter in Downey County on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek were planning to show off at the local dog show this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing as of Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and they were intending to show off Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's almost two-month tour of dog races.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right outside their bedroom window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer cub, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen Tuesday morning at 6:00 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday, it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as the MGM restructuring gets final court approval.
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the plan "pre-armed" by creditors to wipe out approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no further legal obstacles to MGM relaunching under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a scaled-down studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM won't even get out of Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit facility to fund the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which is itself contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The firm's restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide management advice needed to put its finances in order, while it struggled to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankruptcy recovery expert known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial woes and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale in late 2009.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
By spring of this year, he was back at the drawing board as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and has assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films set to come out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to take out a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance its gift budget
While the iPad is the leading contender to be this year's most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect gaming system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to balance your gift budget.
I recently visited three national toy stores, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's tech toy will probably have more power, cost the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button-battery-powered toys are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and up) are stuffed toys the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when their bellies are clenched.
One squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to make a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to squeeze, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and up) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic dummy plays turn-switching games like Simom Dice, and can do the moonwalk, thanks to its innovative articulated wheeled feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, though their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting exercise book.
If you are reluctant to give your child a smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3-8 years), it is the first major upgrade in the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter display.
Neither version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30 Hasbro, for 8 and up) is a game of five blocks barely bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to put words together by putting the blocks in a row before time runs out; it's formidable for an impromptu word-making competition.
More and more toys are having some kind of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credit at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates on wheels or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the piggyback on your toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest in a line of button-battery-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of policing is promoted in China
As an urban drill sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a town square, sternly inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of the chengguan, China's stout urban police, feared and despised for their capricious forceful measures and their penchant for violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of onlookers.
"Signed it!"
"Watch out!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty the girls are!"
Four girls barely past their teens with identical white gloves and olive-green jackets and tight-fitting trousers to attract attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats, perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped bow ties.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance", said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"Models are cute".
More than one government has tried to clean up China's urban inspectors.
One city mandated that all new recruits have a college degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: In 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a rogue snack cart, and watched it with a constant frown for half an hour, until the street vendor collected his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, more feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to raise China's paltry respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a passerby to death after he used his cell phone to film them while they dissolved a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted online, which described how to effectively whip criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon peddler suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government", lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper called for "a really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district issued a notice for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district advertisement called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five facial features of harmony".
They had to be above average height, over 5 feet, 5 1/2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too strenuous for women over 25.
"Your image is the important thing", an unnamed district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the candidates' external qualities will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then comes temperament "and the qualities within".
Women Chengguan are like florists, he said, adding, "besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district's city administration office, is not eager to back that description.
But she noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
Whether this means being handsome is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely the handicapped or disfigured should not be introduced.
"We cannot allow a lame person or a hunchback to come to work here", Mr. Zheng said.
"His image would not be good".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with her colorful cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her look is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a sardonic look.
His fellow worker with dimples, Xu Yang, 21, said, "Our work should present the image of the city".
They are also not opposed to their time-limited work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply chasing salesmen off the back roads where they are supposed to do business.
Every morning, the squad faces more or less a dozen street vendors who launch themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many rolls or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave".
"We have told you many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn wagon with noodle trimmings.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or less the same thing every day", said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in her spare time.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after a false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen police or chengguan officers were injured in the overnight episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two streets away from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where the female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by regulations.
The motorcycle owner was shouting roughly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad attitude, elbowed their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned over to hide his name.
Like the female officers, the coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain a stylish image.
"We sometimes fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said quite naturally.
"Most of the time it's the audience that starts the fight".
The prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign.
The senator's attorneys announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have exonerated Senator John Ensign of criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman's husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to bring charges against him in this matter".
The Justice Department would not comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
The interviews, email and other documents first leaked in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, to obtain lucrative work by lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer on an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign aide, he was barred by law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to be at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to conduct personal business.
From the evidence that has come to light, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute", said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients under government investigation.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don't apply to them", he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor from the Justice Department on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department didn't want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment by Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which got the job through lobbying thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign chief of staff John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him he was "slashing" the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first broke last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the lead of the Justice Department and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is eager to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada", he said.
Cheshire appeal to target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chattering" in the courtroom lines.
Minute by minute, they sent out reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 tweets about the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of murdering three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, is set to come to an official end, with the judge imposing the death penalty as voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' attorneys have filed court briefs outlining the arguments of the appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reporting on the trial, including the extensive use of Twitter by mainstream media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force the appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"From what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for Mr. Hayes' defense.
Chief Justice Jon C. Blue of the state's Superior Court, laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland osteopath Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the trial" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime was inspired by the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that considered Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtroom, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes' attorneys, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test potential jurors' reactions by showing them creepy crime-scene photographs during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and contend that the judge incorrectly removed a juror who had criticized prosecutors, and who had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the juror to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the trial may attract most of the interest.
They noted in an appeal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually fanned the fire of emotion about the case.
"The daily clash of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom", the lawyers wrote, "was something unseen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state".
His focus on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a Luddite view that would make the court's policy on controlling coverage weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often attracted by arguments about the adaptation that was required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' attorneys are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century".
Can civility bridge the divides?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a little civility has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a swift return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the big issues that should be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion of the differences between the two sides, as well as an acknowledgement of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to gain partisan points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the chairman's deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a testing period, probing each other for signs of cooperativism and compromise, as they try to gauge the limits of public opinion and voter patience for renewed partisan warfare.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid change of climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, spending, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no question that things have changed with regard to the way things are said", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
Elections stir up partisan passions, which then go out.
That's good".
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda for the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and nobody's in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a compromise to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make it seem like they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits for the unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is increased optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues in the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said that the beginning of a period of disagreement was very likely and even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation in the short term", he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to genuine cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012", he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of overstating their position, they know they must try to deliver on their promises to cut state spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own estimation, have forced the deficit issue onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they've been struggling to get anywhere near that number.
The biggest resistance is among elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on tax issues there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama over the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as it did in 1995, then both parties will watch closely for the reaction of the people.
Whoever they consider to be losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as merely the prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a corruption haven
The city is controlled by a "cleptocracy", and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service were reported to operate huge blackmail schemes, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized crime groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority", takes its share as money climbs the ladder.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a clean-up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel suits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian TV channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he claimed: "It's crazy, it's bullshit, it's a nuisance".
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it's unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it's unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
"The Moscow city government's direct links to criminality have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government", the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means 'roof' or protection) that permeates the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is on top".
"The SFS, MVD and militia are on the second level".
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level".
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city doesn't provide some services".
The report claims that the SFS collects money from the largest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminal groups, but are also protected by the law".
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority".
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be patchy; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay promptly find their businesses shut down on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow-based Indem think tank, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy".
"He doesn't belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia".
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US Embassy memo, which did not occur until late night Moscow time, is sure to cause upset within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents might be lies and reacted angrily to a revelation that claimed that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic politics in this country", he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would be done in such an immoral way".
The Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with walls stained and peeled, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people", said Mr. Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed UN-Cambodian court handed down the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Anlong Veng Khmer Rouge veterans, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"This is creating divisions within families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died from hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the Khmer Rouge's most senior fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the rank-and-file soldiers remained poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gotten little benefit after the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have embodied the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They were raised with no concept of doing business".
Lim Sor, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before devoting himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok fed the whole family".
"But now life is hard because we have to provide for ourselves".
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it hasn't said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This did little to allay fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
On a recent sullen afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden stilts on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to speak of her Khmer Rouge past.
She claimed that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable", he stated.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, though experts and historians question this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is putting the broken pieces back together", he said.
"It is our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand".
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages long.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's secondary school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But her parents reacted skeptically when she brought the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court", he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure about how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too much weed and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black soot rectangle covered by a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone salesman, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she decided to walk to the final resting place of Pol Pot, where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to retrieve 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the Obama-chaired 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This shows that this process is working", said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide for the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have preserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not manufacture dirty bombs, and we will not sell them to anyone".
"We use it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching a deal.
Officials claimed that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled over 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by air.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the research facility for low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy who works on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to build the trust" that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential detente.
It stated that 'while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens.'
The Spanish government didn't object to the CIA's flights.
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA's flights of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay via Spanish territory, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign aircraft that cross Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report 'had caught the Zapatero Government out of the game' and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unprepared for the attack", Aguirre said in a cable.
The then Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to keep this matter as low as possible, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information", the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern over the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments", laments Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid inflammatory rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's performance in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the US that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government", he points out.
The parricide confessed that she complained on the network about the "strain" of being a mother
The young woman spoke about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she has used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coruña town from which she is native.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through the testimonies of their relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
Soon, she was dating someone else.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring town.
He lived with him for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it's clear that their romance fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and mosquito, because I have come to work".
"When I told him he seemed fine, but of course, now he realizes what it is to be with the child all day and not to have freedom to do what he wants".
Then, she talks about a text message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you back this month or give me an address to send the kid to you".
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll pick it up when I get back", she says.

The Popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced members in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP has already set its sights on the general elections, because, whether it advances or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles that received in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 regional elections, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won with 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been fueled by a shift of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, is maintained, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the Populars, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would keep one deputy or gain one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in his relay at the head of the Barcelona Province, one of the administrations that manages more budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree that the PSC could lose the Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona town councils, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this group to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - 5% of the votes are needed.
The PP has increased its vote in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the overthrow in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has placed itself only 500 votes behind the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
Popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, there were three arrested in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the Police Information Directorate in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with the "Kampai operation" the Al Qaeda's international counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" and "therefore its operational capacity".
The researchers estimate that in the two years that the cell has been active in Catalonia, it has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operative in Europe, hence that in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU will be carried out in the coming days similar to the coup developed last night Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who directed the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - was stealing mainly from tourists passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigation media stress that, for the moment, no data has been found linking the arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, although the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through an agency of transfers about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile phone cards that were later used by the members of the "commando" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized a large quantity of documents.
The PP demands that Mas stop the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and disregarding pro-sovereignty adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The Catalan Popular Party president came to Artur Mas's meeting with the confidence that he had won 18 seats in last Sunday's elections, a figure more than enough to make him desirable, as the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition parties to abstain in the investiture vote.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but, for the moment, the talks that Mas is holding these days with the rest of the political leaders are being held in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "all sovereigntist and independence-seeking speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
The two leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on Mas's investiture will be handled by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat on behalf of the PPC.
The Commissioner has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home claims the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center don't rule out that their jailer killed over 11 elderly people.
The responsible for the geriatric La Caritat of Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage that has caused the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was employed there killed at least eleven elders who had in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lecturer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil liability".
And besides the social disrepute that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the celador, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that is already being calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime was committed in August 2009 and that since then she has not stopped killing.
The judge already noted in the auto ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but that, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was expedited by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday categorically denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
Lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself".
The man known as "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and said that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and then, a month and a half later, killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with the help of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control the access of the staff to the medicines.
Insulin injections and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine murders that the orderly, in his eagerness to relieve the inmates' suffering, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them from within by giving them lejía as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In Caritat do not give credibility to the manifestations of the celador, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that has given Vila in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That's why they say they're putting themselves at the disposal of the justice system to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and European bank stocks have risen by over 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB's capacity to make mistakes either, and the euro has barely recovered, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market which just as it collapses recovers but is motivated by closing short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time to get over his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the public debt purchase plan be terminated as ineffective and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be abolished at maturity, leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures 'at least until March' and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue their bond-buying programme and even to signal an intensification.
If they do not live up to the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, may God help us!
As in their meeting in May where they claimed that they had not even contemplated the purchase of bonds and the markets collapsed, tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazuca on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market slump.
Yesterday's auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15 billion potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the new EU-wide rules on the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of the Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
There's a key auction today of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we're hoping that will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain to ask for a bailout would be self-immolation.
They'd give us a liquidity line we don't need, the Treasury has over 40 billion in liquidity available, triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you off to the markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of the wife of the Caesar, "in addition to being, to appear".
Come on, we can do this.
The president of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicilia board requested by his children
The storm is not letting up in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "nula de pleno derecho", the judicial board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria Jose are fine-tuning the legal drums for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem willing to give up his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
The board of directors was headed by five of his seven sons who were appointed as directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year and whose challenge is noted in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, summoned by the magistrate of Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunders in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the meeting is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the applicants their five children to, through procedural arguia, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to convalidate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18", according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the Board, once convened, to proceed with its challenge, considering it to be "null and void".
The same actors, who are keeping a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a company holding and holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, however, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the main issue to be decided by the judge after the hearing on the challenge, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs upgrades to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull burst into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been one of surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship, everyone bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without diminishing the skill of the eventual champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high-level car competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing tool has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, simulate in a faithful way the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi airplanes and the most famous Nissan commercial cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division at Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 engineers on their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four upgrades to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and design all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all the elements of Red Bull cars except for the engine, which is the responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be made from virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological perfection is the $40 million figure that each Formula 1 team can spend at most each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its carriages in a town about 30 miles from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The roster for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists are hidden whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety is null.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in buggy cars accounted for 50% of the victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer technology because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of a network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational company plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the refurbished shop on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish outlets.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being third.
Herrero did not reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also said that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and designs the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP provides training for the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, attention, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pilot program pioneer worldwide that is responsible for solving possible problems of computer equipment HP in guarantee.
An online service connects you to a technical centre in Maastricht (the Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days".
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services", remarked Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on 'stealing' a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially ruled out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of the liabilities.
However, it foresees a fall in interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to attract a million private clients in three years, his unfinished business.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, besides surviving without having to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, their great pending subject, since until now it had pampered more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 corporate customers.
Its market share in private individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks dare these days to set goals and make them public since the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell will in fact close this year its Optima master plan, which was set up four years ago, although it was initially for three years, but the situation on the markets meant that it will be extended for another year.
The clients who let the savings banks escape will be their main target.
At a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And although he believes that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is decreasing, the price of the risk premiums that banks and credit unions are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and funding issue is structural, and it's going to be a factor of pressure on credit".
"We haven't closed the tap, but the spreads are higher", Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads -see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also acknowledged that the trend of the bank now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not without reason that he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
"Next year everything will be moved", he said.
He said capital needs were "very high" and did not rule out the possibility of a Spanish financial institution being in the red.
The Commission notes that the FROB can provide the market with funds to finance new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, it can obtain short-term financing through repos, which dampens the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the cash-flow
The general director of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being executed.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think that the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Banca Civica group can not be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments".
"The majority of the work is complete; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has also collaborated a lot in that", the manager said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is being committed "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the terms that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million in assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is remembering that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The ECSC's director general, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and blamed those who questioned it for a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banks had performed very well in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Slipper and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
The market tensions have provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the removal of the 426 euros of unemployment aid without provision, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
The European Parliament has voted to approve the new Commission proposal on the protection of the environment and the environment from harmful substances.
How are you supposed to interpret those moves?
It is clear that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the South would leave the monetary zone.
Secondly, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines for offending countries, possible suspension of payments by some of them and the extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany believed should be done (tax austerity plans and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully prolonged the decision to bail out Greece.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were strongly against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat watered down, has been adopted and in the coming months we should be witnessing the process of reform of the Union which will make those measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it will not cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take steps with which he may not agree, from that date the old way of working the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offending countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must pursue a tough growth path with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, is simply not going to be tolerated.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand that.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they're asking of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will give way to greater calm.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity that we've been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, the thesis that we must put order at home has been opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't look like it's going to be moved.
And the possibility of leaving a monetary area too full of unserious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it had already warned us.
Sports and Law Fraud
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The allegedly horrendous expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 Champions League match against Ajax has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behaviour is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes to go to the end of the match (which their team had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they took out both fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can go clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos, the unwritten, but followed, rules of this sport.
Part of the debate arising in the case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem presumes nobility and honor, and that in past occasions has fined its players for analogous acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long technical history of histrionic and provocative.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the rules is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are fraudulent; indeed, they are actions respectful of the sporting rules, but they seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they do to sportsmanship.
One of the goods that comprises the sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the players opposite, aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which fair play refers is to prevent the team of offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not accommodate themselves to what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious so as to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is what kind of advantage the offenders get in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the opponent is not placed in a disadvantageous situation or that a profit is obtained in the same match, since the result of the action evidently implies leaving the team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players meet a match of sanction and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going round and round, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, such actions do not go against the spirit of the game, which is part of making strategic decisions that favor getting the most out of what the rules allow.
In the present case, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud of the law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and law-breaking is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I believe, arises from two factors: because there were two self-evictions and because of the way in which the directive to bring about them was transmitted.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive bidding to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar is concentrating a flood of reserves this year for the 16th and 17th.
Self-supported celebrations are proliferating, with employees wanting to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, agree the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complicate the accounting, this year's calendar (when Christmas Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the petitions on the week of December 13, with the result to date of a flood of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and hardly any movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean cow phase began, many companies have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To keep up with the tradition, many workers pay for it out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, some are demanding battle-priced items, says the president of the Barcelona Restoration Association, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers' association, to this day, does not dare to predict how the celebrations of this month will be.
"People think long and hard before they book".
"He wants to go out but he has the price alerts on", he says.
The business will do well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a flight of stairs with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey of several central establishments shows a collapse in petitions by the evening of the 17th.
The Soteras group says there's a real boom in requests for that Friday, with the pretension of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance reservations, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done our best to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they say.
In Grup, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second half and a good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources in the group stress that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that are inviting their employees back and feeling that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On behalf of the Fecasarm employers' association (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, hopes to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall the reserves are "animated", although customers "trade to the max".
Yes, the enthusiasm for the festivities has not gone down, pay whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a rate faster than any other country".
The Wikileaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirm the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and juicy details of the content of the talks and the thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, instead of increasing, is "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled but stored in components to make it harder to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the Washington alarm.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones, lists: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under attack by the Taliban, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the US but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to be on guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work on nuclear or missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The most novel of the documents leaked by Julian Assange's portal is the decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high pace of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, calling communication with Pakistan "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often lacking; offers of help are unanswered or dismissed".
In another tweet, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it's hard to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, it's dated November 20th.
And it's not about the latest leak of over a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but about the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was on the 20th when the international police body based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
As it is, all 188 Interpol countries have indication of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called red notice a free way to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police body, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has angered Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has shown willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, whom they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter says.
While the world is searching for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange remains unaccounted for, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an undisclosed interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign", he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a top counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with the views being voiced by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House Homeland Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to consider putting WikiLeaks on the terrorist list "to intervene and fund it and prosecute anyone who gives it any input or help".
Furthermore, Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to backtrack after saying that Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something".
The one who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible candidate for president.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything but execution would be a too-kind punishment", he declared on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to the Carod kinsmen
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to avoid the umpteenth internal revolt in the ERC ranks, with the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The party president is aware that his amago of resignation is insufficient for those who are related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can absolutely cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
The leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winking that will allow him to arm until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of the ERC will be able to decide on its continuation in secret.
By ballot, not by show of hands.
If the carodians want to deliver a certain vow of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the rank-and-file leader wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be good a result "to the Bulgarian".
Those close to Carod demand that the president do more than make his position available to the militancia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But since they don't have a majority to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive a road map between now and May.
To do so, they hope to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the national council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to move the congress forward to the autumn of 2011, something that the top leadership already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and that his goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash the dirty rags from doors in.
In this line, the article that the acting minister Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considering Puigcercós' ideologist, the head of Innovació took it for granted that the leader would be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "re-compose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the membership, that is, to include new faces from the sector related to Carod.
The second one might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should abolish assemblyism as a mechanism of operation.
It therefore advocates a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held by delegates elected by suffrage.
The end of the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task of revising the assembly in a specific congress of statutes reform to the leadership.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years has made it advisable not to tackle the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to take it back and try to shut it down for good.

China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China is sticking to its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives but would continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas there have been progress, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the state and local authorities to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, there are a number of multiannual plans, funded by the Chinese government and other governments, which are either underway or have already been completed.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been implemented for the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations Organization (UN), the government and the private sector.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent bulbs for savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than what is generally thought.
For example, he pointed out, China's per capita emissions of greenhouse gases are six tons per person, while the United States' is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020, he said.
The law enforcement has expelled Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN said that the former leader of the panist is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order of Sonora Commission".
"Mr. Espino has the right to complain to the National Council's Committee on Rules of Procedure, as this is a decision taken by a competent body", he said.
He also said that it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional will emerge strengthened from the internal election on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a approach for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective", he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and strengthen us", he said.
He said that the council will certainly know how to choose the best leader that National Action needs for the next three years, hence he will hand over the relay "to whom the council determines".
"I have that absolute calm and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of party president".
He predicted that the party's upswing in the July 4 elections would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012 yet".
"For now, we are trying to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanated from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on priests to reflect on the sexenios of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that he come out of the closet", he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive could make statements like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no gagging in the country, much less censorship.
Obama promotes on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and get them to pass this legislation", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation", Obama tweeted.
His brief message maintains an open cyberlink to a broader document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to make your voice heard", he notes.
The message was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless Bush-era tax cuts and government funding are extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time...
"We all agree that we have to resolve the fiscal issue before the end of the year... "
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closure vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it's more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have been in the country for the past five years, and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the bill, which requires the help of a handful of Republicans, as pro-project organizations are engaged in intense lobbying to ensure passage of the bill.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why the Dream Act supporters are calling for a number of Republicans to join them in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the bill.
Among the most courted Republicans are the Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not support it in the future.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
While the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put the finger in the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where the participants performed the narration.
"That of the sex in the tongue I understand but ... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the Pleasures of the tongue, cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of his question table (in another fair the round was dedicated to the sex in the tongue, he explained).
The finger in the sore... "puts us in a tight spot", the Argentine writer sweetly spat to the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "laga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectious disease specialist says, "Patience is not my strong point, maybe it's my weak point".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has taken his breath in the middle of the hall, but who clarifies that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must go very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative entitled Invention of the Invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but in a moment is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or regained the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to talk later America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning its own chroniclers to tell it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the captains conquerors.
"Cervantes invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise we would never have gotten to tell the story of America with imagination that lacked even the modesty".
However, he stressed "it is the mad and the impostors who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
He calls it the "cervantine tradition".
"By his inheritance we are what counts".
In turn, the writer Mayra Montero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger in the sore gave rise to.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed his finger at the great scourge of social violence that is sweeping his country - and Latin America - as a result of the disputes over the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated", he said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the writer's wound committed to the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our thinking and the masters of reality, we have to nuance: and nuance often means to put the finger on the wound and to disturb those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white", he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a marked contrast by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although until now he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoled with the medal of the runner-up, he has stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with which he lost by a 4-2 score to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clausura also reached the decisive match and also lost with a 3-1 score and it was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback, as his team finished tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he took advantage by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the voltereta 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the spell and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the most important is the institution.
"I want to win, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe and therefore the title will come for me, but the above is the most important", commented the helmsman when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very much has the previous final, from which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are ready on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already prepared to run out and I think that is a lesson, until the game is not over we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shots, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never seek to reach the penalty shootout, you seek to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move the fate, sometimes because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it went away, that left us something for this final that we hope does not reach that instance".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up technician and to taste for the first time the glory that titles give.
US changes rules for visa
Individuals should go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres before their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and so will the waiting time.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa application procedure at the US Embassy and consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service (ASC) before their interview at the Consular Section.
The applicant's biometric information will be taken by the ASC staff, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer will it be necessary to make a payment for arranging the appointment, another payment for processing the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-off payment covering all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa-on-demand cases (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second interview appointment at the Consular Section will be in the Consular Section for a shorter time than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26 USD.
The new visa application procedure is available at http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html for further information on the new visa application procedure.
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has called the press to report tomorrow on a finding that will have a major impact on the search for life in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The findings will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the study of the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and it would put on the table the possibility that they could become intelligent beings like us if the conditions in which they live were improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Monkey Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any life form, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and this ability raises the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will prove that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will reveal the true scope of the findings at a press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and opposing 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisism' in the Chamber.
Before the start of the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throneed' against the reform to the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, the 'bipartisanship' is beginning, because now it will be two people, from the same number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Executive Board, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, said that with these reforms in an institutional way, the political marginality of the PRI and PAN is constituted.
He said that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be avasalled again by both parties and with that the opposition coalition is over.
"So far has it come (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded, from any decision, nor do they have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States that have not yet ratified the Convention.
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipedalism in Congress".
To start with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other comrades to be more, the convergent said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a 'booty' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"It used to be just one party, now they're splitting it between two".
Patrón Montalvo, asked that the deputy's personality be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating table.
"That not by cupular agreements, leave out 5 that we probably go to make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they did that they agreed, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform".
$200,000 more for "the provider"
Pays Mazatlan City another check to the questionable owner of an electrical equipment company.
A check for more than 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the company of electrical equipment, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Auditor of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total amount still owed and, therefore, how many more checks are still to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, it is simply being paid what it is due, just like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last one on 16 November.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as the law states when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
The previous, after that on July 25, Noroeste published a review to the checks that the City issues to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also conducted transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgently attending tourist sites
Tourist businessmen lament the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Commercialists of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination should be taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to stroll and see the disorder and turn away from nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business one day and have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they wouldn't have done the work in this way in such a long time and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to take responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it by providing preventive maintenance and not falling solely into the corrective", he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only as a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well".
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, for tourists to come, it's not just about the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, in its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are tourist attractions", he said.
"The proper attention has not been paid and this kind of fact shows something that is known by all, maintenance is needed".
Raúl Llera Martínez, the undersecretary for Tourism Promotion, said that it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlán, as they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that it is attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we will have to first sort, clean and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination".
IP asks for results from Congress
Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of worthy work and free of agreements between parties and the state Executive is demanded by the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa facing great problems.
The 60th legislature was installed yesterday, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which totals 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment with society and with the different sectors that require a responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly appointed 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary to make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival companions of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary fractions".
That's why he said they should certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to get the Governor on the job.
"We urge them to come and do a worthy job and above all to be committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and sum forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will encourage job creation".
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight to revise within the state budget to strengthen the state Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the smallest budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity and generator of foreign currency and investment and that directly competes with the agro industry".
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for tourist projects that detonate and that help to give security to the state and in the update to the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A wizard king is sought
Dolls, carts and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the coming King's Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live by day because the father has no steady job.
"Sometimes we have a hard time because my husband doesn't have a cigarette, but we sell mandarin and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, aged 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, aged 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster' car, and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothing for a year.
"He said (José Alfredo), 'I'd like this monster,' but I said 'let's go see son,' because it was very expensive", Cayetana remembered sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
11-year-old Maria Guadalupe is a size 12, Isaiah, 10, is a size 10, and 8-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing his tennis shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be a great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for a Magician King", donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen prosecutions were carried out in connection with the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized", says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security.
In total, 11 men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged ringleaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession with intent to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a long investigation that has lasted for about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests", Mr Ruel said.
About seventy officers from the Estrie investigation module of the Quebec Security, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department were involved in this police operation.
It will be possible to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should solve the problem of migrant-laden beds, is likely to face strong opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the letter".
"I'm here with a party that has created the pebble you're treading on", declared Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for the detention of up to one year of anyone who comes from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government does", Mr Duceppe declared.
The NDP's critic on immigration, Olivia Chow, has flatly rejected criticism that her party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree that action should be taken against those in charge of the asylum seekers' shelters and that is what we are aiming for with another bill, Bill C-35", Ms Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year", Ms Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the position parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a doormat".
"They are expecting Canada to take firm action", Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request the holding of a vote so that each deputy who is going to oppose will explain himself later to his voters.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest was announced, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea was not raised two days ago: Quebec has been consulting the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that this measure was never discussed at a meeting of the Standing Council on the police services of Quebec on 29 October, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic who deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of the bottle" and "a last-minute, haphazard solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it", he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem".
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launching of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest tries to avoid the creation of this committee of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign", explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the provision of information on the use of the euro.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor-general", he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the interventor the same powers as a police commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest Government.
It also calls on Ottawa to amend the Quebec Penal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request appears to have been made by the prosecutor in charge of the Marteau operation, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case-law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently leaning towards making certain amendments on this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to the motorcycle groups, 131 people were arrested, even if the Criminal Code had not been adapted.
Ottawa subsequently pushed for the passage of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Various waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precautionary measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, between 20 and 40 millimeters more are expected between now and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these rains add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain areas, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the civil security unit of Quebec issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentians, and the Chêne in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed away a temporary bridge.
As a precaution, ten residences have been evacuated.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit is still on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, according to Annik Bouchard, the security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center, meanwhile, issued announcements Wednesday reporting heavy flooding from several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They partly blame Dupont.
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback at the Canadian Council of Radio and Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for his foul language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and foul language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who have committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made in broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must report reliable and not misleading data.
In connection with the suicide, the defendant Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the contested episodes of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive subject in an equitable and appropriate manner".
Therefore, any blame in this regard has been dismissed.
The latest dispute concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been the protagonists of a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The CHOI host stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of the Haitian people.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there".
"My record has been clean for a year and a half", the presenter declared.
In all its decisions, the Committee denounces the use of foul language.
In any case, CHOI-FM radio has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences for the broadcaster will be minimal, since it will have to announce the decisions once during prime time within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
Montreal's Algerian born Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs the tatami mats and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria", explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the ground game that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America".
The athlete, who works as a security guard and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the kickboxing full contact and thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of San Shou in China".
"They will invite the athletes who have finished in the top four places in the last world championship in each category".
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place".
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009", he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been progressing in each competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San Shou or Sanda is a Chinese martial art that involves striking with the fists and feet, as well as throwing opponents to the ground.
The matches are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has one competition left in his career, he will definitely attend the big tournament "King of Sanda", the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This is the most famous and prestigious competition in China", explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand) ".
"It's been an amazing experience".
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The guy who beat me is a real pro", he says.
"There are four competitors per weight class (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)".
"The winners of the semifinals will face each other in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu".
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth USD 450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this flood of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the largest contract, the project management contract, for a total of 295 million, without a prior tender.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this major US$5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
The Quebec Party believes that the use of consortia of firms raises a serious ethical problem which threatens to eliminate competition and to raise prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition".
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly", declared yesterday the deputy of the Quebec Party Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr Simard raised the matter in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was any collusion with this contract.
"I'm beginning to tire of it", he protested, saying that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "lack rigidity".
He said that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of the consortiums is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a partnership with a time limit which allows two or more firms to pool their expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is a highly complex project, given the scale of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract was awarded without any competition being involved; it was a negotiated procedure.
In addition, the consortium formula is no longer the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick glance at the Quebec Commercial Register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that 'the James Bay area responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s'.
The head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which highlighted the fact that the project management contract had been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a bidding and there are few participants, your prices will be higher".
"You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price".
"The idea is that what matters is not price, but competition from people", Mr Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth over $ 50,000 obtained by the Parti québecois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the amount of the compensation for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2010.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the contract of Énergie gérance of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has indicated that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are 'well known to the Quebec Liberal Party'.
Minister Normandeau has let slip that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about its leaders.
The 'green' label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, fair trade brands or eco-certificates to guide their choices.
The situation is even worse according to the first results of the Barometer on Responsible Consumption, which was published yesterday: the consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages are flooding in in defence of a more responsible consumption, but he regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this information even hinders his commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or their ecological advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that bear the products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands that bear labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", notes the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take seriously the speeches of politicians on this issue.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, which is currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the doubtful nature of the information make 46% of consumers give up this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebeckers say they are also suspicious of the supposed returns of the ecological products or services that are being sold to them.
Moreover, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in stores in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food products grown in their region, notes Barómetro.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to take the place of the recycling king who tries to reduce his impact on the environment by caring for the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be out of the way (from their car): in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this wide-ranging behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of cycling and walking.
A loan to the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the rehabilitation of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which had been hoping for a grant of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back the eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent from Daniel Langlois and to return him to his true cinéphilo vocation, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan, the amount of which would in fact be lower than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution on favourable terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
The Commission has already rejected a first action plan and a request for 12.8 million last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
The President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to the Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation should be completely dismissed.
The Association des propriétaires de salles et complexes de cinémas du Québec opposed direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, as it has not done with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do call for considerable financial support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, has been carrying the burden of the author's cinema in his premises in the complex for ten years, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent cinemas was evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are also pushing ahead with a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these cinemas, the Parallèle, continues to show films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals for reductions they have received.
The veil of Canada's complex is lifted...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the US sees as the complex of Canadians with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter's feeling of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-US relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government get its 2009 budget passed!
The four new communications between the US embassies in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer more juicy details than substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, during the midst of the federal election campaign, tells how the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This came as a big surprise to the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex practically inherent in Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
Thus, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about".
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting".
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the February vote of confidence in the federal budget, in which Canada will run a deficit for the first time in a decade due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan", Mr. Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue Parliament before Christmas to avoid being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties were conditioning their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington of the increasingly negative image of drama series broadcast on the CBC in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the abductions for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe would be willing to take in some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied that it was, but that it depended on "the individual case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The Secretary has agreed to review the file".
Finally, we can mention that there has been a heated debate about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass leak should be "killed".
In the United States, they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be carried out to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolise between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's equivalent to 70% of the planet's car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this quantity should be reduced to stabilise the temperature rise by two degrees Celsius by 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95 percent of the energy is dissipated as heat, and the rest, or 5 percent, is produced as light.
In the case of fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by a further twofold.
Fluorescent bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company which also took part in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives us an idea of the savings that could be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also run on rheostats and emit very little heat.
On top of that, they don't contain any mercury.
Various experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluorescent bulbs but coal-fired power plants, which emit large amounts of mercury to produce the electricity that is spilled by incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would bring to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity and 8 million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations that would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire to be published "immediately" as the deadline has expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately", a spokesman for the UN chief said.
'It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let Wednesday's deadline pass at midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had commented on television that the commission was "still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were many requests from around the world for the IEC to finally announce the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the president of Ivory Coast, has claimed that the FN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had dissuaded the outgoing president's supporters from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any connection with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in the publication of the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday should have marked the end of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class of Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed in mainland France stands at 2.631.000.
The second quarter figures were confirmed, with 9.3% of the labour force in continental territory and 9.7% with the OCT.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 percentage points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but want to work, whether or not they are available for work in the two weeks and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
There was a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482 000 people over 50 years of age, a figure which rises to 6.6% for the DOM.
Unemployment has remained stable only among people aged 25-49, with a rate of 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste management company manager and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, is under investigation and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all questions asked by the magistrate, not ghosts".
"It is easy to persecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, but it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to send a document to the judge, before his appearance, through his lawyers, to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of his close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, all your client has done is take care of the landfills he's supposed to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
In the framework of this dossier, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the urban agglomeration services of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday, for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts of which he has been accused".
"The investigating magistrate has taken account of your explanations and has released you", explained his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the adjunct prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been accused of "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "theft and misappropriation of public property by a person engaged in public service" and for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently jailed in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their societies have a service to launder the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several judicial proceedings initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications alleging fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations are particularly focused on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss issue: the Elisha has overstated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has been a public concern in France, a diplomatic alarm and a sharp worsening of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the impression that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic cable dated 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled 'Iran: French comments on the handling of hostage cases'.
The President of the European Council, Mr Jacques Delors, and the President of the European Commission, Mr Jean-Pierre Giscard d'Estaing, met on the occasion of the opening of the European Council in Brussels.
They're explaining the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly detained in Iran.
'Make noise,' they say, 'repeatedly and continually' in the media the words 'fundamental human rights', 'innocence', 'immediate release'.
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often still".
Because, once attempts at negotiation through discreet channels are exhausted, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
It announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money from the Iranians" (230,000 euros in reward).
He also notes that the Elishev anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "is going to increase".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he says.
28 August 2009
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is stranded in Iran.
The following information is being disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge.
The US embassy, like many observers, is skeptical of this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is closing down Iran's clandestine networks of acquiring material for its nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
Elisha, he says, not only "was greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but he tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot overrule the judicial decision", he said.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, El-Elyse has spared no effort, using leaks and organized "leaks" in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation is paying off, since several press articles convey the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then goes on to discuss the reasons which led the Elysée to create this fiction.
The major communication effort 'is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria', he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy has good information.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not".
"But we thanked him anyway".
"At the very least, this should cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirio for playing an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, Korean youths can't play online
The South Korean government is to pass a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day".
"We think this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6:00 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government is also planning to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people request it, the official added.
The Commission will also make available, on request, free software which will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where they faced 58 other countries.
2018-2022: FIFA names the host countries
Amidst the storm over corruption allegations, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday named the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implantation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch governments, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Backroom transactions may therefore be held until the last minute.
It is also difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) for corruption, could have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass British officials, who have been engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to repeat the successful coup of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the London bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's splendor in the eyes of the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has many strong points thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup in Spain, World Cup in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal all they achieve is to give points to Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the British press against the EC members.
"They are pulling out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them", Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, with its 1994 experience, seems the logical favorite.
The country, the world's largest economy and home to the main sponsors of FIFA, seems to have an advantage over Japan and South Korea, which have each developed an excellent project.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that have jointly hosted the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, which is the FIFA's strong desire, would leave Asia without a chance for 2022.
Alongside Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of paid TV rights (as a function of the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted it.
Mitterrand had given the impression that he was doubtful.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less so.
One command at the Elysée leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidency.
So you always have to look like you're in doubt.
One way and the other.
In 2006, though they didn't believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends said he wouldn't rule out a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
So the fact that he is dealing with the UMP MPs, on Tuesday night in the Elysée, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused quite a stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much of a problem.
The president was merely stating that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was simply reporting the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's talked about the presidential election, in a playful tone, at meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or best, case, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me", he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, he said: "Do not think that I do not consider what will come next".
Your claims from the day before yesterday do not bring you any closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They provoke comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to come clean.
Quite the opposite; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is obvious is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized earlier than expected.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, voters on the right prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the issue in the UMP", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he will not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) in the year should enable the details of the way out of the crisis to be worked out or at least to announce the suspension of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations which should be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis means that the Frankfurt Institute cannot afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a situation which is more than complicated today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
The European Council meeting in Brussels on 21 and 22 June, in which the Commission took stock of the progress made in the implementation of the new financial framework, stressed the need to ensure that the European Union's financial institutions are able to play a full part in the implementation of the new financial framework.
He did not say whether he thought the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond-purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans"...
The President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more eloquent in his intentions at a hearing in Brussels the day before yesterday before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, saying only that the programme of buying up government bonds on the secondary market was 'continuing' and that 'we shall see what we decide' at Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main unchanged rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's purchase of Treasury bonds has doubled in the past week to around €1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscrete market operators, yesterday he bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased securities worth EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market operators that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also foresee no significant change in course.
Although the ECB's lending operations with maturities longer than three months have disappeared, it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on favourable terms for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to last for a few months.
"I don't imagine he's going to change his program substantially".
"If not, it would risk triggering new tensions in the short term", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim, you know.
With regard to interventions in the public debt market, 'the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of such bonds in order to keep the market stable', adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate at any cost for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states", a leading bond manager said yesterday.
Because if interest rates go through the roof, the states will have even more problems reducing their debt or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is able to temporarily
After Italy started the week in a disturbing fashion, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the rates of the 10-year bonds.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indescifrable" and that they expected an "unpredictable" weekend, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the spread with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk insurance contracts (CRQ) had soared to 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "the turbulence in the markets" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the euro zone's third largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to cope with its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a water cooler for the government.
Italian growth is forecast to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget currently being considered in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (compared to 2.7%).
Hence the rumour that new budgetary provisions may be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures should be adopted", said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for a long time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilisation efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries", comments Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There is the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be brought forward to the end of March.
In that case, it would open a period that would be unfavourable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening the mechanisms to fight the crisis
Christine Lagarde said it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: 'I think we have already shown on Sunday, day and night, that the Europeans are clearly united, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency area.'
The easing of European government bond rates yesterday, although relative, has given a boost to governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems", say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political pace is much slower than the market pace".
Conscious of this gap and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for overcoming the crisis.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are proceeding well.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The agenda includes the type of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) chief executive Klaus Regling began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East of developments in the European crisis.
While the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, they certainly prepare the ground.
The first issues of the EFSF's securities are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the US would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to the austerity measures with a more immediate effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to go down a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs calling for international aid before they apply their own budgetary corrections and decide on the structural reforms they consider essential to build confidence in a lasting way.
The capital partners of the European funds are also considering the options available to speed up the process of normalising the markets for government bonds.
On 24 November, Axel Weber, visiting Paris, was the first to launch the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to draw up the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of around €100 billion additional would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has €60 billion.
This is a piece of advice which European capitals could certainly examine in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 since midday Wednesday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group in the evening.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in Île de France.
Snowfall of between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, is expected in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, the Isle of France and Lemosin.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic problems and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, vehicles over 7,5 tonnes are prohibited from using several departmental roads, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that it is not driven except in case of necessity and has been prohibited the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation has been banned in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned for Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris' Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to the expected snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
The Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Isle of France has reached its climax, billions are pouring in.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we talked about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro which the Société du Grand Paris is to build.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of EUR 4,000 million.
Theoretically, this amount will then enable SGP to obtain loans on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The amending finance law of 2010, which was considered in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the provisions for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways of doing this: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices in Île-de-France.
The first, as we read in Article 15 of the text of the bill, is 'for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris'.
It is also stated in figures: "The proceeds from this tax amount to EUR 117 million a year".
The second is a modification of an existing office tax "to modernise it, increase its proceeds and allocate the increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's a long way from four billion.
"It is specified that the fiscal resources are to be added to the EUR 4 billion allocated by the State and which will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses", we read in the explanatory statement.
The G.M.S. is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment that income is created (the two taxes), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as we explained".
'It shall be entered in the budget and used as required.'
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4 billion is not included in the credit, may provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will be held on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case is a two-pronged issue.
On the one hand, it exposes an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuttings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculous profile of Gaddafi has long been giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of news that is public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a library devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who engage in occultism do not just rely on what they already know, which confirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to classified files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services is lazy (or has little desire) (if he could not be, I don't know, editor of Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same information that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why have the revelations in these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they are simply saying what every educated person knows already, namely that embassies, at least since the Second World War and since Heads of State can telephone one another or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into centres of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this well, we just pretend we don't know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could access the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world would significantly affect the State Department's prestige.
The scandal therefore affects both the victims and the "victims".
But let's get into the real nature of what happened.
In the old days, in Orwell's time, you could think of all power as a Big Brother controlling the every move of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has been fulfilled since, by being able to control every move thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it's shown, as it is now, that even the cryptos of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you stand a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to such a powerful power?
It is clear that in future, the States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the net, since it would be like putting it on a sign in the middle of the street.
But it also becomes clear that with today's technology, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has flown in and made contact with one of his counterparts.
How will you be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know that my prediction is science fiction and therefore novel, but I imagine government officials traveling discreetly on stagecoaches with uncontrollable routes, carrying messages they have memorized or, at best, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then stored, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I've written that technology is currently moving like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has created a wired telegraph (telephony) again.
Video tapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, going forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now CDs (digital) only allow one to go forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel involved, we need three and a half hours.
So it is not at all unusual that politics and communication techniques lead us back to the horse-drawn carriages.
One last note.
In the old days, the press tried to understand what was going on in the embassies.
Today, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: French funding promises are in tatters
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the promises of rapidly unblocked financing (called fast start or precoces) made by the developed countries have been respected.
And the French screw-ups have been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to providing 7.2 billion euro over three years and France 1.260 billion euro (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU put its best cards on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is real: a report detailing the measures taken by its Member States, a press conference, a major side event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was appreciated and appreciated for what it's really worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
The Copenhagen Accord calls for money to be 'new and additional' to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, each person chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added over three years as a fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks for the year or level of official development assistance.
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any evidence that the aid was granted in the form of a loan.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of French aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while it intends to respect its commitment to 'new and additional' funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider each euro borrowed to be a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often emission reduction projects based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro which is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro which is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be computed for its commitments.
But France does not find this reasoning useful: it "meets" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of grants (36.1 million euros); see the EU document for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union which uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses 46% of the funds, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, meet their commitments with 100% of the donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France is committing a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the actual financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional" as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has been handling the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The early financing chapter is a relatively short-term detail in the overall climate negotiations.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is imperative to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But France could in particular help to advance the debate on the stakes involved in longterm financing (another essential chapter under discussion at the moment): we will not get rid of the question of the 'additional character' or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
So we have the hope of the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will be arriving in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of the 'additional character' and use of the loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generaciones Futuras (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problematic treated", purchased in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the food that a child of about ten years usually consumes in four meals and a snack a day.
These model foods, which meet official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three parts of dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were tested in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants.
The balance sheet is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that are likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in virtually all cases the legal limits for each chemical are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is of concern", the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogens and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil and intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian steak, the canned tuna, and even the bread or gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
The test results showed nitrates and chloroform in the tap water.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk to the consumer from these "cocktails of pollutants" "is likely to be underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in view of the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
