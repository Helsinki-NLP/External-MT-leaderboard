The Welsh MPs are worried about looking like puppets.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should change to Member of the Parliament of Wales.
MPs were outraged by plans to rename the local assembly as the Parliament of Wales.
Members of Congress from all political parties think it's a joke.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that it was rhyming with "stupid" and "ridiculous".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "stupid".
The congresswoman said her group was completely unhappy and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a marionette.
In this context, the Welsh w is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly's committee, which is now working on a bill to amend the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Assembly deputies call will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of additional MP, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament for Wales or MPs, but the MPs variant received the most support during the public consultation.
The extra MPs are obviously proposing alternatives, but the path to consensus could be a headache for the chair, Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the assembly's work, such as rules on disqualifying additional deputies and changes to the structure of the committee system.
The additional members will hold a final vote on what they should be called when they do their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia or against it.
The national vote was organized to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, which has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would not participate in the vote.
But the referendum's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of  is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and the North Atlantic Alliance.
St. Martin's bells are ringing, and the Harlem churchmen are fighting for their lives.
"There used to be, as the old people I spoke to said, a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, we have neither.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different relationships and belongings now", he said.
Bars are no longer the cozy living rooms that people go to all the time.
As for the churches, he worries that the money from selling assets won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they'll be back where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by condominium blocks filled with people who wouldn't help the temples that stay in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the tenants who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so it will hasten the day when these churches close together, because it's unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos will actually be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by a white community before Harlem became a black neighborhood  The Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin's Church  a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that prayed nearby got ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers at Harlem's 125th Street Mall, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the faithful under the leadership of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the carillon into operation.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon the "Calls of the Poor".
An expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Experts Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the world's first carillon to feature a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who had moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Meriwether said that he had not been replaced at St. Martin's.
What happened at St. Martin's over the last few months was a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were involved by the church's rogue leaders, some by the diocese.
The congregation  the governing body of the parish, which consists of the chaplain's assistants,  wrote to the diocese in July with a warning that the diocese  would try to transfer the expenses  to the congregation, although the congregation did not participate in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while diving for lobster in California.
A 13-year-old boy was being hunted by a shark in California on the opening day of the lobster season on Saturday and was injured.
The attack occurred around 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving for half an hour with his friends on a Saturday morning when he heard a little boy screaming for help, and then he swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
At first Hamel thought it was just the excitement of catching lobsters, but then he realized something bad had happened: "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
"His whole clavicle was torn", said Hamel, adding that he had noticed it when he went up to the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, "There's a shark in the water next to you!" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Reidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said at a press briefing that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined to be a safe species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have closed the beach approaches from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that the area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty departments in department stores with trained professionals.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market with a £2.8 billion turnover that continues to grow while sales volumes of fashion clothing and home goods decline, larger beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year, demonstrating success.
The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelf space that was previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product line, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in branded departments similar to those found in stores like Boots.
Major stores are also re-launching their boutique cosmetics line, so that most products will be vegan-friendly, and this trend is becoming increasingly popular among younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance store Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily from local stores near the house is making supermarkets have to work harder to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi, Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also set up several Habitats outlets since acquiring both chains two years ago, which he says has helped boost food sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to redesign their beauty departments and pharmacies failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share the profits from the drugstore ended after a series of supermarket scandals.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyds Pharmacy for £125 million.
It was claimed that Lloyds played its part in this plan, expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said, "We've redesigned the look and feel of our beauty salons to make it better for our customers.
We've also invested in training our staff to be able to offer recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and our attractive setting and convenient location make us the best beauty house to challenge the old-fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby turned down a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby turned down an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for Truly branded home goods and accessories.
The couple's business became similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with his lucrative branded clothing business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was enraged when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth up to £1.5 million meant she would no longer have enough time to deal with Truly household goods and accessories.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and was doubled to double Willoughby's wealth to £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her vacation homes.
The source said that Truly was Holly's top priority.
This appeared to be her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left everyone in the room absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, lunch was about to start very soon.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of goods ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most iconic stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a range of products from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and possible further delays in their implementation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-year-old mother Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin were close with Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The couple vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin TV company.
Willoughby will be the spokesperson for the M&S brand and will replace Aunt McPartlin as ITV's hostess.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We will not comment on his case".
A heartfelt conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for his comments, which he considered "unpresidential" for making positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said in his parody-like dictatorial voice.
I'm not giving up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was heralded by Trump as a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have reached a dead end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Lee Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not waiting for the US to respond to North Korea's previous disarmament moves.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continued to apply sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We have very successful relations with North Korea", he said.
It could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a good relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be on the president's side, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people already there", said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds.
For example, after the Langkawi earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lamboca has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international help, so it was a bit difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palo, it's not clear if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopa, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Pulau to see if international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the constant earthquakes that Indonesia experiences, the country is still well prepared for natural disasters.
Although shelters have been built in Ochieh, there are almost none in other coastal settlements.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palo led to more deaths, even though there was a warning.
Even in the best of times, moving between Indonesia's many islands was a challenge.
And natural disasters have made logistics difficult.
A hospital ship, which was stationed on the Lombok River to treat earthquake victims, is approaching Polo, but the journey to the new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure and spent money on highways and railways.
But funding shortages plague Jock's administration as there are new elections next year.
Mr. Jokowi also faces pressure from persistent interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where Muslims are the majority and embrace a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Staridge of Liverpool pushes the ball far against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by equalising the score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Jordan Shakira as they were about 30 yards from the Chelsea goal slide, which was leading 1-0.
He made a trick of the ball to the left of himself before taking a shot at the far bar.
The attempt ended with a goal high below the top bar when the ball flew into the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kepa Arisabalagi, who jumped, straight into the net.
"He was just trying to get into this position to kick the ball, and players like Shaq were always trying to kick as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to buy us as much time as possible", Staridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Conte running, made a light pass, didn't think about it too much, and just hit the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 at the start of the second half after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues' striker in this match made a pass to Mateo Kovacic before returning to the half-defense zone and running through half the field to Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly found himself in the middle of the field.
He then made a spectacular punch, passing the ball to Azar at the goal.
Azar went around the defender and drilled into the bottom left corner of the front bar by Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videotone in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Management Agency said Sunday morning.
At a press conference, the agency's spokesman, Sutopa Purvo Nugroho, said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palo, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in rubble.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman.
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds in the Grayson Muse neighborhood on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area to contact them if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to ask anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead or seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, cameramen who may have captured some video, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
This afternoon, the woman's friends came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Museums was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be a few more hours before they are allowed to return.
The policeman explained to one man that the entire neighborhood was now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene.
She said, "This is so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced-in perimeter, and another van was outside.
Several police officers stood inside the perimeter, searching the apartment building.
Anyone with information should contact the police @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously on 0800 555 111, calling record 247 dated September 30.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell was the latest century-old blow to the "rewrite of history".
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said, "In the current debate over dismantling the statue, it was inevitable that the monument to Oliver Cromwell at the Palace of Westminster would be the object of this action.
The iconic battles of the English Civil Wars were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Ham Tornycroft's vivid portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of a man many still consider worthy of reverence.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is known since the late 19th century better than he is today as the defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of a long historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the next evolution of our nation, and Cromwell is a personally recognizable figure representing one side of that clash.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and honoured.
A killer pig maimed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China.
A man known only by his last name Yuan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a barn in the Luangshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his cousin reportedly arrived on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door to the next pigsty was open.
He said there was a big, blood-stained piggy in the barn.
According to the report, the forensic examiner confirmed that the 550-pound snake had stunned the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and injured", said a cousin named Wu (quoted by Guiyang Evening News).
CCTV footage showed that Yuan went to the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent an attack on anyone else while police collected evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pressed a Welsh farmer against his tractor and held him until his wife scared him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just funny.
They're quick-witted and very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy downpours to the southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, had a speed of 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and when Rose approaches the Southern California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, which interacts with the upcoming low pressure area, will cause heavy downpours in the southwest in the coming days.
In places, 1 to 4 inches of precipitation will cause dangerous flash floods, mudflows and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2-3 inches per hour in places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas of the northwest, especially most of Arizona, are expected to get between 2 and 4 inches of precipitation.
The tropical rainfall patterns are so dispersed that flash flooding is possible if conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be very unwelcome to walk in the desert because of the potential threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by gusty winds and dust.
The coming area of low pressure will bring heavy rain in places along part of the coast of Southern California.
The possible aggregate precipitation of more than a half-inch can lead to a slight flow of garbage and make roads slippery.
It will be the first downpour of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before raining everywhere late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, you can see extreme temperature changes in the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in the near term.
There's a good example of the dramatic temperature changes in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to strengthen and expand again.
Many states in the central and eastern United States are expected to start a warm October with temperatures of 80 degrees below zero from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearings.
More than 20 million people across six television networks watched fascinating testimony Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brett Cowan and Christina Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly dating back to the 1980s.
While the political backlash continued, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of a breaking news story on Friday: an arrangement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it was to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Cavanaugh grabbed her and tried to pull her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanagh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100% sure it wasn't.
The 20.4 million people Nielsen reported on Friday probably watched it.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that reported this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a problem with ratings of people watching TV in their offices.
For comparison, the size of the audience is like a playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News, whose analysts strongly supported Kavan's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the entire day, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million, and CNN was 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearings.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement that he would vote for Cowan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, with protesters yelling at him and as he tried to climb the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being cursed, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said the woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
"You are a woman of many kinds, " they said to him". But you are a virgin".
Flake said that his office had published the statement, and informed before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were live for several hours as the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination before a quorum of the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would review charges against the candidate next week, as the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Cowan without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview on the front page, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, spoke out against her so-called "Shakespeare" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to have a common tariff was completely ridiculous.
Wade Sims Murder: Police arrested a suspect in the death of LSU player Dayton Simpson.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the shootout.
"Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA", reports WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
The value of the mortgage is set at $350,000, reports Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Police Department released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police are asking the community for help in an investigation that could lead to an arrest.
University of Louisiana at Lafayette athletic director Joe Aliyeva thanked law enforcement for their diligence and pursuit of justice.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, coach Will Wade of the Louisiana State University basketball team said the team was devastated and shocked by Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about", Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
Ash from the eruption of the Papocatepetl volcano has reached the southern areas of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Management Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater began to show activity and 183 cases of gas and ash were reported in 24 hours.
In the center there was a loud rumbling and felt a push.
Images on social media showed that in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Sachimillo, there are thin layers of ash coating on car windshields.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police to protect public order, and thousands of others joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan independence vote.
A group of masked separatists, held back by law enforcement, threw eggs at them and sprayed them with powdered paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, fights broke out when police used their batons to hold back the protesters.
For hours, a group of independence fighters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" clashed with union activists who shouted "Long live Spain".
According to local media reports, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly favored independence, although voter turnout was low, largely due to the boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of angry protesters.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday preventing demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for the prospects of Catalan independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we're tired", he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders either in voluntary exile or in prison, awaiting trial for organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean Puch, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more intense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"My nomination as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners arrested after carjacking their home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident occurred in the Belinard Crescent area on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
Maybe at some point, a bullet was fired into the car.
The result of Mango's shot, Livingston wins over the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Mangi's first goal for Livingston secured them the win.
Livingston's success stunned Rangers, and it was enough to appoint Steven Gerrard after his few defeats in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Mangi's punch was great, as Gary Holt moved up to the same level as the Hibernians in Division Two.
Gerrard's team will lose out on the Premier League this season and next Sunday they will face the leaders, Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Prior to that, Rangers in the Europa League hosted Vienna Rapids on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended its undefeated division run to six games, and head coach Holt is still feeling defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chance because of the rude visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, but that same direction caused the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his shot, and Alan Lithgow was able to focus his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's shot.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they might disturb the guests at some point.
And that's how we accomplished the big thing.
With a penalty kick from Rangers, and Livingston's first shot, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Mengu, who made a pass and scored from the centre of the field.
By this point, the Rangers were dominating, but it turned out that the defense was useless, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely involved.
And the same thing went on in the second half, even though Alfredo Marellas did save Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was returned by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow was far behind Livingston's second set.
The balls were constantly dropped into Livingston's goal and were hit back, while the two penalty demands, after Halkett had been called to replace Glenn Middleton, and the penalty demand for the hand, were rejected.
The phenomenon of Livingston is called analytic.
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they've been great, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and lineup have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top flight, but Holt deserves credit for the way he has boosted the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was formidable, building a well-organized defense, while Mengo kept Connor Goldson and Joe Oral all over the field.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerard, they didn't meet that standard.
In their last game, they didn't have the ball, scoring just one goal, which was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the pack.
Mixed reaction to Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiles and unfounded dreams were seen as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
They fought over issues of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan is heading to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but there were many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also expressed their views, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The pro- and anti-protests reflect disagreements over a visitor who was declared a hero by some German Turks and condemned as an autocrat by others.
Motorcyclist killed in Deptford car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at approximately 10:15am British time.
The driver stopped, the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the Saturday accident.
Metropolitan police said their officers were working to identify the man and alert his next of kin.
There are road fences and bus stops nearby, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Six officers injured in riots in Long Larin Prison
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a men's prison, the prison administration said.
The riots broke out at the Long Larting prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue today.
To combat the riots, which involved eight prisoners housed in one wing, a Tornado task force was involved.
The workers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Penitentiary Service said: Specially trained prison staff were sent to deal with those who caused the riot at the Long Larin Prison.
Six employees were treated for their injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and of course, the guilty will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.
The Long Laring Royal Prison holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after an inmate attacked him.
And last October, public safety officers were called to the prison to deal with a major riot in which officers were attacked with water-polish swords.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which could be beneficial to dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week, because the traces of Hurricane Rosa in the southwest of the desert pose a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service already on Monday and Tuesday released data on flash flooding in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching with rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have caused a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with some areas reaching up to 6 inches in Magalhães County, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to see 1 to 2 inches of precipitation, with individual results reaching 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of flash flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be a long-awaited one, as their region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be useful as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a little over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme Category 2 drought, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Southern California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still a hurricane with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and so will subside.
So, in Mexico, the approach of a tropical storm is expected to cause rivers to turn upside down on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be heavy, creating a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 10 to 15 inches of precipitation is expected from Southern California to northwestern Sunnyvale, where up to 10 inches of precipitation is possible, weather.com reports.
Rose will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then continue to move through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
The main danger is expected from Rosa or its remnants, which are very heavy rains in Southern California and northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States, the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and flash floods and mudflows and landslides in the mountainous area.
Midsomer Norton attack: four attempts to arrest killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old's body was found with multiple knife wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Excelsior area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old and two others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
The police asked anyone who might have any evidence on their cell phone of what happened to go further in their search.
"Kavano is aggravated by the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party", Trump said.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the reversal of the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, East Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered from the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying accusations by Blaise Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at her arraignment.
On Saturday, the President said that today, the American people saw the brilliant, courageous character of Kavanaugh.
"A vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh", "a vote in support of one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished record in public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination, speaking of the importance of Republican turnout during the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
"I'm not just late, I'm really late", he said.
That's why I'm running for the big candidates everywhere.
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to "resist and obstruct".
"The first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday", a senior aide to the parliamentary leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rises
At least 384 people have been killed and many missing as huge waves washed up on beaches as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on a beach in the city of Palo on Friday when six-meter-high waves slammed into the shore at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake was followed by a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, and they became victims", said a spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami swept away cars, timber, houses, hitting everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before hitting the coastline.
He said that some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in the 24th arrondissement of Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges spinning and collapsing, and the mosque surrounded by water.
Further tremors continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit a district of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho called the damage extensive and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
"Casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palo, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter", said Nugroho.
The communication at Donggala was completely damaged, Nurhog said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had been dispatched to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palo, but officials say the waves came at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage posted on social media can be heard of a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting out to people on the street warning of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water fell on the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that disrupted communications around the city of Paulo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun directing cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need desperately needed food and other essentials.
The city's airport was only open for relief and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo.
The tsunami in Indonesia has caused more than 800 deaths
This is very bad.
"As World Vision staff from Dangal successfully reached the town of Palu, where workers are hiding in canvas shelters set up in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of destruction along the way", said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups began grim efforts to get disaster relief mechanisms up and running, some complained that skilled foreign workers were being prevented from coming to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start coming in if a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Aryani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open ourselves up to international help, but we don't have that status yet.
On the second night in Palo, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would miraculously be among those who would leave behind the disastrous storylines of the disaster.
On Saturday the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the body of her baby next to her.
Hendon Subandona, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has been preparing two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Montague, including the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
"As a senior paraglider, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Hendon told how within hours of news of the Roa Roa Hotel demolition spreading among the paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to Palu participants at the beach festival.
His posts, however, were marked with one gray dot instead of two blue ones.
"That means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a refill at a Newport-on-Levy ATM.
"Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was depositing cash at a cash machine in Newport, R.I"., Newport Police Department said in a press release.
"The driver of the car was robbing the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more cash", wrote the late Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran out of Brink's workplace and stole a fur coat with money that was meant for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: A rapper changes his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I am now officially known as Kenny West.
West, 41, known as Ye, used his nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for emotional reasons, said the show's creator.
Along with the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
I believe that ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it's ti", West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, all of us.
It went from the "Keny" for "One", to just "Ye" for "you", reflecting our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album  is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning toward the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, Jay-Z, also did without the link and the captions.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Abrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday, in the Plaza Tlatelolco, Lopez Abrador vowed never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot down a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly scholarships to students, opening up more free places at public universities.
"Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal groups", he said.
The United States should double funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in machine intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on machine intelligence research", says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and machine intelligence expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about AI, even though the US has no official AI strategy.
But last year, China unveiled its plan: to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the US, and we expect the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will come in the U.S"., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book Superstate Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that beat the most powerful player in the US, Atell, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China division in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next windows.
"Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants", Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away our academic leaders; it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years hired brilliant university minds to work on AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its efforts in machine intelligence (MIA).
"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to candidates for the MLA", he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council released a plan for next-generation machine intelligence.
"The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", said Li.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Machine Intelligence Center with partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Task Force on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment in AI called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature that sought to create the National Commission on Machine Intelligence Security has not monitored the process for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow for a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed NATO and EU membership.
In June, both governments struck a deal to allow for the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for a referendum.
The referendum question suggests: "Are you in favor of NATO membership and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price to pay for admission to bodies such as the European Council and NATO, Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said they will consider the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A name change would require more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The state election commission said that no reports of violations had been received by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, up from 34 percent at the last general election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters turned out.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe", said 62-year-old voter in Skopje, the capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zarica and his son Dusko vote in favor of a referendum in Macedonia dedicated to changing the country's name, paving the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Outside the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kovardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and laying out chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our heads held high, not through official doors", Kovarodarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we are proud.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can look to others like China and Russia and be part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be for", said Zaev after the vote, "because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO".
He said that the result of this would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that the referendum will be attended by 30 to 43 percent of voters, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll by a Macedonian TV channel showed 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a successful referendum, turnout needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through the Brighton defence to the goal
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling solved the defence challenge against Brighton by beating Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero did it with ease.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender and overtook several others at the edge of the Brighton field.
Then he pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker made his first touch in the penalty area and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right to bypass Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with a right-handed shot.
Aguero has some problems with his feet, Mayor Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
So here's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal in that moment.
But it was Serling who gave the Sky Blues their initial lead in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got this ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Seine made a few touches before Sterling could reach the far bar.
Sky Blues' striker hit the net before it went out of bounds.

Scherzer wants to play point guard against Rocky.
Once the Nationals were eliminated from playoff contention, there was no particular reason to force a fresh start.
But the consistently competitive Scherzer hopes to take a hit Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who remain in the lead after a one-game sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The Rockies have earned at least a tie with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to win their first division title.
Even though we're playing it cool, at least we can handle it, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, is going to be so great that the game is probably going to be the best I've ever played this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced their start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer the ball in that situation.
Scherzer, who was about to make his 34th start, on Thursday held a KPZ session and will be on Sunday on a regular break.

Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his selection of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the great, great -- I'm not late, I'm late, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back their power by any means necessary, you see,  meanness, abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cut off to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control, which we're not going to give them.
According to him, the Democrats intend to "resist and hinder".
"You see this over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats evil, vile, backward and liars.
He cited the Senate Judiciary Committee's earlier admission of Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, who received a high rating from the audience.
Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, that.
No, I don't expect it was a very bad nonverbal language the worst I've ever seen.
Work is no longer the core of the church.
It's intolerance of people who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told we're not welcome to speak up.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar response because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was censored for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, ironically, are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The announcement of the meeting held on Friday by the Nottingham East Labour Party says that we want these meetings to be meaningful and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament for the Labour Party this is exactly the kind of meeting that was on Friday
Unfortunately, the tone at most meetings today is not that, and the promise of a better, softer policy has long been forgotten, if ever there was one.
It's becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is evaluated from the point of view of whether it's acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It started soon after Jeremy took over as leader, because colleagues with whom I used to think I shared the same political views began to expect me to take a step back and take positions that I would never have agreed with on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a barrage of insults on social media calling for the election to be annulled, condemning the policies of the center, saying that I'm no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racial harassment, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of abuse rates.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a diverse organization, and with each uncertainty move or change in the selection rules, the party gets narrower.
And over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice, telling me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a high school student, provoked by Thatcher's government's neglect of my education, I have been committed to advocating for better public services for those who need them most -- whether it's a local citizen or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, not even during the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could possibly be confused about my political positions or areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those of you who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that as the country heads for Brexit, which is hurting our households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But really, the only message I have is, this is not Nottingham Momentum, this is my constituents, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of election annulment or political expediency will stop me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Air-Melrows 38-17: Invincible Air at the top
The two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but, without a doubt, Air had earned a triumph in this surprisingly exciting Premier League match for Tennant.
Now they're at the top of the table, one side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, just as their best chance, which made their masters, the coach of Peter Murch had every right to be pleased.
"We've still been testing our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I should be happy", he said.
The Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give Aire his due, he dared more than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, re-arranged by Fraser Klim, put Ira in the spotlight, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes for the Warriors game allowed Melrose to juggle the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed the missed attempt.
Klimov extended Eyre's lead with a penalty before, right in the break, he scored and then made a solo attempt, making Eyre 17-5 at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well, and a Patrick Anderson shot by Bogotá cut the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Roarid Knott, who was stretched, and after a re-start Air advanced further through a Stafford McDowell attempt implemented by Klimov.
Air, acting as Captain Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose made another man pay through Bruce Colvin's failed attempt in late February's press.
However, the hosts came back, and when Strawn Hutchinson got a yellow card for knocking out Klimov without a ball from the penalty box, McPherson landed behind Eyre.
Klimov realized his attempt, which he did again almost after the restart, after Kyle Rowe received a punch from David Armstrong in the penalty box and sent off Gregor Henry's flanker on the hosts' fifth attempt.
The Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business.
However, game star Ford Kieran is about to enter the hotel business after it turns out that he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes and stars alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the show's run, and it appears that Kernon plans to act in the sequel to Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kernon hoped to take part in the flourishing Glasgow trade.
Our Sea: Landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean again
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Civilian buildings under the blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto "The sea is ours on the right".
To recover  is our duty.
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of Chile's coastline, lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, is still alive, as is the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may have reached their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and calm, and of course it is waiting for a positive outcome", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calcadillo.
Many Bolivians will be watching the court's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will, after decades of tense negotiations, uphold Bolivia's claim that Chile is obligated to negotiate a sovereign land border with Bolivia.
Evo Morales  Bolivia's charismatic president, who faces a controversial re-election bid next year.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that will change little even if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN has no authority to decide on Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have pushed it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was monopolized by the current Bolivian administration", said Sarrat.
According to her, Morales' bellicose rhetoric has destroyed the remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that it will be very difficult to have a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veleta, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of differences for mutual benefit, he said.
Calcadilla also denied that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  used the maritime issue as a political prop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"Resolution" is an opportunity to see that we need to move beyond the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming deadlocked nuclear diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it's a pipe dream that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are demanding a second summit.
But there's a lot of skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up its weapons, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show we saw the newest line in massive headgear on the way to the stores in your cities
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely cover the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of unusual headwear for their SS19 collection, which has exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was buzzing with unrealistic hats, with designers sending their creations to the podium.
Valentino's trademark was a luxurious beige hat, adorned with wide, feather-like bands that filled the models' heads.
Other unusually large accessories included jewel-encrusted macaws, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but they weren't meant to keep your head warm.
Tim Brown also showed us a collection of his fancy masks just before Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks had sewn lipsticks and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of them resembled a submarine rig with a tube and protective goggles, and the other  resembled a molten cone of ice cream.
And if you're holding on tight to the great attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that giant hats will make their way into our everyday lives.
The oversized hats go on heels to La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat that you can see on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rataykowski.
A cult label for a very uncomfortable hat that went viral on social media led to another great creation on the podium -- a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model with this bag in her swimsuit.
A dark orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia facade and covered with a white leather handle, became a prominent piece in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see great hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has had such an impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
JE: Language is a necessary skill for every citizen in the world.
Independent schools in Scotland continue to excel academically, and this has continued since 2018 with another outstanding test result, supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing the best possible performance for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are committed to preparing their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it stays in their head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
And from the last exams this year, we see that language is at the top of the league tables for the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages got the highest grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS-participating schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved A or higher in Chinese, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of French, and 63 percent of Spanish also achieved A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a vital skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the years ahead.
Languages are now being chosen as a subject in the same way that STEM is in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the reasons employers cited for difficulties filling vacancies, 17 percent were related to poor language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly a necessity to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more promising jobs that require language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you choose, learning a second language will be a real advantage in the future, if you have these lifelong skills.
The ability to connect directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the top spot.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for kids today.
Being multilingual, especially in developing countries, will give kids a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the language of instruction.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK to look to in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a language school with a faculty who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
Now, there's no denying that in the global business environment, languages are still vital to the future of a country, and this needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and benefit to young people in Scotland.
This must be done
John Edward  Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron makes his debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is still to be determined.
"It's going to be greater than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James is likely to play in limited minutes.
As was the practice this week, James was asked about his plans for the six preseason games.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to prepare", he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a major campaign.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump speeches next week, including stops at friendly locations in Tennessee and Mississippi.
In confirming his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is seeking to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is cast in November.
When does Trump's speech start tonight in West Virginia and how can you watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider a hearing this week on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who is struggling with sexual harassment allegations with a Senate vote expected to be confirmed within a week as the FBI investigation continues.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to help Republicans who are facing the November election.
So President Trump's campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at activating volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, reports Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's event could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of Pittsburgh media, reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is leading in the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try to give him a push in the polls", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA moves to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Thursday's four-way game was probably just what you needed for that Ryder Cup.
The swinging pulse oscillator is a completely made-up concept in sports that the players sincerely believe in, and it's nothing more than a similar competition.
So where would they say the pulse now?
'They had a six-point lead, and now  four, so I think we're passing it with a little impulse,' said Jordan Sleepy, walking through the day.
Europe, of course, is four points ahead, and there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans, says Spith, feel a little bit out of the way, and they have a lot of hope, not least because of the form Spite and Justin Thomas have had all day, and they each have three points out of four.
Spite was lethal from T-shirts to green and is a prime example.
These throaty cries of celebration grew louder as his round lasted, and he sank a decisive blow to play the match on four fields when he and Thomas lost two to two.
His shot that gave them the win on the 15th was met with a kind of scream, kind of like telling you that he thinks the U.S. team is still out.
"You just have to go in there and worry about your own match", Spitty said.
Already every one of those players is gone.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players to score more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Malinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champions.
Weird but enchanting couples in Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
The only couple that didn't make the gods on Saturday afternoon was the Mallywoods, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and Friday afternoon.
It happens, and how their energy seems to flow to and from this stormy crowd, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a potential win in Europe when the sun sets at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or the Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different orifices.
It's too early to talk about European fame.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning show, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The Boggs and the two doubles on the front nine dug out the Spanish and the Swedish hole, from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your pit.
Four-ball and four-quarter games are so exciting to watch because of the interaction between the pairs they make, the tips they give, the tips they don't follow, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has been the better team so far and has taken a significant role in the final day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the U.S. team is looking forward to a fight that some have questioned, especially in the United States.
Europe goes to the Ryder Cup final with a 10-6 record.
Europe will have a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-quarter games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari duo led the fight with two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, seeking to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American agency dissatisfaction this morning, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a four-ball match, winning two games, but they couldn't do much more.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and the Molliwoods, who were renamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four shots, they were spectacularly consolidated to beat the downed Woods and American rookie Bryson DeComb by 5 and 4.
Woods, who retired after two games on Saturday, showed an occasional burst of brilliance, but now he's lost 19 of 29 games in four-goal and four-goal and seven-goal games.
Justin Rose, resting on x four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a four-ball match to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepcke  both ranked second in the world.
Europe had no way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the checkpoint for the Americans by two points.
They earned a 2-1 victory over John Rham and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and came back later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the four-ball, losing by two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit going it alone, even though the Furry owners only need to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of best of the best, Sunday's counterattack looks like they'll pull it off.
North Korea says that they will not disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations was extending sanctions that strengthen mistrust of the United States, and that the country could not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
Ri Yun Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty in our national security, and in that situation, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves in the first place.
While Ri re-published the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement proved significant in that he did not deny the unilateral declaration of denuclearization that Pyongyang had made in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to provide security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is officially trying to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on denuclearization and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive way, and even opposes declaring the end of the war", says Ri.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only increases our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, and added, "If South Korea, not the United States, were involved in this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be such a dead end".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, where he claimed that North Korea's missile attack on the US mainland was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a rocket-propeller.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are fighting at the UN, and the Security Council has said that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must be proactive and continuous until we are sure of complete, definitive and genuine denuclearization".
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the Security Council halls, and the General Assembly later announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea in hours of talks ended in a statement that he was making "gangster-like" demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle its missile and nuclear facilities if the United States responded.
Trump said that according to Kim, the appropriate measures he expects are a guarantee of security and a drive to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students take a course on proper rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is to teach students to sleep more, and to fight the culture of studying late at night with coffee in hand.
He concluded that students at one of the world's top universities often have a poor understanding of how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a senior fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired by a talk he had given about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, so he started a class.
And at the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, "Why didn't you tell me that until I was a senior?"
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep", he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course taught to students explains how good sleep habits promote academic and athletic achievement and improve overall mood.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were often sleep deprived for weeks at a time.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
One section has a picture of a dorm room where students are clicking on coffee mugs and curtains and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime habits.
In the final stage, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive images, challenged participants to think about their daily lives.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we feel they should know as much as anyone about the health effects of smoking", added Professor Chesler.
He said the culture of late-night parties still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students is leading to sleep deprivation, which is proving to be a growing problem.
"Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be the secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, "even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain hungry all the time".
Raymond Seo, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop the course.
He said the course was eye-opening and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes the next step will be to require all undergraduates to complete a similar program before entering university.
Professor Chesler recommended that students set a watch to know when to go to bed and when to wake up, recognizing the harmful effects of blue light emitted from monitor screens and LED lights that can alter the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Mengo scores a goal for Gerrard.
Rangers suffered another defeat when a goal by Dolly Mangi assured that Stephen Gerrard would not lose 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox are keen to record their first win on their way to a 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holtons side are already bearing Gerrard's second defeat as manager from 18 games to leave on their side eight points behind Premier League leaders Ladbrokes Hearts.
Mengo scored with seven minutes to go, and the Rangers, inspired by the goal, didn't look like they were going to lose.
While the Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, with the Hibernians behind them with a difference in goals.
Additional problems for the Rangers may come after forward Colum Spence has to undergo treatment for a head injury after being hit by an object thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight substitutions, which caused Ira to miss the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi's under number 11, which had allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they at every turn outperformed their rivals.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Livingston made more attempts to score.
They were supposed to score two minutes later when Mengi first sent the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took the chance.
A successful penalty by Jacobs Cagan caught Craig Halkett's surprise, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed to deliver a powerful punch from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, they were more hopeful of scoring than they were of playing well.
Alfredo Marellas certainly should have been fined with a quarter of an hour left when he and Stephen Lawless clashed on the field, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not take Columbia's appeal.
The Rangers managed to hit the goal only in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly almost gave the goal to Lassanne Kulibari and an effective Ovi Echearia attack.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute, Levy may have been against continuing the game, but there's no denying that they have to show the fans a good game.
Once again, the Rangers failed to break through Jacobs' goal.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for a goal.
Gerard replaced Cueballis for Ryan Kent at halftime, and it had a big impact as the forward made his way to Marelos, but Kelly's impressive run blocked the shot.
But Livingston continued to entertain the visitors by playing the game they loved, while Lithgow and Halkett continued to share the ball after a long struggle.
Holt's side was able to take the lead only in the last few minutes, but McGregor was playing well enough to oppose Jacobs before Lithgow went to the bench.
Rangers' replacement by Glenn Middleton happened once again after a penalty shoot-out when he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson managed to evade.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter.
A page from our almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and ANNONCE... the day of the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the invention of the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter became part of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film called Coronado, starring the seemingly little-known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What is it on Earth?
RW: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on headphones, you can actually hear the sounds of atoms emitting radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "Say, is it really cracking now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system identify cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system recognize bad cells and kill them.
The vaccine is sort of training the immune system to recognize the bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
This is a technique that involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a lab.
The cells can then identify the protein that is present in many cancer cells and then re-introduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine has shown success in patients with many different types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that helps her immune system recognize cancer cells saw ovarian cancer disappear in 18 months.
It involves taking immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the lab so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancer cells, and then re-injecting them.
"Our results suggest that there is a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer cells that fight breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, says Professor Berezovsky.
This approach to targeting immune cells in patients and re-training them to reach cancer cells has worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West entered the debate in support of Trump, wearing the title of MMA, after his appearance on SNL.
Which didn't turn out well.
In the studio on Saturday night, Kanye West was humiliated after a speech in which he praised the United States, and President Donald Trump announced that he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", in the evening, wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat, he took a stand against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
How many times have I talked to white people and they said, "How can you support Trump when he's a racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon in the title role, where the Hollywood star teased Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the sexual assault trial of Christina Blasey Ford.
Although the performance was not broadcast, West's words were captured and uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to pick on West.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They were teasing me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat.
They were teasing me.
"And then they say I'm in a dying spot", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see the dead spot?" "By saying he's going to wear my Superman hat, which means he can't tell me what to do.
Try to love.
His statements led to at least two recording sessions, and the SNS was confused by the news from Verity.
West was hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It, dressed in a Perrier water bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the Conservative Tory Party, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits, thank you for your support".
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote that West is just who he is, and that's always great.
But I've decided not to reward anyone by buying their music or their clothes or by supporting their art, which I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
"Just like we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that his name was now officially Kenny West.
He wasn't the first artist to change his name to follow in the footsteps of Diddie, also known as Puff Diddie.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was attacked at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhacomore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the State Attorney's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington was obsessed with idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is best known for his sword swing and his role as John Snow in the HBO medieval action series Game of Thrones
But the 31-year-old actor has developed a stereotype of a macho hero, which means that young boys often feel more ruthless about respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture section, Keith said he thought something had happened and asked how to address the idealized brutality of the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" neighbor Rose Leslie, also 31, said he felt empowered to tackle this problem.
"I feel like a strong guy personally - when we've been wrong about courage?" he said.
Why are we going to educate men when they grow up in terms of the attitudes we see today?
Whale believes that television should be responsible for the appearance of brutality because of the very masculine characters.
He went on, "What's at the beginning, and why do we teach it?"
Why is it that we teach on TV and on the streets, making young boys feel that they have to be so confident to be human?
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time -- how do we change this?
Because obviously something is wrong with young people.
He also admitted in an interview that the series would end next summer, and he would retire from the series' battlefield and not do any docu-series or sequels to Game of Thrones.
Starting in November, Whale will begin re-creating the True West of Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, a bandit.
Recently, the actor said that he considered meeting his wife Rose the best way to end Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family and my life here", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character played by Whale's love interest John Snow in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's mansion in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been transmitted in some parts of China through blood transfusions.
"However, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has fallen to almost zero", Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
Because of conservative values in this country, about 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread by poor awareness and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the spill of data, the danger and conspiracy theory by her staff in the parliament
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dropped charges that her employee posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that they had a claim against far-right members and their websites.
"A lie, a lie, and a lot of nasty lies", Waters tweeted.
The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers in the U.S.S.S. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Committee hearing on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh went online Thursday.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address of the source was linked to Waters' office and distributed information from a member of Waters' team,  reports Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
A member of my team whose data, privacy, and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This is a baseless claim that is completely false and completely misleading.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is infuriating", wrote Fleischer.
It shows that she lacks the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They shouldn't behave outrageously.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They should be calm and temperate.
Flescher compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being too spoiled during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican Party candidate running in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
"It resonates when it's true", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are found", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to anyone in my team".
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again hits a blow at the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
It's now a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new British-themed film, and that bias seems to be in the Johnny English comedy and action franchise that started back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued into 2011 called The Johnny English Revival.
Can a satire really say how obviously ridiculous we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time it went to print, the incompetent Johnny English got a chance to laugh at things  his name was louder than any comic creation he had made for a non-English audience in the movies.
We know he's a secret agent who, despite his fanciful claims to glamour, turned out to be a bit like Clouseau with Mr. Bean features and a bit like the guy who played the single note in the Fire Choir at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally, his character was based on the traveller and international mystery Atkinson, who once played a forgotten Barclays card, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are some good moments that we didn't have before.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blades banging a little on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is clearly demonstrated, but the humor is felt weakly, and so surprisingly especially when serious films like Agent 007: Miss Impossible offer comedy as a major part.
The humor feels as if it's not just for adults, but for kids, and even Johnny English's silly accidents aren't as inventive as Atkinson's silent movies of Bean.
A long-term prerequisite is the UK's serious problems.
A hacker infiltrated the top-secret British spy community in the UK, revealing the names of all the British agents on the ground, much to the chagrin of the agent on duty -- unfortunately, a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a proud, confused man who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Theresa May, but there's nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every real spy will be exposed, she will have to hire someone who is already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself, it's a little bit more complicated, because he's now a sixth-grade teacher at a couple of fancy institutions and he's teaching classes on how to be a naked cameraman, which are some good examples here, because English also offers spy lessons at the Academy of Music.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and was reunited with his old friend Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
Right now, Bo's marriage is tied to a submarine commander, a role Vicky Pepperdine has played rather unsuccessfully.
So Batman and Robin get things horribly wrong at the Queen's Secret Agency, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Olga Kurylenka.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous assignment from a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's hacking problem: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Beau start their action with immediate things: disguising themselves as a waiter, setting fire to a French restaurant; setting up a pogrom, fighting smugglers aboard the luxury yacht Volta; English commits sheer anarchy as he tries to use a VR set to explore the interior of the Volta house.
All the moments are stretched out for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy as the ones that have quite a lot of childishness on TV.
It's pretty good stuff.
And as with all the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think, why not give the British film industry a role that really shows off Rowan Atkinson's talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay the British for a four-day workweek with pay as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan to make the British work only four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on to workers the work done by the AI revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It was obvious that the employees would enjoy three days off, but they would still get the same pay.
The source notes that the idea fits the economic program of the party and plans to direct the country to support workers.
The trade union congress approved the shift to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The planned review will be announced before the end of the year".
It's not going to happen now, but a four-day workweek is an idea that fits with the party's vision and overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy in the workers' favor.
The Labour Party is not the first to embrace the idea, and the Green Party has promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations as a whole are not being supported.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day workweek is not the goal of party policy, and it is not the party's policy".
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the ruthless directors and managers to the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also include that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire stake, as the Labour government may make a deduction based on alleged violations.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create joint-stock funds to transfer 10 percent of the private company's own funds to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy told 60 Minutes that an FBI investigator working with Kavanaugh might have to change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been postponed until the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the Republican Senate Bureau's findings will be supported.
In an interview on Sunday's 60 Minutes, Scott Pelly asked Republicans John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about "Meaning: Can the FBI reveal anything that can lead to change?"
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said, on my way to the court hearing, "I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and asked him about the accusation, saying, "You did this?"
He was decisive and unambiguous.
Graham's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Brett Kavanaugh decided that this would be a scandalous indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett is in complete denial", Graham said, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
But none of those who heard her say this could believe it.
She's only 36.
I don't see anything new.
What is the International Citizens' Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City hosts the International Music Festival: an annual music event with a very impressive lineup of performers and artists and a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for the seventh year, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on the Great Meadow of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy a concert by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, and learn about the true purpose of the event: to end poverty and nakedness by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project Against Poverty, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks, either "eligible to participate", volunteer, email a country's leader, call any other activist, and raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civic Festival over the past 12 years, and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free gigs a genuine way to convince people that they need to take action, or is this just another case of so-called "calling" -- people feeling like they're doing a good thing by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the festival's organizers say they have recorded more than 19 million shares from their fans, who are striving to achieve various goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage powerful leaders to fulfill commitments worth more than $37 billion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has provided 390 comments on commitments and statements worth at least $10 billion that have already been allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include providing food, partnering with UK-based investors and performers, helping children develop to their full potential, pledging $35 million to help Rwanda avoid malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens around the world, we can end the social injustice of malnutrition in history", said Ambassador Tracy Ullman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 campaigns to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the "Help Nutrition" project, which reaches 5 million women and children with malnutrition problems.
To answer one of the most frequently asked questions on the site, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Festival said: It's going to be a long and hard road, and sometimes we're going to fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the many people who will be speaking at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US Navy could use a blockade to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
Washington may use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from entering the EU and Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zink said, reports Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are grounds for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just like they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability to use the Navy to ensure the opening of sea lanes and, if necessary, blockade them to ensure their energy doesn't reach the market", he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia more or less balances and replaces fuel", he said, calling Russia a one-sided country with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements come at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase its LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to abandon the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being built to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project originates in the economy and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have a common view that energy cannot be a leverage tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans were dealt a blow by Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The main German organization representing the industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to seriously discuss her involvement in the 2020 presidential election, says a senator from Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a speech at the Halifax, Massachusetts, town hall, Warren confirmed that she was considering her involvement.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and clean up our ineffective government, and I'm talking about women in the highest office", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
During her speech at the mayor's office, Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, polls released Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents did not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names among Democrats who have been discussed in connection with a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision officially by January.
At the Donald Trump rally, Sarah Palin mentioned her PTSD.
26-year-old Trek Paulin spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son is going through now that he's back home, I can compare to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the injuries that our soldiers are returning with on other families", she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the arrest a "painful question" and said that her son, along with other war veterans, turned a little different, hardened, returning with the question of whether there was the respect that soldiers, pilots, other military personnel fought for by giving themselves to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of a domestic violence report, and carrying a drunk gun, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang oppression or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a briefing on Friday in Washington to support a challenge to the asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against Federal Policy, was not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner, Wu, and his gang members had raped her, but the U.S. authorities refused to grant her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which received the highest number of asylum requests in the United States, as countries with serious problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy ignores decades of legislative experience from states, the country and the world.
"Federal law requires that asylum applications be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates that principle", the memo reads.
The lawyers also said in the memo that policies that deny immigrants do more harm to the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and create the jobs they need.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer give refuge to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion", Sessions said on June 11 announcing the policy.
Refuge has never meant the solution to the problems, even the very serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, where the number of deaths has doubled in search of survivors.
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
"It's very tense", says the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish young son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palo.
Every minute, a fast car brings bodies in.
Clean water is very little.
The tenants started returning to their ruined houses, picking up wet things, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwyane Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the Army's Paul Hospital, where patients are being treated on the street for repeated violent blows.
Tears came to his eyes as he recalled the feeling of the powerful underground shocks in his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to flee.
I was trapped under the ruins of the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of "threats" using "propaganda"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily, touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned the paid supplement China Daily in the Des Moines Register  Iowa's best-selling newspaper  after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional election on November 6th, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US election marked what US officials called a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While placing ads by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war that has resulted in mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
The repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts say, were imposed to hurt exporters like businesses in Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstaed wrote in a column for the Des Moines Register Sunday, is now redoubling its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's good traditions of free speech and free press by printing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstad.
"And if you look at the newsstands in Beijing, you will find not many votes against and not a real reflection of the other opinions that Chinese people may have about the dangerous trajectory of the economy given the fact that the press is under the iron fist of the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most influential newspapers had declined an offer to print his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans push back women voters ahead of midterm election with Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
While many prominent Republicans are defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that they will get a blowback, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion around this was very strong, and most Republicans have already shown that they are ready to vote.
"These things are irreversible", Grant Richar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Richard said he wasn't sure that Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona's statements about the FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They are not going to forget it tomorrow and in November", said Corinne Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate chamber when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite a statement by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be tremendous", said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
People say they're already tall, and they're right.
But they can be even higher, especially among suburban women voters and young voters between 18 and 29 who don't like the president but often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she detailed her accusations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if the Republicans insisted on confirmations, there could be a strong blowback.
"For the Republican Party, it's become a mixed bag", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's about how the Republicans handled it and how they responded", Guy Cecil, news director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news outlet.
However, it seems that Americans are divided over whether Ford or Kavanaugh is right, with the latter being slightly more favorable.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents either trusted or were not very sure of Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they either trusted or were not very sure of Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is investigating allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, when drunk, had solicited her when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that's built on an open source platform called Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that when he created Inrupt, he had the idea of dominating the world.
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online repository, or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a fanatic and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all coming together in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal data store online is that only the user can determine who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment with data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to give the company an opportunity to bring together the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that was bought by IBM, a few contracted developers working on the project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenner-Lee said that he and his team have not talked to Facebook and Google about whether or not to implement a complete change if all their business models are overhauled instantly.
We don't ask them for their permission.
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial power and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very vocal advocate of net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: a tribute to a priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel the Reverend Bernard Van was decorated on 29 September 1918 for his part in the attack on Bellinglyz and Leacourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper's bullet and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military decoration.
In Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday, his two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded it.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de San Quentin - through thick fog and under heavy enemy rifle and machine gun fire.
Then he ran into the line of fire and with great courage led the soldiers forward, seizing the gun and knocking out three divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, and a little over a month later the war was over.
Michael Van, 72, said that what his grandfather did was something that I could never do, and something that was also respectable.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid down the crown after a parade led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Wang said it was a great honor to be part of the parade, and added that "the courage of a true hero was demonstrated by the support that many people gave".
MMA fans waited all night to see the Bellator 206, they instead got the pig peppa
Just imagine, you've been up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206 broadcast, and then you're denied the main event.
The San Jose show had 13 fights, including six on the main card, and they were live-streamed all night on Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, as Gerard Moussaoui and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, the British audience was stunned when the show changed to Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night specifically waiting for this fight.
One Twitter fan called the switch to children's cartoons "someone's stupid joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications said, "By government order at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to a children's program".
Yes, "Pep the Pig".
Bellator president Scott Coker said that in the future they would work on a show to take into account British viewers.
"I think we'll discuss the possibility of repeating, I think we can solve this issue", said Cocker.
But it's now six o'clock on a Sunday morning, and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday, our time, which is Monday, their time.
But we're doing the best we can.
And believe me, when the schedule changed, we got a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem by thinking it was a technical glitch.
But it turned out to be the government's decision.
I promise, this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of hits from six to five, like we always do, but this time we wanted to please the fans, but we went too far.
This is a very unpleasant situation.
Tom Daley felt "unimportant" because of his sexuality.
Olympic water-jumping champion Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality -- but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
He was a 24-year-old athlete, and he said he didn't realize that everyone was like him until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Disney Desert Island" show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that when he had a child, he started to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional host of this rather old show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
As the man who ended up on a desert island on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as a child, he felt "less than everyone else", because society didn't accept those who liked both boys and girls.
He said, "I still believe that feeling that you're different and insignificant was what gave me strength and inspiration to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was somebody, he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone who found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a major activist in the LGBT movement and at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, he called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he spoke up because he was fortunate enough to live in the open, not being persecuted, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the man -- the American screenwriter, director and producer Dustin Lance Black -- whom he met in 2013, it was a surprise.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he said the age difference didn't matter.
"When you go through something like this at such a young age". He went to his first Olympics at 14, and three years later his father died of cancer. He said it was hard to find a peer of his age who had gone through those ups and downs.
They became parents last June, their son's name is Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daily said his "prospects" had changed completely.
"If you asked me last year, I would have told you that I needed to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things in this world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robby  this is my Olympic gold medal.
His son, named after his father, Robert, died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said his father couldn't accept the fact that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was, did they buy tickets to the 2012 London Olympics -- he wanted to sit in the front row.
'I couldn't tell him 'you're not gonna sit in the front row, Dad,' he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized that he wasn't immortal", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew this is what I've wanted all my life -- to jump in the water in front of my fans at the Olympics, it's the best feeling", he said.
It also influenced the choice of the song  Proud by Heather Small  which found a buzz in him in the build-up to the Olympics and from which ants still run.

Mickelson, who is out of form, remains on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record Sunday with his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to get back in shape before it becomes a bad event.
Mickelson, who will play in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's foreball.
Instead of being in the spotlight, which he was often for the U.S. National Team, the five-time World Cup winner divided his days between cheerleading and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now, at 48, he's not the ideal choice for the tough Le Golf National course, where inaccurate shots are severely punished.
And if the field isn't grim enough, Mickelson will face British Open defending champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in their first 12 singles, start out strong, Mickelson's match could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this player, but could say nothing more.
"He understood his role for today, he patted me on the back, he hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's very confident.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot to the team last and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two matches.
I planned more, but it worked out just the way we thought it would play.
He wants to be on the field just like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Fold's record for most Ryder Cup games played on a Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that was never as good as the one-man show.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence had benefited the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with a sense of humor, likes to make fun of people, and he's just a really nice guy, and it's nice to have him on the team", he explained.
I believe that the younger players have enjoyed parrying his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team much more than just a game.
The captain of the European team Thomas Byrne knows that the great divide can be closed soon
Thomas Byrne, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before the individual games of the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in a 1997 match at the Waldorf, where the European team under Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimal lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Waldheim we had a big lead and we won, but with difficulty, we had a big lead in Brooklyn where we lost", Byrne said after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
"History shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you have to play at all hundred.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Until the points are on the table, nothing is done.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, that's what we're going to focus on.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we know very well that on the other side, we have the best players in the world.
Pleased with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Björn added: "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow is a completely different game.
Tomorrow we have a one-on-one game, and this is a whole different game.
It's great to be on the field with a partner and it's going great, but when you're playing alone, that's where your true talents as a golfer come into play.
This is what we need to tell the players, that they have to be their best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, we have to go to the pit and also show our best as an individual player.
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furyk relies on his athletes to play better individually than they did in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these final day games, playing for a winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every word of that", he said, when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was upsetting his players on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you always want to have a quick start like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the speed increases, the greatest pressure is on the players in the middle of the game.
We've got the schedule and we've got the players in the way we want them, and we're going to try to get some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with starting and will face Rory McIlroy in the main event, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Romm, Tommy Fleetwood and John Poulter will play against top golfers.
"I put my players in this order because I think that's how I'm going to close it", Björn said of his selection for individual matches.
The launch of a new German warship is postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace older Cold War-era warships, but it will not arrive until next year due to faulty systems and ever-rising costs, according to local media reports.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014, but problems that arose after construction have hampered this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships ordered in 2007 are to replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics  longer maintenance intervals  more new frigates may not enter their docks for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships  that could allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country  will be obsolete by the time they finally enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially declined to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reason for the return, but German media reported numerous "defects in software and equipment" that made the ship unsuitable for combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships had only 120 sailors  half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship had a very large weight, which reduced its performance and limited the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, twice the weight of similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project  including the training of the crew  also becomes a problem.
The price has reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars)  from an initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are building up with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defense committee in the German parliament, said the Navy had fewer and fewer ships capable of carrying out military missions.
He said that the problem is getting worse as the ships age and are being scrapped, and there are no ships to replace.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were capable of joining the Navy.
The National Trust has been listening in on the secret lives of bats.
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to explore how the spotted hyena use the landscape to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to discover something new about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future efforts to conserve these animals.
A study by the National Trust for Scotland's scientists is looking at small butterflies and also the brown long-eared Dabanton butterflies in the Inverurie Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations throughout the area to monitor the activity of the bats during the season.
Our community staff and volunteers will conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of all the recordings to determine the frequency of the calls of the bats, as well as what they said and did.
The habitat map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, a counselor at the National Conservation Society, hopes the results will reveal which areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of creating habitats like meadows and how to maintain forests for the butterflies and other related animals.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect and destroy their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as can adhesive tape for flies and some chemicals in building materials, and they can also be a risk for domestic cats.
The monkeys are not blind at all.
However, because of their nocturnal nature, bats' ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Society, which oversees more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It is staffed by 10 trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, habitat checks, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary at the Tribe Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it's a perfect area for bats.
"Here in Tribe, we have a great place for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we still don't know much about bats, so our work here and at other sites will help us better understand what they need for a better life. 
He stresses the importance of bat checks before any renovation is made, as one saddle can be inadvertently destroyed, killing up to 400 females and young bats, leading to the complete extinction of the local population.
The prisoners are under guard and are not allowed to kill, intimidate, disturb or destroy their saddles.
Elizabeth Farrell, of the Bat Conservation Foundation in Scotland, urges the public to help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many of the species live in their populations".
Ronald denies rape charges and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape accusations against him "fake news", saying people wanted to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
The forward for the Portugal and Juventus national teams was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars to keep quiet, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, the 33-year-old Ronaldo addressed his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were published, calling the post "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a game.
Today's news is "fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to do a commercial on my name.
It's all right.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm a happy and good man", he added with a smile.
Ronaldinho's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations that it "reported suspiciously in a private matter", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for moral damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is perhaps the most serious personal rights violation in years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a luxury room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronald and Majorgo seem to have returned to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to court documents from Clark County, Nevada.
The Major claims that after that, Ronaldo got down on his knees and said that at 99 percent he was a good guy who was suffering from the one percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted to having sex with them, but with mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was very afraid of revenge and was worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reinstate the charge because she feels emotionally traumatized by the case.
At the time of the alleged incident, Ronaldo was planning to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Juventus in Italy, signing a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the loss of its carmakers
Britain will always regret losing its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said UK Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was "worried" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily cut production at its Barnaston plant, near Derby, in half.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays from a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Barnaston plant, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's head of business in Barnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be conducted if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, announces that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that carmakers are talking about the risk to supply chains from a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29th without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border that lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota will be unable to keep more than a day's supply of parts at its Derby plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checker Plan for the future relationship with the EU was designed precisely to avoid these border checks.
"We need a deal. We want to get the best deal that will not only make today a success, but also allow us to seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The information we get not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to keep our supply chains running.
Toyota could not say how long the shutdown would last, but in the future, it warned that the added cost would reduce the factory's competitiveness and lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsvalaris, who has been at Barnaston for 24 years and is a union coordinator, said that union members are very concerned: "In my experience, if jobs are cut, they will not recover.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a clear plan for our future relationship with the EU, which is trustworthy".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed another week as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh rages, a White House spokesman said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference, Trump aides' ties to Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump fires the assistant attorney general or not, and thus jeopardizes Mueller's independence, has been adding fuel to the fires of Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refuted this.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump on Thursday, who was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash at a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blasey Ford, were speaking.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further slowing the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "No date yet, maybe this week, maybe next week, I think a week later, given all the other things going on in the Supreme Court case.
But it's going to happen, and I always keep the press updated.
Some journalists are willing to dispute her claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
And the host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings was not because of her contempt for TV reporters who "work for the public", though she added, "I agree with the fact that they work for the public".
Then she said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
"The president has more press briefings than any president before him", she said, adding without elaborating, "We've looked at those numbers".
Briefings are happening, Sanders reported, but when the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do this the last few weeks, and these meetings where you can ask the president a question directly, they're going to replace briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in street meetings or press conferences with high-ranking foreign guests.
Press conferences by the president are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when he freely and sometimes extravagantly appeared before reporters.
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to EU workers in Scotland's health system before Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland's healthcare system to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government is already willing to cover the cost of residence applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The UK and the EU have been in talks for the summer about our country's exit, leading to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government was also rushing to prepare for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubled time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU and beyond, are providing valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of our healthcare system, also benefiting patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Sunday's game that his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player's injury came just before the break.
"He went over the sideline and fell", said Reed.
The coaches and medics gave Abercombe oxygen still on the field before putting him on a stretcher and carrying him for diagnosis.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no "details about what kind of injury it was", and Tennessee State was trying to determine when the player got injured.
Abercombe, a sophomore athlete, is in his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five complete interceptions, bringing his total to 18 interceptions for the season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay higher duties
Under the new Conservative plan, foreign buyers of British property will pay higher taxes and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the success of the Corbyn initiative in attracting young voters
Raising government duties will hit taxpayers in the UK
Treasury plans to receive up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British property will pay higher government taxes, and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters and provide affordable housing, which is targeted at high-income people.
The increase in the tax is aimed at individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the proceeds will go to a government program to provide housing for the homeless.
The increase in the current state levy, including the higher rates passed two years ago on second homes and rental housing, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new homes in London are bought by non-UK residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to buy their first home.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially the capital - have become ghost towns, with large numbers of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the UK.
The new policy comes literally weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state tax on young home buyers to make it easier to buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing and underutilizing land, and urged Mrs. May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's disgraceful housing situation.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of vocal housing reforms, including controlling rent and ending "unjustified" evictions.
He also wants to give local councils more power over housing construction.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I said I would devote my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British Dream, to making life better for each new generation.
It means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it's unfair that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy property as easily as working UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to manage the Scottish national team.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his biggest ambition is to one day coach the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is on a mission to rebuild the north-east club, now in third place in the Premier League, three points clear of first.
He took up the job last summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But it didn't work", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
I grew up playing for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my dad, and something always made me want to come back.
But that opportunity will come if I am a successful club coach.
Ross' previous coaching positions at Sunderland included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poye and Paul Di'Cogna.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid of such big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now success for me will be the answer to the question, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
"The structure and the material base of the club, his place is definitely in the Premier League", he said.
"Not only to bring it back, but I will consider my work successful only if I can bring the club back".
Ross has only been a coach for three years, having previously been an assistant coach at Dumbarton and spent 15 months at the Hartford Athletic Club.
Then he helped Aloha back from the third tier and turned Saint-Mirin from a loser who almost made it to the Championship into the winner the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
And when he looked back at his work at Aloha, he said, "It was a really important decision".
I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than playing football.
It sounds amazing, because I was doing a good job, I was getting paid well, I was reaching some heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I still go through that when I talk about stress and pressure, but coaching is what you need.
I always wanted to train, and I'm doing it now, and for me, this is the best time of my adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Saturday, September 30th on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 UTC
According to a study the perfect time to have a pint of beer is 5:30 on a Saturday
The hot summer has boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but has put pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the Pubs and Bars Group, sales increased 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant sales fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy group that compiled the statistics said, "The continued sunny weather and longer than expected England's run to the World Cup final means that July is going to be like June, when pubs saw sales increase by 2.8 percent, and restaurants suffered even more.
Restaurant sales fell 1.8 percent in June, only getting worse in July.
Pubs and bars, which mostly sell drinks, have so far shown the best results unlike restaurants.
The pubs with the most food also suffered from sunburn, although not as badly as the restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks rose 6.6 percent, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and accommodation analyst, said: "These results are becoming a trend that we've seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes at the food market.
No wonder restaurants keep struggling, because sales are down 4.8 percent a year, which is very uncomfortable when prices keep rising.
The long, hot summer has come at a bad time for operators who are focused on food, and time will tell if the cooler temperatures in August will bring the much-awaited relief.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is an important industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents.
Research shows that one in five children -- some as young as 11 -- have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages.
This news has fueled fears that there are pornographic content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account that they showed their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- create social media accounts that they keep secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts that supposedly lead to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This news fueled fears that they were posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept "clean" basic accounts to show their parents, and they also kept private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found out that she had been encouraging others to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of teenagers aged 11 to 18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Chief Executive Mike Buchanan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places online where neither parents nor teachers can find them".
Eileen Doyle will be the athlete's voice at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer board member at the annual general meeting of that body.
Doyle, Scotland's most decorated athlete and chairman, Ian Beatty, described the event as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her experience at a variety of levels, including international over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the global sporting community, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her work with the council", said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I want to act as the voice of athletes and hopefully help govern sport in Scotland".
An American who won gold in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals at other Olympics, and who now works as a BBC pundit, can't walk after suffering a micro-stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would improve.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing some survival exercises!

Milk pumps, where mothers are compared to cows, divided the online opinion
A milk pump company split the argument by running an ad comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
To celebrate the launch of what has been called the world's first inflatable milk pump, consumer company Elvie released an ironic music commercial based on the video to show the freedom the device gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a barn with cows to a song that says, "Yes, I give myself away, but I don't have a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not my name, it's my breasts".
And he sang, "Give, give, I will nurse the children, give, give, I will give my wives".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a heated debate online.
It's been viewed 77,000 times and hundreds of comments, and the reaction to the video has been mixed, with many saying it's the horror of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad idea to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, only to have their babies taken away after a few days", wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump is hidden in her breastplate (Elvie/Mother)
One more comment: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who aren't having abortions?
And someone said, "That's such a bad ad".
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she thought it was funny.
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I wish I had one if I was breastfeeding.
Sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product", she wrote.
Another comment: A very entertaining commercial aimed at mothers who suck milk from a pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This ad is not about praising or condemning the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women are shown dancing with invisible milk pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of the ad campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is hidden under a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, allowing them to hold their babies and even leave the house while the pump is running.
Ana Ballari, partner and creative director at Mother, remarked, "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the sucking and the difficulty of milk, while also demonstrating in a fun and humorous way how a new milk pump will provide extraordinary freedom of movement.
This isn't the first time Elvie's milk pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway wearing a dress from Martha Jacobs, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transported to a tent camp at the Texas border
While the number of border crossings per month has remained almost unchanged, the number of detained child migrants has increased dramatically, in part because of the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration that have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid of jeopardizing their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased dramatically in June when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would be required to provide fingerprints and data to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, spoke to Congress about the agency's arrests of dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we keep going after people like that", said Mr. Albens.
To speed up processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, with the previous standard time frame of 60 days, according to shelter workers.
A lot of people will have to use video linking to file their own legal status with an immigration judge, instead of being in court in person.
Those deemed to have no grounds for assistance are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have surfaced in recent months, the longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to develop depression or increased anxiety, which can lead to outbursts of violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions like Tarnilla, these problems are much more pronounced, because signs of a child's distress are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent city without giving them time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends can make the trauma that many already face worse.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allem also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that has been raging in the country for eight years.
Muammar al-Assad, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and they will be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he said at a meeting of the Assembly.
Muallem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and a million displaced since 2011, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He announced that Damascus intends to continue this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, who are mostly acting as instructors and advisors to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
The French ground contingent in this war-torn country is more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Muammar al-Assad said conditions for return were favorable and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that keep refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return", he says.
They politicize a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped in its reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, home to three million people.
However, Muammar stressed that the agreement had "clear terms", and expressed hope that the military action would be directed against the jihadists, including the Nusra Front, which is linked to Al Qaeda, and that they would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the commission's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and cautioned against interference.
Why would Trump run for a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election, if, as many liberal observers hope, the impeachment and impeachment scandal do not end his presidency.
And this will be, without a doubt, the most dramatic presidential endgame in history!
At this point there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show drew 3.5 million viewers and topped cable ratings on the night of the top news.
"It's the fire that people are crawling towards because we don't understand it", says Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama "The Successor", about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nelly Scovell, the accomplished comedy writer and author of "Some Funny Details and a Few Harsh Truths About Breaking into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston just before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Miss Scovell told me.
Chaos is also valuable because it can be fun.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the storylines that come out of Washington can be as decisive as the future of Roe v. Wade, depending on whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch at six o'clock, as a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of off-the-record information in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a garment sewn with hubris, as The Washington Post put it), and the consequences of Storm Daniels' abrupt descriptions of, um, Mr. Trump's anatomy, it goes beyond simply wanting to be up to date.
I'm never going to watch Super Mario the same way I used to.
"Part of what he does is make you feel like you're watching a reality show he shows every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's changing cast and the constant twists and turns of the show.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, or you'll fall behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Flayes just this week, it was a hot, sunny day outside the windows of his house on the North Shore of Kauai, and it was 30 degrees Celsius, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, debating the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging by a thread.
I remember as a kid, when we were doing these crazy shows, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleace told me.
 I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.

External cash flows pour into a fierce primary race in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is inundated with money from a congressional redistricting bill that puts two candidates running for the same seat.
The newly painted Pittsburgh suburb surrounds Democrat House member Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different district in the primary last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that votes in old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district caused a decline in campaign funding by major party finance groups, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania after a hard-fought victory in a widely publicized by-election in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slight lead.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported Beijing's position, despite little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until partners evicted Trump's executive team.
The State Department has decided to recall U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in light of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only applied to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As their internal meetings wrapped up, the North and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that would have been a follow-up to a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step in efforts to curb immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively stopped the discussion of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favor of hosting the event.
And three US ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by another analyst close to the administration who also requested anonymity.
Teach history
The next step is the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, examples of which are now very compelling evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly called attention to the possibility of a conspiracy by the Trump campaign and Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to his constituents, and perhaps, ultimately, to a jury of his peers.
There are many reasons, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like his counterparts in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have a choice to make that will determine how long this fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, if only the West would resist and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed.
History is wrapped around these kind of turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Right now, Americans are facing some of these tipping points.
What happens when Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tough spot since the paper reported that he offered to secretly record the president's speech last year and questioned his fitness.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times' report is inaccurate.
How are we going to respond when the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault allegations and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these challenges, a long winter for democracy will come.
But I believe we will not be disappointed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the Rapid Vienna game.
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to secure a safe exit from Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers will be able to use this as a springboard.
"It was a crucial match for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent", the 31-year-old footballer said.
We started the game thinking we could get something, and we scored a point.
Maybe in the end we could have scored, but overall the draw was also a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second half, we got our act together and had the better half of the field.
Thursday is another big night for European football.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they showed good results in the last game, but with the crowd in the stands, I'm sure we can beat them and play well.
The past year has definitely been difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we have a sense of confidence.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the training is productive.
Hopefully, we can move forward, surpass last season's results and have some success.
Women are losing sleep over their retirement savings.
And even though the women in the survey had a pretty good idea of what kind of care they wanted for themselves, very few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they had talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to discuss it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
So here's a place to start.
Discuss this with your husband and children, because your family won't be willing to help you if you don't say what you want.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you can get medical care, because that choice can be a big cost-determining factor.
Involve a financial advisor in the discussion. he can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or you can insure your own life - as long as you have the money.
Deal with legal cases; anticipate legal battles.
Get a health care proxy to appoint a proxy to monitor your health care and ensure that your wishes are met by a professional in case you can't speak.
Also, consider the possibility of a financial trust.
Appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly father is in urgent medical need, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about illegal drugs and allergies?
Write down these details so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are involved, but also the professionalism of the doctors", adds Martin.
What kind of medication is needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan ahead.
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The man received several shots with a shotgun as he walked home at night.
The victim, 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. local time, as an "accidental incident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking for witnesses to contact them.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian officials were unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, a district north of Palo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Paula, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paula and Dongal in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala  regency, extending along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency is a lower administrative unit than a province, with a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important to the province, but is mostly concentrated in Moraval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the Palau and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is rocked by earthquakes regularly.
Below is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that slammed into the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: The city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra, was hit by a 7.6-magnitude earthquake.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the islands of Mentawai off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hits the Regency of Pidi Jai in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, contradicting reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in the Matanaska-Susitna detention center on a $500 bond.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "completely innocent" when asked if he admitted guilt, the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carries a maximum prison sentence of one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forging a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's abusive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of impact have been circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a beach festival in the city of Pau when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor's office is calling for a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City bombing
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saifov, a suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people -- a rare death sentence that hasn't been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipaov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck in October to hit a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify a death sentence, according to a death penalty intent notice filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saif deliberately beat eight people and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both offenses carry the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury stunned Saipov with a 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of murder for supporting a racket; a clause commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as the charge of assault and vehicular manslaughter.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "careful and deliberate planning" and used phrases such as "abominable, cruel and defamatory" to describe Saifov's crimes.
Saifullah Habibulayevich Saipav caused injuries, caused damage and caused loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lori Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Ernan Ferruccio, Ernan Diego Mendes and Alejandro Damiano Pagnola, reads the statement of intent.
Five of the dead were Argentine tourists.
It's been 10 years since the last capital punishment case was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in New York in a federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no guilt in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was enjoying his act.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching an ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked permission to hang an Islamic State flag in the hospital ward, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge, which consists of 22 counts.
David Patton, a federal public defender who represents Saipov, said they were "absolutely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the death penalty decision, rather than life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the pain of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
At a protest today at the Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the People's Army.
Former UKIP leader says politicians should feel uncomfortable with Eurosceptics since one of Theresa May's MPs has offered his candidacy for EU talks.
Conservative MP Peter Bown said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have been "out" already if Mr. Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced in trying to reconcile her divided supporters was compounded when the pro-EU Tories staged a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is desperately trying to keep the compromising Chequers Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and opponents of Brexit, as well as the EU itself.
The Allies insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the "Mistake".
Mr. Bone said at a rally in Solihull, "Leave Means Leave", that he wanted to kick Checker off the board.
He proposed that M. Farage be made an equal and entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would be out of here", he said.
The member for Wellingborough added: "I'm for Brexit, but we need to get back from the Chequers plan".
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't fight world wars to be dependent.
We want to follow our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue".
And the pro-Brexit and Tory Andrew Jenkins was also on the march, and she told reporters, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checker plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and activists who actually go out and vote for us.
Please abandon the plan and start listening.
In a sharp address to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers remain in office when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that politicians need to be made to feel uncomfortable when they are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a matter of trust between us, the people and the politicians", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "You're not getting away with this".
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make those of our politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that won us Brexit, and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security concerns they faced over the opening party programme.
"These are people who tell us that they can have ready to use IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the presidential race
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will "focus on the presidential race".
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a general assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election, facing Republican Jeff Deal, who was Trump's campaign co-chairman in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focus of discussion as a possible Trump rival in 2020.
Since Trump took office, this was the 36th meeting with voters in the General Assembly format, held Saturday afternoon in Halifax.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and that a woman needed to lead.
The arrest comes after the death of basketball player Sims of Louisiana State University.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that a suspect in the murder of USL basketball player Wade Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting asking for help identifying the man who was on it.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday morning outside the Southern University campus.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that led to his death, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wade defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to being at the scene, being armed, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) junior athlete who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Lewis Hamilton comes close to winning the World Championship after a team-wide win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas took over Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions inside the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas pulled a good seat on the stakes and almost left Hamilton to his own devices as he defended his spot in the first two turns and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to pit stop, leaving Hamilton to stagger to the end of the total mass, a maneuver that was to be decisive.
The Mercedes driver went to pit stop a lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after several round-in-round maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior space free, risking holding on after a double maneuver to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid on his 21st birthday and by the end of the first lap was seventh.
He then led most of the race as long as the tires held, because he wanted to finish fast, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
He eventually pit-stop on lap 44, but failed to increase speed on the remaining eight laps, so Räikkönen finished fourth.
It was a hard day, because Valtteri had all weekend performed fantastically and had shown himself a real gentleman, if I may say so.
"The team did a great job to finish first and second", Hamilton commented.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she was not the source of a leaked letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how "devious, disgusting and untrue" people can be.
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see bad, ugly, lying people", he said.
When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
That's not me.
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, is this your escape?
And remember her answer was, "You lost the paper".
No, no. I was just...
I had nothing.
Wait a minute.
We let a leak... no, we didn't", he added, cheering the senator on.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing the charges Ford had filed against Cowan, and he fled in early September. But Feinstein denied the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her story leak", Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked that the story be kept confidential, and I granted her request".
But her refusal probably didn't sit well with the president, who commented on it at a rally on Saturday: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
In continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the vile, the vile, and they don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to gain power and control", says Mediaite president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars  Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars recovered from Friday's defeat to Belfast Giants in the Elite League, winning the replay 5-3 at home on Saturday.
With a shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Baville, the Giants led by two shots in the opening.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were tied before Dwyer regained the lead.
François Bouchard of Dundee equalised, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the team's victory with two goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time this season; the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) from Kendall McFall to Dwyer, and four minutes later Bowie doubled the score from David Rutherford.
In the heated first period (13:10) Sullivan opened the scoring from the home side, and then Cowan equalised after a pass from Matt Markward (15:16).
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead going into the first half, scoring his second touchdown of the game late in the first period.
The receiving side regrouped, and Bouchard again tied the score, scoring a goal in the lead (27:37).
Coon and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period, and he secured the win along with the team's number five mid-final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their final home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies while saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia died heroically while ensuring the successful takeoff of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many more missing after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The tremors are still continuing, and many people are buried under the rubble in the city of Palo.
While his colleagues were fleeing, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower that was rocking wildly at the Paulo Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained in place until flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, detached from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided it was falling apart.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australian broadcaster ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirit, the dispatcher's decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts are broken", he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, and the disaster risk reduction agency says access to Donggala, Shiga and Buton is restricted.
The official news agency, Sutopa, said the death toll may rise as many bodies have yet to be recovered.
Waves of up to 20 feet (6 meters) devastated Pala, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in humanitarian aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "A fast car is bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what awaits them here.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the military, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation".
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by the Lamboca earthquake, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crashes in Micronesia
The airline that operated the flight that made the emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane, but now reports one passenger missing without a trace.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday it could not report the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately disclose details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water while trying to land at Chukchi Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unknown.
According to both the airline and the US Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Witnesses reported that the plane skipped the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane was flying very low.
"It's very good", said Janes.
He said he and others were able to get up to their waists in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was already sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing a nearby pier also helped with the rescue, using a inflatable boat to carry people to shore until the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in Papua New Guinea-registered plane crashes in the last 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst recovers the course of events on the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as a hired intelligence analyst.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location information from several cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statement.
When the reports that his cell phone was next to Chambers's phone at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford were confirmed, the police set out to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked Tallis if he was telling the truth about Sanford being in the van that night, he said he was lying because my van was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was Telis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
According to Rowlett, some time after Chambers died, Tallis deleted her texts, calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Haley said.
The defense is expected to begin the parties' arguments on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive settings.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, states that hip-hop has moved away from its roots: political statements and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey brought back bands like The Fugees and Common to popularity in the UK.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues married couple for racist post after firing
A nanny in New York City sues a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a random text message from her mother complaining that she's still black.
The couple denies being racist, equating the lawsuit to "extortion".
In 2016, Lindsay Placebo-Foxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"Neeeeeee, one more black", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she twice sent the message to Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Placa-Foxman was embarrassed to fire Ms. Morris, claiming that her former nanny, who was also African-American, was not doing well and that she was waiting for a Filipino instead.
Miss Morris was paid for a day's work and sent home by Uber.
Now Morris is filing a lawsuit and wants to get compensation for her dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: 350 dollars a day for six months with a residence permit.
"I want to show them that they can't do that", she told the Post on Friday. "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, arguing that firing Morris was a wise decision, given that they could not trust her after insulting her.
My wife sent her something she shouldn't have.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist, "posted" husband, Joel Plasco.
Would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if it was accidentally?
Your own baby?
Did you?
Placka equates the lawsuit to "extortion" and reports that his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
And you would pursue a man in that position?
"It's pretty tough", said the investment banker.
While the legal proceedings are still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, sharply criticizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not empathize with the talking bear, says a new leaflet.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's so interesting to read this, knowing the enormous success of Paddington.
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he decided to write a children's book about a teddy bear, was optimistic despite the lackluster reception of his work, and that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was bitterly sweet after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, speaking of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a very quiet man, and not a very boastful one", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a parental honor for a child who had accomplished something: you're proud of them, even though you didn't really get the credit.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation, a product of his imagination, he always gave Paddington his due.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
"Nad called regularly to tell me that things were really bad, that she couldn't take it anymore", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I called Over to tell her that she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors were giving her to keep her heart beating was slowly leaving her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the very end.
I just had to sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't whine, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laporte, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers -- and they had no idea what she had been through.
"No one knew", she said.
I bowed my head and tears ran down my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I was overcome with the feeling of compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning hanging up postcards to warn of suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones, who have committed suicide, who are doing everything they can to stop other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hanging up cards with warm words and phone numbers for people to call for help on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he developed depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want other parents to feel the way I do", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Sydney, said her son was a gifted chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew his smile.
People said his smile would light up any room.
But before he died, he quit because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the unpleasant consequences".
Ms. Davis created the flashcards so people would know that there are people in the world that you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet  you need to talk.
Mrs. Husfrid, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was sad or that he was depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day, he was very depressed because when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
She said that his death was a huge trauma, but they had to live with it, and it was a huge hole in our family.
It's just killing us.
But you have to keep fighting and keep living.

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI investigates
"I thought we could have what he wants" "limited in time and scope of investigation" "we can get some unity", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was collapsing" "because it was actually stuck in traffic".
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is sometimes explained.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 -- if the Republicans are expected to lose, then they will be weakened in their efforts to elect the candidate they want to the Supreme Court.
George Bush called the senator to lobby Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There's a vote in the Senate, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains to be seen if Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue of equality and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has declined under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo-sun, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reasons are the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the higher prices smugglers charge for transshipment.
Pyongyang has not commented on this.
Most North Korean defectors eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South  who are technically still at war  have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed in common terms to work towards completely denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and in such a situation, we will not be the first to disarm", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a hysterical, she says he shouldn't be running for Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and said his temperament was not a good fit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Publishing Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the sexual harassment allegations against Dr. Christina Blaze Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and could not speak when discussed by his family and senior class of the school.
He also explicitly blamed the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and organized assassination of a person" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's speech showed he couldn't run for the Supreme Court because he had clearly shown his bias against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would seek impeachment of Kavanaugh if he is elected and if the Democrats win a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: If he's not telling the truth in Congress or at the FBI, then not only should he not be on the Supreme Court, but he shouldn't be on the court where he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for hysterical, unbiased individuals to sit in a courtroom and expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And a woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified impeachment speech, months and years of anger just pouring in, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years ago.
I don't think it's that rare.
And she went on to say, "I was really helped by this woman who was a director somewhere, and she said that when she was angry, she cried, but she had developed a technique, and when she was angry and started crying, she would say, 'You probably think I'm sad because I cry.
But I'm mad.
And I just kept talking.
I think it was great.
Tears are allowed in part as an expression of grief, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job was crying in unspeakable anger when I was grabbed by the collar by an elderly woman -- a reserved boss who always scared me a little bit -- and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let yourself be seen in tears", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they'll be happy to have you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt was caught cheating on a yacht called Monkey Business and dropped out of the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, thought she might as well get involved in the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a very smart decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates, and they didn't need me.
Some have called this situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign had been going on for quite some time, she was short of funds, so she said she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turns out that some of her fans who donated $1,000 to the man actually gave her only $250.
"They think I'm going with a drop?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not run, she was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so hard to get money and focused on voters instead of candidates, and anger at sexism -- that she was breathless.
"You might think I'm having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled the press reaction to her condition.
You would think that my corporate sponsor is a Kleenex paper napkin manufacturer.
I used to wonder, "What will they write on my tombstone?"
"She was crying"?
Why a Sino-US trade war might be good for Beijing
The initial outbursts of the China-US trade war were deafening, and as the war is far from over, the long-term disagreements between the two countries could be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on China's major exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, when new tariffs hit goods worth a total of $200 billion, effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing has responded in this way, recently raising tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised the United States a symmetrical response, and its second-largest economy is unlikely to fail.
It takes a lot of thought to make Washington back down, but publicly bowing to the United States is almost unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the best of the situation, the pressure of the US trade war could benefit China in the long run, reducing the two countries' interdependence.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a process of abrupt economic collapse is far more dangerous than observers previously thought", said Abigail Grace, an assistant Asia researcher at the New American Security Research Center.
Syria ready to welcome refugees back, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome refugees back and calls for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to return to normal life.
We now have the facilities to return refugees to the countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and target economic measures that were designed to improve their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept any aid in exchange for conditions or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in a suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. will lose for the sixth time in a row on European soil and haven't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown when the team of Dutch captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, which was enough to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought the most in the tournament, drove his ball into the water on 3 pair of the 16th hole, giving up that match to Francesco Malinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to pass this field with a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was beaten 5-4 by the lowest rated player in the European team, Thornhorn Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the player with the most career wins in the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so excited to return the cup.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, shocked after the European team's win.
He handed the relay to his compatriot John Rham, who on Sunday beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match.
"I'm very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, a man whose career I've followed since I was a kid", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A stunning statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was fighting each other except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Shadow Finns, who played top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys. They're fighters.
This morning, we sometimes showed Europe what we are capable of.
We fought.
Let's take our hats off for Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players were very good.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We were outplayed.
