The A.M. of Whales was concerned about the look of a whip.
Some AMs are concerned about the suggestion to change their title to MWPS (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It arose due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AAMs of the entire political sphere were worried that this could lead to ridicule.
1 One worker said that his group was concerned about the compatibility of TWP and PWP2.
For readers outside of Whales: Whales TWP stands for fool and PWP stands for P.
Plaid AM said the whole group was not happy and suggested options.
The conservative from Whales said his group was open-minded about the name change, but noted that the MPWP literally jumped to the pimp.
In this perspective the pronunciation of the Whale letter is the same as the Yorkshire English letter U.
The Assembly Commissioner who drafted the law for the name change said: Any description of what the members of the Constituent Assembly will be called will definitely be the final decision of the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Legislative Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public consultation on proposals that identified widespread support for the Assembly to be known as the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission favoured the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs in the matter of the AM title, but the MWP option had the most support in the public consultation.
The AM seems to be suggesting alternative options, but getting a consensus on the raw draft legislation regarding the changes to be submitted in a week from which it is expected can be a headache for the authoritative official, Elaine Jones.
The amended Act will incorporate other changes to the way the Assembly works, including the rules for disqualification of AM and the design of the committee system.
When the A.M. discusses the law, they will have the final vote on the question of what name they should be known by.
The Macedonians will hold elections for a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous referendum was organized to resolve a decades-old rift with neighboring Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would not consider the referendum.
Nevertheless, supporters of the referendum, including Chief Minister Zoran Zev, argued that the name change was just the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's were silenced as churches in Harlem were in trouble.
"Historically, the elderly people I spoke to said that there were bars and churches on every corner", Mr Adams said.
Today, there is no tomorrow.
He said that the bar disappearing is understandable.
Nowadays, people socialize differently, he said.
"Now there will be no longer a bar next to residential houses where people go regularly.
Because he was worried about the churches that the money from the property sale would not last as long as the leaders wanted, and sooner or later they would get back to where they started.
He added that condominium apartment buildings filled with people who do not help the rest of the holy places in the neighborhood could replace churches.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be poor", he said, "and so the day is not far away when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that most people who come to these condominiums will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a Black metropolis - a decade after the Metropolitan Community, St. Martin, in 1870.
The original white Methodist congregations were leaving in 1930.
Black congregations praying nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was occupied by black congregations led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted retailers on 125th Street, the main street to shop in Harlem, who objected to keeping or encouraging black people.
A fire in 1939 caused much damage to the building, but the priests of Father Johnson began ringing bells as they planned to do reconstruction work.
Father Johnson's father, the Rev. David Johnson, and St. Martin's successors proudly identified Dhannad as the bell of the poor.
The experts who rang the bell in July called it something else: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical tools".
University of Michigan expert, Tiffany NG noted that it was the world's first phenomenon to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years earlier had been attending the big Carillion at a riverside church.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin did not take his place.
What has been happening with St. Martin for the past few months has been a story of complex sculptures and contractors, some brought in by the raw leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
WESTRI - The parish governing body, made up of raw leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was not involved in hiring sculptors and contractors sent by the diocese despite wanting to pass the expense.
Some priests complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old man in a lobster dive in California.
A 13-year-old boy in California was diving for clams on Saturday when a shark attacked and injured him on the first day of the clam season opening, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 am near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammell told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then he pedalled towards it with the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamle said that at first he thought it was just a crab-catching craze, but then he realized that he was shouting, I understood a little!
I was a little bit confused!
Her entire bone was opened, Hamel said, when she noticed the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: "There are sharks in the water!"
The boy was airlifted to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed on the critical list.
The species of shark responsible for attacking was unknown.
Life-saving Captain Larry Giles told the media that the shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Gilles added that the victim sustained severe injuries to the upper thigh.
Investigation and safety purpose officers closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Isinitas for 48 hours.
Gills noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's plans pushed the UK beauty market
The style beautician is keeping the Sainsbury Boots, Superdrugs and Davenhams in the department store with the assistant staff.
As a lasting push into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which has been growing steadily while sales of fashion and homeware have been declining, the big beauty items will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, taken to more stores.
Investing in beauty is used as ways to use the exercise spaces reserved for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of the beauty products it offers to 3,000 items, including Revlon, Essai, Twizzerman and Dr. Paapa for the first time.
L'Oréal's current ranges of Mabeline and Bruts Biz will also be seen in shops like Boots, which will have more space in branded areas.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range so that most items are vegan-friendly - which is growing in demand among small shoppers.
In addition, two perfume retailers will be experimenting with offering discounted fragrance shops at Sunbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week while the second is due to open in Saleigh Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and buying small amounts of daily food from local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do a lot to keep people visiting.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Cope, said that department stores appear to be growing as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against discount-giving Aldi and Liddy with more services and non-food.
Since Sanbaris brought in both chains two years ago, Argos has been running stores in thousands of stores and has launched a number of settlements, which is said to have provided a foundation for grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to improve their beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
In the early 2000s Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots, but the alliance ended up over how to split part of the revenue from the chemist's store in their supermarkets.
New strategies have come since three years ago when Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Salesian, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
He said four stores would play a role in the planning by expanding the luxurious range of their skincare brands including Lloyds La Roche-Pose and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director, Sainsbury's, said: "We have improved the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance the atmosphere for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be helpful in advising.
Our brand range is set to meet all the needs and the pleasant atmosphere and convenience of places, meaning we are now a destination for beauty products that challenge the old style of shopping.
Peter Jones becomes a jinn after Holly Willoughby pulls out of a £11 million deal.
When TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal, Dragons Dan star Peter Jones was keen to take his lifestyle brand business to Mark & Spencer and ITV.
Villaghabai doesn't really have time for her own homeware and accessories brands.
The business of Piers was merged with the Gwyneth Paltrow Group brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce she was leaving.
At the last minute, Holly Willoughby put Dragons Dan star Peter Jones in trouble by pulling out of the attractive lifestyle brand business to focus on her new big deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Merlo was shocked at his empire headquarters in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV's Golden Girl admitted in a tense meeting that she had made a new deal worth £1.5 million - meaning she didn't really have time for her homeware and accessories brands.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Group brand and doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
Since Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce she was actually leaving, Jones has been heading out of Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
Sources said: "It is really the most important holiday of Holi till now.
It was going to be her long-term future in which she could see herself for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, how close it was to starting.
The warehouse at Merlo headquarters was packed with goods ready for sale
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, who is one of the most trusted stars in Britain, this morning could cost the company millions due to heavy delays in the range from cushions and candles to clothing and homeware, and could delay its launch in the future.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother and husband of three willoughby Dan Baldwin Jones and his wife Tara Capp were close for ten years.
Willoughby actually set up in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
With some holidays, Gali and Jones own 40% of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby became a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I Am Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones said that last night we did not comment on his business affairs.
Tough Talk and Then We Fell in Love
He joked that the news media would criticize him for making the comments, some calling it "unexpected" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do so much?
Trump said it in the voice of a news reader.
I did nothing wrong.
It noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump arranged an opening meeting in Singapore in June, a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But, the negotiations to abolish nuclear collapsed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top envoy, R.I. Young Ho, told the general assembly of global leaders at the U.N. on Saturday that North Korea was not seeing a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to its early disarmament measures.
Instead, it noted, the U.S. has begun to grant targeted approvals to keep up the pressure.
Trump expressed a great deal of optimism during his speech at the rally.
"We are doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were moving towards war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now, we have this amazing connection.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded good results - rocket tests stopped, hostages were helped to be released and the rest of the US troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to get the presidency, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get in from this closed battlefield, we have 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing thousands.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need it.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for seeking international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international help, so, it was a bit challenging", Ms. Sumba said.
Save the Children is trying to get to Palu, but it is not certain whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of National Disaster Agency said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can be given a break to contribute to the relief efforts.
The way the soil of Indonesia is constantly shaking, the country is sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
This is a sight not commonly seen on the coast when tsunami shelters are built in Aceh.
Although the warning is in effect, there is apparently a possibility of loss of life due to the lack of a siren warning of tsunami in Palo.
At the best of times, traveling to many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make systems more complex.
A hospital ship is in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's decaying infrastructure a major issue in his election campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has put Mr Joko's administration in a state of concern as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from prolonged sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative forms of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool deep dive match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London to save Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a 30-yard pass from outside from Khedran Shakiri as his team was 1-0 behind Chelsea.
He caught the ball with his left hand before hitting a shot towards a distant post.
This attempt got the box out of the top as it crashed into the upper right corner of the grid.
Finally the ball jumped and fell on the ground and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball and a player like Shaq always plays as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolIFC.COM.
I saw Kante coming and touching and couldn't think about it much and just took a shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead of Belgian star Aidan Hazard at half time after scoring in the 25th minute.
Matthew Kovesić returned to the game before the Blue Striker stopped spinning in the middle of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic was moving fast through the middle of the field.
He then threw a beautiful throw, which put Hazard ahead of the box.
Hazard emerged from the defence and ended up in the far post net with a left foot shot and overtook Liverpool's Alison Baker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Studio Paolo in Naples, Italy.
UEFA will face Chelsea Wedded in Europe at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that were brought down by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and waves that swelled as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32 year old man on suspicion of murder after woman dies
A murder investigation was launched after the woman's body was found at Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found with a fractured wound at 7.55am on John Street in Grayson Moss, from whom a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged those in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Intelligence Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have caught anything in the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local of Birkenhead and she was found inside the property.
This afternoon friends who seem to know the woman came to the scene this morning to ask questions about where she met.
The investigation is underway as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's next family.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, was still trying to return to his flat but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He couldn't say anything when he realized what had happened.
Now, residents have been told that it will take hours to allow them to go inside.
A male police officer was heard saying that the whole area is now seen floating around the crime scene.
A woman with tears was seen at the scene.
She kept saying that she was very hateful.
At 2 pm two police vans were inside the encircled area with one van stuck outside.
A number of officers were standing inside the siege and guarding the block of flats.
Anyone with information was asked to report to DM@MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with reference to log 247 dated 30th September.
The statue of Cromwell Parliament has become a famous modern memorial for rewriting history.
His exile will be poetic justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works, such as the Taliban created by his religious holy followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the current debate over the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither commanded nor drawn by Cromwell.
Perhaps a false Cromwell would have been sacrificed in the previous century for the footsteps of his ancestor Thomas.
Sir William H. Thorncroft's brilliant representation of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century thought and a chronicle of a personality that many still consider important to celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was remembered as the protector of Parliament against many external pressures, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, in his case certainly monarchy.
Whether or not it is an accurate representation is a matter of historical debate.
It is certain that the schism of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was the admirable figure who represented one side of that part.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
The pig murders the moles Chinese farmer died
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his surname Zhao Yun, was found near the stage after reports on Sunday morning with a broken artery and covered in blood at a market in the southern Chinese region of Guizhou.
A pig farmer preparing to give vaccination injections to pigs at Hogri in the Xining of Qinghai region of China on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly came from Yunnan area with his nephew on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door to the neighbor's pigsty was open.
He said that the big pig in the stall was with his mouth full of blood.
Forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin's feet were bloody and torn, his cousin, referred to as his surname, Vu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
In the security camera footage, Yaoun was seen entering the market to feed his pigs at 4.40 am on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The beast that smote him was not of his own flesh, nor of his own flesh.
When police gathered evidence from the scene, the market operator told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking.
Yoon's family and market officials appeared to be negotiating compensation for the death.
Although there are exceptions, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the male.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig stuffed a Whale farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the janitor away.
After eating an Oregon farmer by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can make them "furious".
They are just playful.
They're knipers, very curious... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to respect them in the right way, he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern US.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes through the cold waters of Mexico.
However, the rain will bring flood-like rainfall to the entire northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a category 1 hurricane as of Sunday eastern time, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
By then, the hole in the Pacific Ocean has begun to form and is moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. Rosa Baja will arrive on the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday and begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in areas of Mexico.
After that, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west region over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause dangerous flooding conditions, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in the southwest area, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the diffuse nature of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of sudden flooding with rapidly catastrophic conditions.
The advice to venture out into the desert on foot under the threat of tropical rain will be considered bad advice.
Heavy rains can cause valleys to become flowing rivers and storms bring local stormy winds and dust will fly.
The arriving trophy will bring some local-level heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
A cool half inch of rain is likely which could cause small debris streams and narrow roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the area.
Some sporadic showers will start arriving late on Sunday and early on Monday in Arizona before the rain becomes more extensive on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the four corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
Throughout the U.S. there may be some extreme temperature swings in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in a short time.
Sunday is the best example of a dramatic change in temperature in the central U.S.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the delayed summer heat will try to build up and re-spread.
Much of the central and western U.S. will see a warm start in October that will reach 80s wide from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first quarter of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by over 20 million people.
Thursday's testimony on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and her alleged sexual assault in 1980, Christine Blesse, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's last-minute turn, by which time, the political stand-off had begun: the deal drawn up by the Arizona Senate. Jack Flake will conduct a weeklong investigation of the charges for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh caught her drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in hasty testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the air as recorded by Nielsen.
The company had average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network which showed it.
And Nielsen usually had some trouble-measuring people who looked in the offices.
To put it in perspective, this audience was the size of a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
The Fox News channel whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day of the hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest grew after the hearing.
Flake was the man in the center in the Friday drama.
After the central Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras barking at protesters as he was heading to the elevator for a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as it was being produced, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
She was told, "You have power where many women are weak.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the lift closed that he had a lot to tell the committee that was hearing.
When the entire Senate was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination by the Justice Committee, all cable and broadcast networks were covering live broadcast hours.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week that the minority Democrats were requesting.
Flack was somewhat persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon.
After a dialogue with Coons and some of the senators after him, Flack made his decision.
Flack had the power to choose because it was apparent that the Republic could not allow Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opens FBI investigation into allegations made against Kavanaugh.
The British PM could accuse Brexit critics of playing politics.
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Times newspaper could accuse her of playing politics with Britain's future and ignoring the national interest in return for the tick-tock allegations about her leaving the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa Birmingham may attend the Conservative Party conference in the UK on 29 September 2018.
In a post-interview interview on the front page of the newspaper, she attacked herself by telling her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson of the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "completely illogical".
Ved Sims shooting: Police arrested suspected Dayton Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police arrested 20-year-old basketball player, Ved Sims, on LSU for the fatal shooting of a suspect.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims' glasses were lost during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS affiliate WABB reports.
After questioning Sivyasan, the police said he confessed to fatally shooting Waid.
His bond was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Corner office issued a preliminary report on Friday, which stated that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head inside the throat.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and civilians who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the area's law enforcement for their continued responsibility and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
Botton grew up a 6-foot-6 forward in Roanoke where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken up" and "in shock" due to Wade's death.
"This is what you are always worried about", said the Vedas.
A volcano has blown ash over Mexico City.
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Management on Saturday warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcano for 24 hours after activity intensified at the mouth and 183 gases and ash began to escape.
The center was monitoring multiple sounds and vibrations.
Photos circulating on social media showed a thin layer of ash frozen on car airtightness in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geologists noted increasing activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police clashed with Catalan separatists.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police who stopped the riots and thousands joined a revenge demonstration on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation over partition.
A group of masked people supporting the separatists who were pushed back by riot police threw eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust on streets normally crowded with tourists.
The police used their rods to stop the clashes, after which the crowd also broke loose later in the day.
For several hours, anti-independence groups chanted 'no pardon, no pardon' which was met by the united protestors shouting 'May Spain live forever'.
Fourteen people were treated for ordinary injuries sustained during the protest, the local press reported.
Tension remains high in the pro-independence sector even a year after the October 1 referendum, a referendum that is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to be independent, however, voters were few as those who were opposed to partition largely boycotted the vote.
According to several authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voters from going to polling booths in all areas where violent clashes took place.
Anti-independence groups pitched tents out overnight on Friday to stop protests in favor of the national police
There were protests but they had to take a different path.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote but now we are trapped,' he said.
Despite the special arrangement of regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties of Catalonia have had difficulty sustaining that frenzy this year as many of their prominent leaders have either gone into self-imposed exile or are in prison and awaiting trial over their role in holding the referendum and then declaring independence.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests in favor of the police on his phone, said the riots were instigated by politicians from both parties.
"It was getting more and more stressful", he said.
A prisoner in pre-trial detention from the back of the last year, Oriol Junqueras announced on Saturday that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to restore democratic values and condemn the repression we have faced from the Spanish government", he said.
London: Man arrested after car broke into house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeated car intrusions into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at approximately 19:30 BST on Thursday in Belinagrad Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blamming, who investigated, said that the doors and the building were also damaged.
At some point a car can also catch fire in a crossbow.
Manga Strike led Livingston to a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Mangan's first goal for Livingstone secured the win
The excited Livingstone stunned the Rangers as it was only the second defeat in Steven Gerrard's 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's strike proved to be the difference between the two as Grey Holt's team went one level ahead of Habernia in the second.
The Gerrards were far from victory in this season of the Premiership and next Sunday they will face the leaders who are eight points behind them.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone will continue their undefeated run in the six-game division, with Holt yet to taste defeat after taking over from head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone will lose chances against visitors without edges
Holt's team should have been far ahead before they scored, his directness was troubling Rangers all the way.
Scott Robinson was completely broken but continued his effort against the goal, after which only Alan Lithgow managed to lead his effort after sliding Craig Holcutt's header around to meet the goal.
The hosts had the material to let the Rangers play against them, they knew they could get the visitors in trouble piece by piece.
And so the important goal came.
Rangers accepted the free-kick and Livingstone worked on the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining to set up Megha who touched and scored from the middle of the box.
By that point, Rangers had maintained a hold on the position but the home defense was unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had largely nothing to do.
The second half started off in this way, although Alfredo Morelos was forced to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's foot and a Livingston player, set for the game, hit a wide by Lithgow.
Livingstone's box was constantly being crossed and he also went out with two penalties for pushing away a handball after a challenge by Halcott to substitute player Glenn Middleton.
"The most important thing is to be able to see the world through the eyes of the people". - John F. Kennedy
Elsdale Lemont of BBC Scotland on the playing field of Tony McAaro.
An extraordinary look and result by Livingstone.
For one man, he was amazing, and the expectations from him were starting to rise.
His playing style and players have hardly changed since he has been playing his best, but he is highly credited for the way he has coached the team since Holt.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halcott handled the beautifully arranged defense very well while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell constantly on the prowl.
However, the Rangers were less motivated.
They were good as long as they were under Gerrard, they were below his standards.
Their final ball was missing - only once did they open the home team - and it was time to wake up for the Rangers who saw themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and brown skies on the faces on Saturday as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They highlighted issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan later moved to Kologne for the inauguration of the new massive mosque.
It is the most populous city outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for stopping a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but several supporters gathered nearby to see their leader.
Thousands of protesters opposed Erdogan - many of them Kurds - but their voices were heard both by Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to include him in the country.
The dueling protests depicted the visitor as a divider, hailed as a hero by some German Turks and vilified by others as a hermit.
Deptford road crash: A cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the city's south-east.
The driver of the car was standing and paramedics examined him, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came a month after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run incident on Children's Street, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roads have been closed and bus routes diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid these routes.
Long Latyn Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured after unrest in a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.2
The breakdown occurred at around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers have been brought in to bring about the unrest, including eight residents and one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: Special trained prison staff have been appointed to tackle the problem of MMMP long lattices.
Six members of staff are being treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and sent to jail for a long time.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most notorious criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October, riot control officers were called to jail to deal with a serious riot last year in which workers were attacked with a pool ball.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City threatened with flash floods due to Hurricane Rosa (drought affected areas may benefit)
Tropical pressure rarely strikes Arizona, but something similar is going to happen early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa has made its way across the southwest desert, posing a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set up a flash flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and western Arizona in Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
On Tuesday Rosa is expected to make a direct route to Phoenix, which will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have created storms or tensions within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ limit.
Advanced National Hurricane Center models have predicted rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with a sprinkling of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other desert areas of the south-west including the Central Rockies and Great Basin are expected to experience rainfall of 1 to 2 inches with a scattered 4 inches.
Out of the many areas that are at risk of flooding, the rain of roses can be a blessing as the region is drought-stricken.
While the floods are a matter of great concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be of benefit as the South-West is currently facing a drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second largest category, as reported by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With maximum winds of 85 mph with a hurricane capacity Sunday morning, Rosa is still 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is coming into contact with cold waters in the Pacific and is therefore decreasing in intensity.
As such, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico at the speed of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall could occur across Mexico, posing a risk of severe flooding.
3 to 6 inches of cool rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, rising to 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then make its way north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning before making its way south into Utah by Tuesday night, passing Arizona.
Major damage is expected from the storm or its remnants, with very heavy rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest, the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods as well as avalanches in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midmor Norton attack: four arrested in attempted murder
A 16-year-old man has been arrested in Somerset on suspicion of attempted murder of three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man after he met with a gunshot wound.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Redstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
The officials have requested everyone who has any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered, that is, the wrath of the Democratic Party
"Vote for Judge Kavanaugh means reject the Democratic Party's harsh and offensive tactics", Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh endured the Democratic Party's minimization, anger, and hypocrisy throughout the entire nomination process.
Before Kavanaugh was tried before Congress on Thursday, Christine Blaise forcefully and emotionally denied the allegations made by Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades earlier when he was a teenager.
Ford was also examined during the charges hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day, the American people showed brilliance and quality and courage of bravado.
"A vote for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for confirmation of the most complete legal mind of our time, a jurist with a certified record of public service", he told the West Virginia supportive crowd.
The President made specific reference to Kavanaugh's nomination on the importance of turning the Republican Party in the midterm elections.
Five weeks away from the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, he said.
That is why I am fighting for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to deter and deter.
The first key procedural vote in the House on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Thousands of people have been killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, the number is still rising
At least 384 people have died when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, leaving many stranded after large waves hit the coast, officials said Saturday.
On the beach of Paul City when waves six meters (18 feet) high came ashore on Friday evening, thousands of people gathered on the shore to celebrate the festival, the waves dragged many to their deaths and destroyed everything in their path.
7.5 Tivratha earthquake followed by tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the shore and did not immediately flee and suffered", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come by itself, it hit cars, logs, houses, land and anything else that hit it, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled at 800 kph (497 mph) across the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
In Palo, about 16,700 people were evacuated and held in 24 centres.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, pools turned and collapsed and water surrounding the mosque.
Saturday the coastal city began to shake with post-earthquake tremors
The area of 2.4 million people experienced series of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in its statement that the energy released by Friday's devastating earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical situation of the city, which terminates on the shores of a long narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were trapped under the roofs of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that an additional 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Ngroho said that the loss of life and property could be greater in the area known as Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) off the northern coast of Palu, which is close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications in Donggala are "completely broken, no information", Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could get worse", he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami in Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
Footage released on social media shows a man from the top floor of the building shouting a warning of an approaching tsunami to people down the street.
In minutes, a water-like wall collides with the shore and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the instant footage.
The earthquake and tsunami released widespread force that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military from Jakarta and other cities began sending cargo planes with relief supplies, officials said, but the displaced still desperately need food and basic necessities.
The city airport is open for relief operations only and will remain closed till October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arranged a visit to the relief centres.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reached 800.
It is very bad.
While World Vision staff reached safely from Donggala to Palo City where staff were sheltered in Tadpatri shelters in their office premises, they witnessed scenes of devastation along the way, said Mr. Dosebba.
"They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed", he said.
It is very bad.
Even when the relief groups started disaster relief operations, Amuk complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers were also prevented from entering Palo.
According to Indonesian laws, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only come if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Auliya Arria, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster, we can open up international aid, but that is not the case yet".
The night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami came to Paul, so those whose friends and families were still missing were sitting in hope that miracles would happen to their loved ones or that reckless stories of natural disasters would be told.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been crushed under the body of her mother who had been next to her for two days.
Jendon Subandon, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were signaled from Indonesia earlier this month.
Among others trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, those Mr. Mandagi had included were his students.
As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how hours after the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed, news was reported in the paragliding community, who were sending WhatsApp messages to the Palo Harfones who were attending the Beach Festival.
However, instead of two brown checks, his message contained only one grey check.
"I think it means the messages didn't get through", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling an ATM at Newport in Levi
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning at Newport in Levy while BRINK workers were filling ATMs, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car at the entertainment complex was emptying the ATM and preparing to overpay, Danish McCarthy wrote in the news release.
While he was busy, another male ran after Brink's employee and stole the delivery bag.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding his identity should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to -Y.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formally known as Kanye West.
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a time and used the moniker title for his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance at the Saturday night live show where he is to launch his new album Yandy.
She replaced singer Ariane Grande on the show, which was cancelled for emotional reasons, the show's creators said.
As well as a pun on his current profession, West had previously said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think that 'Yeah' is a word that is used a lot in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you'", West radio host Big Boy Sy said earlier this year while discussing his album.
So, I am you, I am us, it is us.
It removed the cliché that had only one meaning, that only showed our good, our bad, our misunderstanding everyone.
This album sheds more light on what we are.
He is one of a number of rappers who have changed their names.
Sin Combs was variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year released his preferred name as Love and Brother Love.
A previous West collaborator, Jay-Z, also did the hyphen with or without capital.
Mexico's AMLO has pledged not to use military force against any civilians.
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the bloody uprising against students.
Lopez Obrador will never use the military to suppress Mexicans at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday
As the leftist student movement was taking root across Latin America, soldiers opened fire on protesters demonstrating peacefully in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at the time.
Lopez Orbador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more public universities
He said that lack of employment and educational opportunities are shifting youths to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double AI funding.
As China becomes more entrenched in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research being done in that area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investigator and AI practitioner who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after AI announcements by various parts of the US government, that there is a lack of formal AI strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we look forward to further success in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, invested in China's most important AI company, Face++.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that could beat America's top-ranked Othello player, and then he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee welcomed the technology competition like the previous U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants, Lee said.
It is not China that is taking away academic leaders; it is corporates, Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited brilliant people from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. increase its AI efforts, Lee said.
I think that those who do PhD in AI should be given green cards automatically.
China's State Council released its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
Just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund U.S. researchers, China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For NFS, it currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Until then, no action has been seen in U.S. law for months to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote for a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve decades-old disputes with Greece that led to their bid for membership in the European Union and NATO being blocked.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that of its northern neighbor. The name refers to its claim to its territory and was prevented from entering NATO and the EU using vetoes.
In June the two governments made a deal on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the name change would diminish the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Selvic majority population.
President Gyorgy Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum would come out to vote.
Question on the reading of the ballot for the referendum: 'Did you accept the agreement with Greece and gain membership of NATO and the EU?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zev, argued that the price was justified for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, and for its role in institutions like NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live independently under the roof of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Giorgivesca, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough people in Parliament said they would stick to the outcome of the vote to reach a decision.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1 pm there were no reports of irregularities.
However, in the last parliamentary election of 2016 when 66 per cent of the total registered voters cast their ballots, only 16 per cent of the people came to the polls alone, compared to 34 per cent.
"I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old voter Gjos Tnevsky in the capital, Skopje.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their votes in a referendum to change the name of the province of Macedonia, paving the way for it to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Karvadarkov was setting up a small stage and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through service", Cavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are honored.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can become like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think a large majority will be in favour of it because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zev said after casting his vote.
He said that the results will ensure our future.
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the requirement.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were considering voting on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes they would vote.
A referendum needs 50 percent plus one vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum will be the first blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took over the government on May 2 last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates the whole of Brighton's defence for the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have defended Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it seem comically easy in his score of 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between three of Brighamton's defenders before hitting open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
The Brighton box's corner was more often outrunning it before it was wrung around a defender.
After that, he passed to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero who used his right boot with a shot to the right of the right net to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero was experiencing some problems with his leg, city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
55, 60 minutes we talked about his game.
It has happened.
We were lucky to score him at that time".
But it was Sturlin who benefited the Sky Blues in the early days of the Premier League scudetto.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball into Brighton Deep in that game.
He sent the ball through a beautifully thrown to Leroy Seine with the left flank.
Sein made a few touches before leading Serling to the away post.
The Sky Blues sent the ball into the net before it was taken further out of bounds.
Tuesday at 12:55 am the Hoffenheim City fights in the Champions League group at the Rahn-Necker-Arena in Sinnheim, Germany.
Spoiler wants to play Chaser against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off contention, there was no good reason to force another start.
But the always-competitive Chaser is hoping for a round against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the playoff has an impact for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have confirmed a wild-card spot with at least one 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to lock-up their first-class title.
Even if we're not playing to achieve anything, at least we can toast the rubber, knowing that here in Denver the atmosphere with the crowd and other forces will probably play to the highest level that any face-off this year will.
Why do I not want to compete?
The Nationals are yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly in the process of allowing Schäzer to pitch in such a situation.
Schäzer, who will make his 34th start, will have a bullpen session on Tuesday and pitch on his remaining regular Sundays.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
When the President spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections, he gave a synthesis of the surrounding situation on the election of his Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Everything we did in November is felt on the stakes.
The most important decisions of our lifetime are five weeks away.
This is one of many big ones, big -- I am running but I am really running so I am fighting for the best prospects everywhere.
Trump said, "You see this terrible, desperate group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by using tools in any way, you see the greed and the corruption.
They don't know who they are actually hurting, and who they are crushing to gain power and control, so they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats are on a mission to "opposite and obstruct", he said.
And you see that in the last four days, he called the Democrats "angry and ugly and evil and lying".
He gave the Senate Judiciary Committee a Democratic Senate rank. Diane addressed Feinstein, who received a standing ovation from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak a document?
Yeah, yeah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a comprehensive church.
It is intolerable for those who speak their minds
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly surprising.
I am the latest amongst the Labour MPs to say that you are not welcome - everyone is saying for our own sake.
My fellow MP, John Ryan, was treated in this way because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by censor press for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the same issues that Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders because of the irony.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
Like most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were similar.
Today, sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings and the mystery of kind, humble politics has long been forgotten, although it has actually begun.
It has been observed that the Labour Party does not tolerate dissent and that each consultation is evaluated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague with whom I had previously formed a similar political vision, they were expecting me to take a U-turn and take positions that I would never agree to - whether it be on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I give a public speech - and it really makes no difference what I say - a harsh comment on social media is followed by a call about my not being elected, rejecting the politics of the Centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And my experience is not the same.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I am dedicated to the professionalism and determination of those professionals who face gender and racist ideology every day but never get embarrassed.
The most disappointing aspect of this era of politics is how the level of oppression has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and the party is getting smaller with every motion of no confidence or change in the election rules.
I have been advised many times in the last two years that I should focus on keeping my head down, not being so moody and then I will be successful.
But this is not what I came to politics to do.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that left my extensive schooling behind, I have sought support for the best public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
In the last election, I never hid my politics.
Nottingham East could not in any way be confused with my policy views, and the current leadership in the area of disagreement.
I will say to those who will be promoting the motion on Friday that as the country moves towards Brexit, it will hurt homes, businesses and our public services. I do not want to waste time and energy showing my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But I have a message not for Nottingham Momentum, this is for my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of election or political gains will hinder me in doing what I want to do and is in the interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air goes to the top
Two delayed attempts may have greatly diminished the final result, but Air was undoubtedly worthy of an unprecedented victory in this fantastic tenth match of the day.
Now it is at the top of the table, the only undefeated party in the decade.
It was his excellent defense in the end, as well as taking a better chance by him, which led the home team and coach Peter Murchi had every right to be pleased.
He said, "We have tested this on our field, and today we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy".
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "The credit goes to Ayr, they took their chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, altered by Frazier Climo, put him on the airfront, but a yellow card for Scotland's cap Rory Hughes released by the Warriors for the game allowed Merlows to show the number and Jason Nagote Bagot to capture the irreversible attempt.
Climo added a penalty to Ayer, scoring just before half-time and turning it into a solo attempt to make Ayer 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second attempt well and Patrick Ederson's attempt was overturned by Bagot, who reduced independence to five points.
Then the Ruridyh knot suffered a serious injury, which led to a stretch and then a restart, with a modified effort by Klimmo to push Stafford McDowell Ayer further.
Air acting captain Blair Macpherson was then a yellow-card recipient, with Melrose paying the extra person at the end of a severe pressure with the efforts of an unregistered Bruce Clovin.
Although the home-side came back and when Straw Hutchinson was given a yellow card to meet Clemons without a ball from the penalty line-out, McPherson touched the back of Adeer Mull.
The climate changed, and Carke resumed it with great enthusiasm, with Kelly Rowe sending Flanker Gregor Henry for Homer's fifth attempt after recruiting David Armstrong.
Even now the game seems to be set for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Sports legend Ford Kieran is ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been nominated for the position of Director of a licensed restaurant.
Jack Jarvis, 56, stars in the popular BBC show he is writing and co-starring with long-time comedian colleague Greg Bumpfil.
The two have announced that the show will end with the next new series and it seems that Kieran Craigling is planning for life afterwards.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a Scottish Sun source has indicated that Kieran is keen to join Glasgow's wealthy restaurant business.
"The ocean is ours": landlocked Bolivia hopes the Pacific will reopen its path
The sailor patrols a large number of naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag is flown over public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, sailing destinations are dotted with the slogan: "The sea is officially ours.
It is a duty to recover it".
The memory of a coastal land lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century still burns - as if the Pacific Ocean were to be once again swallowed.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Roberto Callajilla, Bolivian diplomat said, "Bolivia has a spirit of unity and peace, and there is definitely hope for a positive outcome.
Many Bolivians will see the ICG decision on a large screen across the country, hopefully seeing the Tribunal in The Hague side with Bolivia's claim that - after decades of volatile discussions - Chile is bound to negotiate a sovereign exit for Bolivia in the Chilean Sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's miraculously indigenous president - who faces a controversial re-election fight next year - has several rides in Monday's reign.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific, we took oath at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor - and if it does, it will make little difference.
The Netherlands-based UN has no power to cede Chile territory, and it is determined that this will not determine the outcome of any potential talks.
Paz Zret, a Chilean expert in international law, said that the ICJ decision comes six months after the final argument was heard, indicating that the issue was not complicated.
The last four years of removing because of Bolivia would probably set this back.
The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zorro said.
He advised that Morales's aggressive statements have robbed Chile of any remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk about something, but it will be difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court was unusually quick to decide.
Monday will be a unique opportunity for Bolivia to usher in a new era of relations with Chile and for Chile to end 139 years of mutual differences by mutual consent, he said.
Calzadia also denied that Morales - still the most popular of Latin American presidents - used the maritime issue as a political base.
Bolivia has never relinquished its right to access the Pacific Ocean, it has joined them.
The ruling party is trying to see that they need to move beyond the past.
North Korea says that denuclearization will not happen until it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that if he does not trust Washington, his country will not take the initiative in denuclearizing.
Ri was addressing the Joint Assembly on Saturday.
He called on them to implement the promises made at a summit between the two leaders in Singapore.
After Singapore, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is feeling ready to resume more than three months of stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong-un.
Ri says this is a pipe dream that will keep the sanctions and the US opposition going and bring the North to its knees at any moment to stop the Korean War from ending.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang implementing its first major disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country sees as the only option for its own assured security.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Parish fashion shows showcase the latest style of headgear on a grand scale, so the High Street is yours
If you want to add to your collection of hats or completely block the sun, look no further.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of unprecedentedly large headgear for their SS19 collection on the road, which dazzled the styling set at Paris Fashion Week.
High-heeled hats have made Instagram buzz this summer and these designs underneath the catwalk have set the attraction in front of their eyes.
The Stand Out Piece by Valentino was an over-the-top badge hat, decorated by a fan-like long brim, which was bent over the heads of the models.
Other high-pressure items included a strawberry ornament, a fabulous hat, and pineapple - but they weren't designed to keep your head cool.
Thomas Browne also revealed the odd choice of masks - and only for the time of Halloween.
Many coloured masks had sewn over the face and the Haute Couture looked more like a Hannibal Lecter than it did.
One construction was accompanied by a scuba diving gear with snowballs and black glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And you publish a huge fashion statement - you are lucky.
Observers of the style speculate that giant bonnets could make their way onto the big roads.
The outer hat on the high-heeled shoes of the Bombay looks attractive, a two-foot-long brick with a poole hat, which has appeared on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The most prevalent on social media was the cult label behind the unconventional hat, sending a large design under the catwalk - a pool beach bag as large as a model wearing a swimsuit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, cut with raffia fringing and with a white leather handle on top, was a stand-out piece in the Jacquimus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Parish Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I hope big hats and beach bags will hit the high street next summer - because the designer has made such an impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence and have been consistently so in 2018 with a set of outstanding exam results, which are only reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is providing the highest level of service to its students and parents.
The objective of Independent Schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, to prepare them for their chosen career and to maintain their position as global citizens.
As the education sector, which shapes and implements a school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages are unceasingly popular and coveted subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, he understands.
If you speak in a language that touches their heart".
When it comes to building relationships and building trust with people from other countries, this is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone.
In the recent results of this year, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league rankings with the highest passing percentage in independent schools.
68 per cent of students studying foreign language have achieved the highest grade A.
Statistics collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 per cent of students have achieved A grade in Medellin, while 72 per cent are German learners, 69 per cent are French learners and 63 per cent are Spanish learners.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill which will be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are being treated as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects in the curricula of Independent Schools and elsewhere as subject selection.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of reasons given by employers to struggle to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are essential to prepare the majority of young people for their future careers.
With the increased potential for employment opportunities for languages, this skill is essential in a global world.
Choose any career but if they have learned a second language, they will get real benefits from acquiring this kind of life-skills.
Being able to communicate directly abroad will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
A 2013 survey of over 4,000 UK adults found that 75 per cent were unable to communicate adequately in a foreign language, with French being the only language spoken by the double-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
This is why language learning is so important for today's children.
Multi-language children, especially in developing economies, will be equipped with the right opportunities to find meaningful employment.
The special schools in Scotland will be different in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that will be considered the most important for the UK going forward by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, where the teachers are experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are renowned for providing learning opportunities that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future.
In today's global business age, it cannot be denied that it is of utmost importance for the future of the country, which is why it is reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide opportunities of interest, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
This has to happen.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to launch the Lakers on Sunday in St. Diego
The wait for fans to see LeBron James is almost over, with the Los Angeles Lakers making their debut.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But it is still to be decided how many minutes he will play.
It will be more than one and less than 48, Walton said on Lake's official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that it was likely James would play for a limited time.
James was asked about his plans for the Lakers after the six-game preseason schedule earlier this week.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need the Presence Games to prepare", he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally timing, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of campaign rallies in Wayling, West Virginia, starting tonight.
Next week was the first of five scheduled rallies by Trump that included stays in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote to endorse a decision to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, as when the vote is cast in November, there is a risk of losing control by the Republican Congress.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia train live stream on YouTube below.
Trump is expected to address the Supreme Court reclusive Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which has been strained by allegations of sexual misconduct by the anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold a week into the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose behind the rally's excitement is to help the Republicans cope with the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign is aiming for this five-day rally next week to activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand their presence in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Trump's campaign spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, as we are in a busy campaign time.
According to West Virginia Metro News, plans for the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring backers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and coverage from the Pittsburgh media.
It will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia on Saturday, a state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to assist West Virginia Republican Senate Rep. Patrick Morris, who is running behind in the election.
According to Reuters, Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, "This is not a good sign for Morris that he has to try to advance in the presidential election".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows willingness in hopes of keeping Sunday's singles alive
After three one-sided sessions it was down to just four sets of Saturday afternoon, which was probably a necessity for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum in motion is a completely innovative game concept, but one that a player actually believes in and then never happens in competitions like this.
So they're going to say, where's the momentum now?
Because it's been going around all day, Jordan Spieth said, "They had a six-figure boost and now it's four, so we're giving it a little bit of momentum".
Europe has certainly benefited by four points with 12 more points in the game.
As Speith says, Americans feel the air is a little bit in their favor and they have a lot of encouragement, not in the form of Speith and Justin Thomas, who play together all day and each get three out of four points.
Speed was a t-shirt to green and is ahead with an example.
The clash of cheers began to pick up as his round was going on, and while A and Thomas were on the to-do-down to-after, a crucial putt sinking took place to take the match to a four-all-square match.
The pot that won them in the 15th match was met with similar screams, which shows you that the American team is not out of it.
"You really just dug deep and worried about your match", said Spieth.
Every one of those players has left now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players to score more points by Speed and Thomas over the past two days are Fancesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weirdest but adorable couple is four to four and can't make any mistakes.
The only couple who didn't bock on Saturday afternoon was Bollywood, but they did bock on Saturday morning, Friday after nine o'clock.
The run and the way his energy flows both ways into the up-and-down crowd, it seems, is that they are the losers on Sunday, and there will be no more popular players for a potential European win, so sunsets towards Fleetwood or Molinari than Lee Golf National.
Especially the two are together on separate holes.
However, the European pride is ahead of its time.
When he was joined by Alex Noren, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a small job as Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourball.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine, the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole in which he will never come close to climbing.
However, there is no one to help you get out of the hall on Sunday.
It is very interesting to look closely at the Forball and the Forum, because the couples do not take the advice they give because of the interaction between them, and thus the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has done better as a team, so far and in the final days, they have achieved a significant promotion, but the forum session shows that Team USA is willing to fight, which was questioning some particular statistics.
Europe take 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup in four matches after exiting from the Fourball on Saturday and with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo Yomi Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have taken the lead with two wins over Tiger Woods, who are struggling to take four points so far at Le Tiger National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side wants to save the trophy lost in Hazeltas a year ago and take the series 3-1 by dominating the US team in football in the morning.
In the forums, the US gave more resistance, won two matches but they could not work in the loss.
To retain the trophy, Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four in their opening match, after a fantastic weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourball, he performed brilliantly by beating Woods and American player Bryce Deschamble by a more powerful 5&4.
Woods, who had seen himself in two matches on Saturday, showed a powerful burst of intelligence, but now has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and forums.
Justin Rose rested for the morning fours. Dustin Johnson and Brooks returned to teammate Henrik Stenson in a 2-1 loss to Koepka - finishing first and third in the world.
It was not all by itself in Europe on a pleasant sunny day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two digits on Saturday.
He won the foreballs with a 2-1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter and then beat Poulse and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in a return blow, losing two hols early in the foreball.
Only two teams in Ryder Cup history have come back from a four-point deficit to lose in a single, but the Furyk side only need to draw to retain the trophy as holders.
After being in second place for two days, yet returning to strike on Sunday, it seems that this will be beyond that.
North Korea said that it would unilaterally disarm without confidence, "no way".
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions on the United States had deepened his mistrust, and there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Export Council's annual meeting that North Korea had taken "significant good faith measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any response from the US", he said.
Without any confidence in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way that we can disarm ourselves unilaterally first.
When Ri reiterated Washington's objection to North Korean complaints about a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, so that North Korea would gradually make the right decisions as they were rewarded, his statement seemed appropriate, not as a direct rejection of unilateral disarmament as Pyongyang had done in the past.
As Kim vowed to work toward the "decentralization of the Korean Peninsula", Ri issued the first ever joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, and Trump pledged security for North Korea.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US says Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea
The US insisted on "disarmament first" and increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its objective by a deterrent method, even protesting the declaration of an end to the war, Shri said.
The idea that restrictions can bring us to our knees is just a dream of those who ignore us.
But the reality is that continuing sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri made no mention of the plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had mentioned earlier in the week at the UN.
The minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in five months, saying: "The party for this denuclearization problem is South Korea, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come at such a pace".
Even when he told the UN, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from the previous year. General Assembly, which puts the U.S. mainland on target for North Korean rockets, was essential after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as the "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament at the United Nations this year, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-free.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit, "if it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking action.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strict and unfailing enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue until we have complete, final, certified assurance of the destruction of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to bid to raise funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that North Korea had made only hours of progress in denouncing him for "terrorist-like demands".
This month, North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action.'
He said the "appropriate steps" that Kim had told him he wanted were moves to move forward toward security and improving relations with Washington as promised by Trump in Singapore.
Harvard students struggle to find rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University has graduates who go deeper than the growing macho culture being studied by caffeine-fueled "all-nighters".
When it came to how to take care of themselves, the children of the world's top universities saw an academic with no backing.
Charles Kazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Bread and Women's Hospital, designed the curriculum, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
She was inspired to start this course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of it, a girl came to me and said, "Now, in my senior year, why am I the only one being told this?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first implemented this year, teaches students how good sleep habits help in academics and athletic performance and enhance their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and acting director of the university's health services, said the university decided to launch the course after finding students sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One section is a photo of a room in the students' residence, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and lighting and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep time.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Map the complex with an interactive icon, then encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke for smoking, Professor Kazisler added.
He said that the culture of 'all-nighter pulling' pride still exists, he said that the increasing pressure on modern technologies and students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough good quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety - even to lose weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode that causes them to feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, took one of his classes during his first year at Harvard and helped Professor Kazisler design the course.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired him for campus-wide course.
Next, they expect that all these postgraduate students will be asked to complete the same study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Kazisler recommended that students should know about the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting systems, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm from the kilter to lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Manga Goal is beating off Gerald's men
The Rangers faced a second battle of the far blues as the Strikers were dissatisfied with the striker Dolly Mangan's 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's Livingston.
Ebrooks wanted to enter their first win on the road since a 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team left Gerard's second defeat as manager of 18 games in his favour.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers were not even motivated to balance.
Rangers finished sixth, while Livingston moved up to third and just behind Hibernian by a goal.
Apparently throwing an object from a distance could cause further trouble for Rangers in the store after Linesman Banana Spence was moved under treatment for a head injury.
Gerard made eight changes to the side, which in the past had earned Yare a place in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with that Levi 11, who took a point from Hurts last week and is delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit has taken the breath away of his opponents at every stage.
The Rangers may have dominated but Livingston did a lot with the ball he had.
He needed only two minutes to give up when Mangala's first-time late-off Scott Pittman sent him through the goal but the midfielder seized his big opportunity.
A deep cage Jacob got to captain Craig Hulkett after a free-kick but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only extend to the back post.
Rangers were in control but in the final third looked more hopeful than he was convinced about the game.
Alfredo Morelos definitely felt he should have been penalised at the fifteenth minute as he and Steven Lores clashed but referee Steven Thomason rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers used only two first half shots on target, but former Ebrooks goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely bothered by Lhasa Coulibaly's header and a weakened Ave Azria strike.
While Levine's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of the game, no one can deny that he deserved it for his own good.
Again, the Rangers failed to work with the Deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Airfield did not respond as Deacon Gallagher hit the ball over Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick up the manga for a smooth ending.
Gerard returned to work on the break as he swapped Coolidge for Ryan Kent and the winger's slot in the switch morlocks provided almost immediate effect but the impressive Kelly was blocked from his line.
But Livingstone continued to play to his delight, keeping the visitors in line by hitting the long ball high with a leather and helmet.
Holt's side extended their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to block Jacob before Lithgow came from the corner.
Glen Middleton was replaced by a penalty on the Rangers as he messed with Jacobs but again saw Thomas out of the way.
Panchang: inventor of the gigger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and COUNTING... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the science has become a mainstay, as well as a mainstay of the Giger counter pop culture, starring the seemingly unlikely Gyphoc scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950 film Bells of Cornado.
Man: What is that world?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear earphones, you can actually hear the effects given by the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: "Say, it's definitely popping up!"
Hans Giger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'see' bad cells
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells.
The method involves extracting the patient's immune cells, turning them into a lab.
Then they can 'see' the normal protein for many cancers and then re-injected
A trial vaccine has shown promising results in many cancer patients.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells found that her uterine cancer was cured in 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, turning them into a laboratory so that they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinserting the cells.
Professor J. Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "increases the development of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers", explained Prof. Bernzowski.
His approach of teaching how to extract immune cells from patients and how to target cancer cells has worked in a type of leukemia treatment.
After her SNL appearance, Ny West hit on the pro-Trump Dietrib wearing a mega hat.
It didn't get better.
Kanye West's Hurricanes were called into the studio after a thrilling performance praising his U.S. during Saturday Night Live, and President Donald Trump said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great Hat, he continued to fight the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often talk to an American and they say: "How do you like Trump, is he racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
SNL kicked off the show with Skitt, starring Matt Damon, mocking Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual harassment made by Hollywood star Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's rent was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the posting.
Also, West complained to the audience that she had an unpleasant time wearing her headgear.
They threatened me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They Harassed Me!
According to the Washington Examiner he said, and then they say I'm in a sunken place".
West walked over: "Do you want to see the sinking?" He would wear my Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love".
Her comments received at least twice the hoyout from listeners and disappointed SLN members, Variety reported, with one person telling the publication there: "There was intense snorting throughout the studio".
Weston was taken in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his performance of the song I'll Live It, dressed as a performer.
West was endorsed by TPUSA Group head Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up in the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply "who she is and she is absolutely amazing".
But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing an ideology and speaking out against my community.
It is independent.
So are we", she added.
Before the show, stating that he is now known as Kanye West, the rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and was definitely changed by the music legend Prince to a symbol and then to an artist already known as Prince.
Attempted murder by beating in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after killing a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said that the incident took place in Balihmakamur.
He is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kate Harrington is shot at by a toxic maniac.
Kit Harrington is famous for his swordplay role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has struck at the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such roles on screen mean that young people feel they must be strong to earn respect.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit states that he believes 'something has gone wrong' and raises the question of how to tackle the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that she feels too strongly about addressing the issue.
I feel at this moment personally, very strongly - where have we done anything wrong with masculinity?'
What are we teaching them about the problem we see as men as they grow up?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is the birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that young boys feel this should be a specific part of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because something has clearly gone wrong with the young men.'
He admitted in an interview that he is tired of the battlefields and horses, and that he will not be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when it comes to the end of next summer.
November Kit will star in the lead role in Sam Shepard's comeback True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he is considering meeting his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life here.'
Rose played Yegret in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Kit's character Jon Snow's love affair.
The couple married in June 2018 at the location of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China records 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted by sex, reflecting a shift from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in large parts of China as a result of infectious blood transmission.
Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province that the number of people living with HIV has now been reduced to almost zero.
Year-on-year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discouraged in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rampant.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases are spread due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised the synergistic use of HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee had leaked GOP senator data, blasts, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. McKison Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on members' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insists that the claims were driven by "ultra-right-wing" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, and more hateful lies, voters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information transmitted included home addresses and phone numbers for the U.S. Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, appeared online on Thursday.
The leaks came after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pandit and RedStat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the office of the voters and published information of a member of the voter staff, Hill said.
These baseless allegations are a complete lie and a complete lie, Waters continued.
My staff member - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
These baseless allegations are completely false and a complete lie.
Voters' statement immediately drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Erie Fleisher.
"This rejection is in anger", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she is unlikely to become a member of Congress.
They bear with patience when others accuse them.
They should not be defamed.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and unblemished".
Fleischer was comparing voters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Jhoter Kavanaugh, who was accused by angry critics during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Nawar also expressed his thoughts on Twitter to unite voters in the midterm elections.
"Big if the truth is", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office "has warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims".
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, and "they will be legally accountable for all their actions that are disastrous and dangerous to me and any members of staff".
John's English Strikes Again review downplayed the Rowan Atkinson spy spoof.
It is now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new film with a British slant and that applies to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Should we be self-parodied on the fact that we are the new opportunities of the country?
At any rate, the rather subdued, rubber-faced Johny English has a license to remake anything for the second time - though his codename is more than anything that it is a widespread comic creation designed for a non-English - cinematic realm.
He is definitely a skilled secret agent who despite his bizarre disguise, Mr. Bean's costume and a doll of that boy have gotten a bit of a clue in the riots of the fire-themed tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is based on the traveller and mystery international man Atkinson who once played Chaos in a Barclays TV commercial following him.
This latest JEE outing has a nice moment or two.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter, while he was wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor blade had been wrapped around his helmet for some time.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the comedy feels very little and strangely half-baked, especially with serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible providing comedy as their confident component.
It seems that the comic is made for young children rather than adults, and for me the useless adventures of John English are not as exploratory and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
Now the best local evidence is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's spy super-secret web network, exposing the identities of agents across the UK, to the collapse of the agent on duty - a pitifully minor role for Kevin Alden.
This is the final straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and embracing figure who is already grappling with political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this QC-Theresa-Me character but there is nothing special in the script to work with her.
Her secret advisors advised her that as every active spy compromised she would have to bring someone out of retirement.
This means fighting off John English himself, who is now working as a schoolmaster in a posh establishment, but how the off-the-record evidence of being an undercover operative is giving: Here are some good gags, as the English spy rock-type academy presents.
English is sent back to Whitefall for an urgent briefing and reunited with his long-suffering ex-buff, played again by Ben Miller.
Buff is a married man, commanded by a submarine commander, playing a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicky Pepiddin is a bit of a loser.
So Batman and Robin are back in action getting things very wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Olga Kurialenko's beautiful Femi Fate Ofelia Bulatova fighting off the other.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister is falling prey to the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the wicked Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bogue begin their odyssey of farcical high jinks, disguised as a servant, they set fire to a flash game restaurant; they board Volta's luxury boat and smuggle; and English triggers pure chaos as he tries a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the obstacles have been removed for that final sequence, but as it is adequate and entertaining, there is very little children's TV about the whole thing.
Beautiful medium stuff.
And I can't help but think, as happens with other John English films: could the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour rejects, it plans for Britons to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan in which Britons will work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to get employees through the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution so that they can be given more days.
He'll see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking home the same pay.
The sources said that this idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has endorsed the four-day week to take advantage of the changing economy for workers.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be released before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but the four-day working week is an ambition that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Green Party will not be the first party to endorse the idea of a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this wish is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four-day working week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to dispel his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to get power back from the 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' in utility companies.
Shareholders in water companies will not be able to recover their full stake as the Labour government may 'cut' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also backed plans to create inclusive ownership funds to put employees on company boards and hold employees 10 per cent of the equity of private sector companies, which stand to be pocketed with annual dividends of up to £500.
Linda Graham, John Kennedy speaks 60 minutes on whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the nomination in the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the bureau's findings raise questions about whether any Republican senators can be pressured to support it.
In an interview Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, could the FBI find anything that would motivate him to change his mind?
Kennedy seemed more liberal than his ally from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean that, of course".
I said, I went to the hearing and said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this incident, I called him, the charge was dropped, and he said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, determined and unparalleled.
Graham's vote, however, appears to be in stone.
My mind is about Brett Kwanang and he will charge dynamite, he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it outright, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And they could not bear to answer her, because she was a woman of great faith.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizens Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive line-up of artists and an equally impressive goal; end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will bring thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the feats of Majone Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the ceremony's goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive free tickets to the concert (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the musicians had to complete a series of tasks, or tasks, such as e-mailing, calling a world leader, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal in 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free music program a realistic way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - people believing they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, emphasizing a variety of goals.
These actions have inspired world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in pledges and policies to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, he says.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that safe funds have directly impacted approximately 649 million people worldwide to date.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers, is among some of the most significant commitments to "help children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million in aid to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With your support from the UK government, as well as from donors, national governments and global citizens, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", said Tracy Ulman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, to the gathering at a live music concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children across the UK, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children suffering from malnutrition.
In response to a FAQ on his website, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racist movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the acts featured in this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Russian may use U.S. Navy for blockade to disrupt energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could use its navy if necessary to prevent collisions on Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke accused Russia's involvement in Syria - significantly, where it is running at the invitation of the Vaidya government - of being a pretense to explore new energy markets.
I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want the power of the broker as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States has our naval capability, and the sea route is open to blockade if necessary, to ensure that its energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that has established itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and noted that they were almost identical.
He called Russia a "swimming on a potato" economy that relies heavily on sea oil, saying that "the economic option on Iran and Russia is to take advantage, at least to a certain extent, and the fuel option.
These statements come as the Trump administration is working to increase exports of its cheap liquefied natural gas (LNG) to European customers instead of Russia.
To fulfill that goal, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, tried to get Germany out of the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a full-scale economic project.
Russia argues that the US's strong opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we are of the opinion that energy can never be a tool for the use of force and that consumers have the right to choose their suppliers".
Germany has not backed down from the US stance and has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading association for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to withdraw from the European Energy Policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) Dieter Kemf said that he was very concerned that a third country was interfering with our energy supply.
Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren will take a "tough stance" in running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warne said Saturday that she will take a "tough stance" in running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts that he would host the Running for President.
According to The Hill newspaper, it is time for women to invade Washington and fix our broken government, with women at the top.
After November 6, I will take a hard line in running for president.
Warren rained on President Donald Trump during the town hall and said that he was "taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am ashamed of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been outspoken in their criticism of the war.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We had to have an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday found that a majority of Warren's candidates do not think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not take the step.
Thirty-two percent supported the move.
The poll found Runn's support was 38 percent in favour and 48 percent against, with former Governor Deval Patrick being the strongest backer.
Other high-profile Democratic names in the discussion in the context of a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin has cited PTSD from track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in the military in Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in a domestic violence case.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sarah told the audience about Donald, "The situation my own son is going through, what is going on with him after he returns, I can understand the pain of the families of soldiers suffering the consequences of PTSD and some of those who returned wounded".
Paulin described his arrest as proving the "elephant in the room", saying of his son and other veterans returning from war, "The returnees have changed, they return as tough, they see what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military is giving back to the country in return for what they gave".
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday for domestic violence charges of assaulting a woman from Wasilla, Alaska, and for interfering in a domestic violence case and possessing a weapon while intoxicated.
DCSs from 18 States have endorsed the challenge against the new Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which denies asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-court settlement in Washington on Friday in support of shelter buffaloes challenging the policy.
The prosecutor's full name is Grace V. The Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She was harassed by her partner and her violent gang member sons, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys from states supporting Grace wrote to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, prompting a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum as the country grapples with widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. Asylum Police overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum from domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of old state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances, and that such legislation violates that principle, the findings of court concluded.
The attorneys further argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry shocked the U.S. economy, which was working to become entrepreneurial and provide "an essential labor supply".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to provide shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11, saying that asylum is available for people who leave their homelands because of fear of belonging to a particular social group or political opinion, race, religion, nationality, or other reasons.
Asylum was not meant to eliminate all the problems, all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescue efforts to find survivors have been stepped up as the death toll in Palo has doubled.
The situation was even more dire for those who survived.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was comforting her fever-stricken child at the evacuation centre in Palo City, said, "There is a lot of tension.
Every minute an ambulance brings a dead body.
There is a lack of clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up waterlogged belongings and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds injured and 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Adura, hospitals were in shock.
Dwy Harris, one of several wounded, had a broken back and shoulder and was resting outside the Army Hospital in Palo, as patients were treated there due to frequent strong aftershocks.
He remembered with tears those moments in the fifth floor of the hotel room, which was shaken by the earthquake, with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to defend ourselves.
Harris, who was in town for a family wedding, told the Associated Press, "I felt like I was crushed under the rubble of the hotel.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was no sound.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my baby.
I hope they will be safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' with 'propaganda aids'
A four-page advertisement in the official Chinese newspaper in the US cited the mutual benefits of US-China trade, a week after the announcement the US ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the addition of a Des Moines Register ad by Lowa state's best-selling newspaper China Daily - accusing it of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, which China rejected.
Trump's allegation that China tried to interfere in U.S. elections has ushered in a new phase of accelerating the U.S. campaign to increase pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
It is common for foreign governments to resort to advertising to promote trade, but China and the US have recently intensified the trade war, and both have imposed new tariffs on each other's imports.
At the start of the trade war, China's reactionary tariffs were designed to target exporters in states like Lowa, and Lowa supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstead, the longtime governor of China's main agricultural exporter, said China has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstedt wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now double-crossing us with propaganda ads in our own free press".
Branstead wrote that "to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's glorious tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of expression by printing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register".
"Conversely, in the Chinese newspaper world you will hear limited anti-suggestion and you will not see a true reflection of the disagreement of the Chinese people on China's worried economic flow, because the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that a leading Chinese newspaper had turned down an offer to publish his article, though he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republican midterm elections are offending women voters by defending Kavanagh
While standing with and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warned that the party will face resentment in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment around the issue has been overwhelming, and most Republicans are already saying they want to move forward with a referendum.
Grant Rehner, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in an article published in The Hill on Saturday that there is no going back on those issues.
I don't think last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on the FBI investigation will appeal to angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow and they won't forget in November", Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MovOne, told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
"November is coming!" protested protesters in the Senate hallway on Friday morning, saying that the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee had pushed forward Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford!
Nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "The Democrats' enthusiasm and inspiration is at an all-time high.
People say that enthusiasm is already there; and it is true.
But it can be a bigger swing especially among women voters in small towns and young voters aged 18-29 who don't vote often when they don't like the president".
Before Ford's public testimony detailed the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could come if Republicans move forward with confirmation.
According to Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, NBC News, "This has become a convoluted puzzle for the GOP.
It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's about the way the Republicans have handled the whole issue and the way they've handled the plaintiff, Guy Cecil, director of the group Priorities USA, which elects Democrats, told the news channel.
However, going further in the wake of the Ford-Kawanuga agreement could somewhat divide the American people.
A new poll from the National Center for Justice found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely were with Kavanagh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanagh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reports that after pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted him while he was 17 years old.
Ramirez has alleged that the Supreme Court nominee had exposed her at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web for Google and Facebook is planning to launch a new Internet
The team of inventors of the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of Technology Legend, Inrupt is a company that is building a solid Berners-Lee open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information to allow access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind the Intercept is "world domination".
We have to do it now, he said about startups.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include a contact list, to-do list, calendar, music library, and other personal and business tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify and is available on the same browser and everywhere at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which type of information to give access to.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the company with the resources, process and the right expertise to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company has contracted some staff developers and volunteer coders from IBM-acquired security platform Bruce to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes to "where all their business models stand out overnight".
We don't need their permission for that.
In a post published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "goal is to provide the professional energy and ecosystem to help secure the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
Burns-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994, when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic for the next era of this web, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric
The only church in England to have a cleric who won the Victoria Cross in World War I and has celebrated his 100th year in the city.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award on 29 September 1918 in the raids on Belengalese and Lehcourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and nobody knew after that that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wan, said it was a "brilliant symbol", that the monument would mark his grandfather's award-winning feat for almost 100 years.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wayne led his battalion towards the Canal de Saint-Quentin amid "extreme fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later reached the firing line and advanced with "heavy gallantry" running alone with a field-gun and emerging in three squadrons.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wan, 72, said that what his grandfather did "was something I knew I could never do but it made me feel somewhat humbled".
He and his brother Dr. James Wan also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wan said he "feels very honoured to take part in the parade" and added that "the support given by many is showing the bravery of a real hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Papa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch Pac-Baller 206 to refuse to watch the main event.
The San Jose bill includes 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, the audience in the UK was appalled when Gagard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other and the coverage changed to Peppa Pig instead.
Some stayed up until early in the morning for a special fight until they knew it was going to happen.
A fan on Twitter called the children's cartoon a "sick joke".
Asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, said "the government rule was that the content was not appropriate for 6pm so they had to go to children's programming.
Papa the Pig, "Yes".
Scott Cocker, Chairman of the Bellator Company, said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably do it", Cocker said.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning and we could not do this work in the same way as we do on Sunday and on Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the switch over is there, a lot of text goes back and forth and it didn't seem to be smooth.
We tried to fix it and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise you that this will not happen again.
We'll keep it five fights instead of six as we normally do and we tried to deliver more for the fans and we went from the top.
It's called a bad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly has experienced 'anonymous' over sex
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
Daly, 24, said that it wasn't until he went to high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on First Radio 4's Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about "giving people hope" about gay rights.
He also said that being a parent makes it less of a focus on winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, has been ill for several months.
Appearing as a cast member on Laverne's first program, Daly said she felt "more lacking than anyone else" in her because "it's not socially acceptable to pick boys and girls".
He said: "To date, those who have felt inferior and those who have felt different have actually given me the strength and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", so he didn't disappoint anyone when he found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to abolish homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he considers himself lucky to have gotten to live without solutions and he wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said she fell in love with U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she "suddenly caught on to" in a 2013 interview.
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
When you go through so many good-hitting occasions at such a young age - he competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later. He said it's hard to find a humble person who has had similar good-hitting experiences.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said it changed "the whole perspective" of their lives.
If you had asked me last year, 'I want to win a gold medal' was everything.
You know what is bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son's name is similar to that of his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011.
Daly said his father had not accepted dying and finally said that if he still had tickets for London 2012 - he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him that you can't sit in a dressed line, Dad, he said.
His breathing slowed down and he stopped breathing until I sat holding his hand. Dad died and I finally accepted that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I realized that this was my lifelong dream - there was no special feeling in diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games.
He also deliberately chose the Pride song from his previous song Heather Small, a song that came to be used to tie the knot at the Olympics and still thrills him.
Desert Island is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Out of Form for Michaelson sat on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil McLelson will set a record by playing the 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unhappy milestone.
Michaelson is going to play in the biennial event for a record 12th time, he was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, it's done repeatedly for the United States, rather than being in the middle of the main action five times as he has done repeatedly for the United States, this five-time champion has divided his day between being among them as a cheerleader and focusing on his game and working towards what can be improved in his game.
Even at the peak of his career without quite straight drivers the 48-year-old is not ideally suited for the tight Le Golf National course, where long rough terrains regularly punish for false shots.
And if the course itself isn't as tough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has paired with Toki Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans lose by four points in 12 singles matches, Michaelson's match could prove decisive as the competition is over before it starts.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, he had nothing else to say.
"He has understood his role today, he patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he is ready for tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has given a lot of life to this team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine that he would play two matches.
I had more to imagine, but we thought we had to go as far as we could.
He wants to live there like everyone else".
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record with Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
That may make the end of a Ryder Cup career memorable that never matched the heights of his personal record.
Despite 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries at Michaels, Furyk said his presence has communicated some unseen power to the team.
He is funny, he is sarcastic, he is humorous, he likes to make fun of people and he is a noble person to be in the team room, he explained.
I think the youngest players can have fun with him, it was a pleasure to see him this week.
He has a lot more to offer than just playing".
Europe's captain Thomas Bajorne knows the big lead will be broken at any moment
European captain Thomas Bajorne knows from experience that a massive lead up to the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an upset.
Dane started his career in 1997 with a match at Valledrama, in which side captain Seve Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans, but narrowly escaped the final by 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
You remind yourselves that we had a big lead in Veldearama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Veldearama we won, only then, Bijorn said, after watching the class of 2018 win both 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and all of our team that time has not passed.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It is not finished until the points are on the board.
Our goal and our aim is to try and win this trophy and that is where the focus is.
I have told everyone that I am focused on the 12 players on our side, but we also know that there are great players in the world on the other side.
Bjorn adds that it is thrilling to see the way his players have performed on the tough golf course: "I never put myself ahead of this.
Tomorrow is a different creature.
Tomorrow will be a personal exhibition and it is a different thing to do.
When everything is going well, it is great with the partner, but when you have to show performance in person, your ability as a golfer is put to the test.
The only message you need to get to the players is that you have to give your best performance tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and give him your best and your best".
Unlike Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk would expect a better performance individually than his partner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four, minus him from the rest of the players.
Furyk himself has tasted both defeat and victory, Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medina" and was part of Brooklyn's winning team before emerging as the loser.
When asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had carried his players on the last day of the 1999 season, he said, "I remember every word of it".
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have to start off fast like you saw in Medina, like you saw in Brooklyn.
When momentum is moving in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in the midfield matches.
Let's set up our line-up accordingly and put the players in a design that we feel we can show some magic tomorrow".
Thomson is tasked with leading the game and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter facing other Europeans in the top half order.
Bjorn of the Singles Selection said, "I went into this group in this order because I think it covers everything".
The new German battleship is moored again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to replace the Cold War-era warships in 2014, but due to the defective systems and the high cost, the Comsecum could not be delivered until next year, local media said.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, a military spokesperson said that the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates of the "Rhineland-Palatinate" brand has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel was to join the Navy in 2014, but controversial post-delivery issues have stalled the future of the ambitious project.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels in 2007 to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will have features such as a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and several stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include its long maintenance period - it should be able to deploy new frigates from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays mean that cutting-edge warships are said to be able to showcase Germany's power abroad but will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The weakened F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to officially sanction the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy has sent a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was said about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media cited several significant "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship sent on a combat mission useless.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class battleships would be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors, this manpower being only half that on the older Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is thought to be as heavy as the Age class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project including crew training is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the initial cost of the project has increased from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problem of new frigates has become particularly significant in light of recent warnings of a declining German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was actually "going through a shortage of deployment-capable vessels".
The issue was heating up over time, as the old ships were scrapped, but no vessels were given, the official said.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Evisdrops on the Secret Life of Bees
New research being carried out on real estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to understand how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will include common and soprano pipestrels as well as brown long-eared and dowbenton bats in the Inverway Gardens at West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bats activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' sound and what species are doing.
Then a habitat map and report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Daver, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to better determine the benefits such as grassland creation and how to best conserve woodlands for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development works that damage their routes and habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, flypapers and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced eco-location technique to identify errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks of the country and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Chamachidia very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect resting places and occasionally conduct rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve area at the Threeway estate in Drumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is an ideal area for him.
We have developed a nice area for bats here at Thrive, he said.
We found old buildings, lots of old trees and very good habitats.
But there's still a lot about that bat that's still unknown, so what we're working on here and other properties will help us understand more about how to move forward".
He stressed the importance of screening bats before undertaking maintenance on the property as the potential unintended destruction of a single breeding litter could lead to the extinction of 400 females and juvenile bats, possibly the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, maim or harass them or destroy their roasts.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged people to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and their many species, we don't even know how their populations are growing".
Ronaldo denied the rape claim, with prosecutors suing the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape claims against him "fake news", saying Ronaldo wants people to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, the magazine alleged.
In 2009, Portugal and Juventus forward Ronaldo is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room.
He is alleged to have been paid $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the claim was reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo, addressing Ronaldo's 14.2 million fans in an Instagram live video, called the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
Everything they printed today is fake news", five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo told the camera.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
And that is normal.
They want to be famous by printing my name, but this is part of the business.
I'm happy and all is well", Ronaldo said with a smile.
Reuters news agency reported that Munjab's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, a report they have called "inappropriate reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schartez said the player will recover damages for damage to the moral image commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is possibly the most serious violation of individual rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by committing an act against nature, according to papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and only "one percent" inferior.
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and that she even took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared retaliation" and "worried about being publicly humiliated".
Mayorka, 34, says she now wants to rescind the settlement because she is constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged abuse, Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and had moved to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing its status as carmaker
If the UK loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, it will 'always regret it,' Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "important" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnton, near Derby, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of the no-deal Brexit event could take jobs.
Toyota's Oris and Avansson-building Burnstone plant produced around 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory stop", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota at Barnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about the fear of leaving the EU, saying how cross-border business including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover would work if they left the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
In the case of a no-deal Brexit, car manufacturers say that supply chain risk is a major concern.
Toyota's production lines are run on a "just-in-time" basis for car orders coming from both the UK and the European Union and parts arrive from suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border and, according to industry, it could lead to parts shortages and delays.
The company stated that it is not possible to keep more than a day's worth of Toyota inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production will be discontinued.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Checks Plan for future relations with the EU was "specifically designed to avoid checks at the border".
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "We need a deal. We want to make the best deal, to seize this opportunity with success in the present.
Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers' evidence says that we need to be fully capable to continue the highly successful supply chain.
It is not possible to say how long Toyota will be shut down but with a prolonged shutdown, he warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Sovellaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is a United Union conveyor at the plant, said that the concerns of its members are growing: "My experience is that once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
The government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a concrete and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "will be postponed for another week" as the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues to be debated, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump supporters and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumours of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and whether Mueller's freedom will be threatened by it, have been running through the streets of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein wore wires to record conversations with Trump and discussed the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reportedly, to resign.
Instead of a meeting with Trump, it was announced on Thursday who would be at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't like" firing Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which had to take the testimony of both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, with further delays in the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date has not been set, it could be this week, I think everything is taken care of with the Supreme Court and it will be postponed for another week.
However, we will see and I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists objected that Sanders had not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Anchor Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders said the reason for not doing the briefings was not to "irritate" TV reporters, adding that "I don't disagree with the fact that they are upset".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
She said the current president has had more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president. She added without providing evidence: "We know the numbers".
Sanders said the briefing would still take place, but "if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it's many times better than talking to me".
We are trying to do that and we have done a lot in the last few weeks and you can talk to the President of the United States when the press briefing is held.'
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or a press conference with visitors.
However, a single press conference is rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have said why the reporters assumed strange situations and behaved recklessly before they gathered.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff to express the country's gratitude to the staff working in the NHS in Scotland and wishes they would stay post-Brexit.
The Freeman MSP of GA sent the letter less than six months after the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the costs of implementing the Standing Status for EU citizens employed in its dedicated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving were ongoing and were moving towards an expected decision by this autumn.
But the UK government is also moving ahead in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this is a very uncomfortable time for all of us.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I attach great importance to the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators from across the EU have contributed their valuable experience and expertise to strengthen healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Kristen Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after severe head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Kristen Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a serious head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to a report by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
He slipped aside and fell down there, Reed said.
Trainees and medical staff gave him Abercrombie oxygen before putting him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type or extent of injury have been identified yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Redshirt sophomore Abercrombie Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, adding to his season total of 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay high stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay high stamp duty to buy property in the UK to help the homeless with extra cash under the new Tory plan using extra cash.
This move will negate the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters.
Stamp duty will be increased on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects it will be able to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless in this way
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty with extra cash used to help the homeless when buying property in the UK, which Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to target younger voters with more affordable housing and higher-income earners.
To boost the government's campaign to combat rough sleeps, an increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and companies in the UK.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which may include the high level introduced on the purchase and sale of a second home two years ago and may be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this to raise up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" as there are large numbers of foreign buyers and they spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes at a time when Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of raising land prices by occupying it, and Theresa May urged the UK to release quotas on cheap housing to fix its "housing dysgrace".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a spectacular series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and "no-fault" occupancy vacating.
He wants to give more power to the committee to build new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means we fix the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is not at all appropriate that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK and working in overseas-based companies as it is for a hard-working UK resident to buy a house.
For many, the dream of buying a house has become a rarity and sleeping in a dishonorable rented house is becoming a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My last wish to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate wish" is to be Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is taking on the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, with the top three points.
He disappeared from the stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back into last season's Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always holds me back.
That opportunity will only come if I succeed in club management".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager have included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo DiCanio.
The former Aloha Athletic boss says he does not find it troublesome to follow such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'If I can get this club back into the Premier League, can I succeed at this moment?
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly has a place in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get it, but if I can take the club back there, I will see myself successful here.
Ross has been in his management career for just three years, at Dumbarton he has worked 15 months as an assistant boss and on the coaching staff of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa back to three-tier status, and led St Mirren to the championship title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
And he said, Perhaps it was a life-threatening thing.
I really believed that management was better suited for me than playing.
It seems strange because I've made it right, lived a decent life out of it and enjoyed some decent goals.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to see on a weekly basis.
I still go through the pressure and burden of that work but the management seems quite right.
I always wanted to run and now that I do, it feels most comfortable for me in my entire life".

The best time for a pint is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday, the survey found.
The summer heatwave has boosted earnings for Britain's struggling pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurants saw a 4.8 percent decline in revenue.
Peter Martin, of Business Consulting CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The pattern of the previous month of June in July was continued due to the heat of the constant sun and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup, with pubs up 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were hit harder.
The situation worsened in July after a decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant sales in June.
The drinks-based pubs and bars did excellent business as the restaurants went down in sales.
Food-based pubs have also suffered heat losses, though not as heavy as restaurant operators.
It meant that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drink sales in the pubs and bars operated increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent.
Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM Paul Neumann said: "We have been seeing these results trend steadily since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to outdoor market sales.
It is not surprising that despite the ongoing struggle of restaurant groups, the ongoing decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will have a worse impact, especially on the ongoing price pressures.
The long hot summer should not be a bad time for the food industry and time will tell how much relief we are now experiencing from the moderate temperatures in August".
Total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 per cent in July, showing a slow decline in brand roll-outs.
The Coffee Peach Tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector monitors the sales of the industry and obtains and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of 9 billion British pounds and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have a private social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, the survey found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a "fake Instagram" page
There is a growing fear in the news that it is being posted about sex.
20 percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have a private social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapidly growing "fake Instagram" page - a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
There is a growing fear in the news that it is being posted with sex content.
20 per cent of students said they have a "main" account to show to parents while they also have a second private account.
A mother saw her 13-year-old daughter's mysterious site exploding, with the teenager begging others to "rape" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters "and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 per cent of people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of those holding a private account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "Many teens are distracted by finding places online where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eliud Doyle will be "the voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Elidhe Doyle has been elected as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body of the Board of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian B.T. described the move as a great opportunity for mentoring seekers to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the last decade.
Elidhe is widely respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from him by bringing him on board.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to working as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute to Scotland and guide the sport".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover or how much.
After a lot of hard work, she made a full recovery, learned how to walk and is now practicing hallucinations!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Online opinion differs in the advertising of breast pumps compared to mothers' cows
The breast pump company has shared an online opinion with the advertisement and it compares cow milk care to mothers.
To launch the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company LV released a tang-in-chic music video-inspired advertisement, expressing the mother's freedom to show off the new pump.
Four real mothers dance on a track in a village strewn with cows and sing songs: "Yes I give milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "Yes, you may not see a fist, it's my breast".
The chorus goes on: "Pump it, pump it, I'm feeding its children, pump it, pump it, I'm sucking my women's milk".
However, the announcement on the firm's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
It is a very wrong decision to use cows to advertise this product.
She conceives, she beareth, she sucketh, and she is weaned; and the days of her child are taken away from her.

Another commented: "It's very traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why don't mothers who have their babies use breast pump advertising?"
Another added: "This is an out of touch advertisement".
Defending the second ad, one woman admits that she found the song "hilarious".
I think this is a genius idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would need it.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
It's a bit of a crazy ad but it looks like it is to me.
This is a genius product", AK wrote.
Another commented: "This is an entertaining ad aimed at those who pump (often in their workplace or toilets) and who are cow-like moms.
This is not a praise or evaluation of the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women explain that they were all dancing with a smart pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump breasts say they look like cows.
However, the Elvy pump, which is quite silent, has no wires or tubes and fits perfectly inside a nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and even go outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Anna Banarin commented: "The Elvy Pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and aggressive launch.
By drawing parallels between expressing women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and all its challenges into the light, and demonstrate in a fun and vivid way that this new pump brings a wonderful sense of liberation.
This is not the first time that Elvy Pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two used the product to catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although the number of immigrant children detained has increased, the proportion of monthly border crossings has not changed, as the tough cuts and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and they fear their ability to stay in the country by going ahead and claiming those children.
In June, federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration officials, a risk that increased with the announcement.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confessed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor numerous citizens.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Up to 80 per cent of the sponsors or household members reside in the country illegally, and most of them have criminal connections.
So we continue to press those individuals' footsteps", Albans said.
To process the children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, which shelter workers previously said was 60 days.
Many immigration judges will be met by video conference call, rather than in person, to request their case for legal status.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief will be expeditiously disposed of.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can result in violent clashes or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports emerging from the system in recent months.
The lawyers said that concerns have been raised at a large facility like Tornillo, where the number of children is more likely to be neglected.
He added that moving to a tent city without giving children enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could shock many who are already struggling.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish to withdraw 'occupation forces' immediately
While the country has been in a war for eight years, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ul, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called for the return of Syrian refugees.
Maullem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said that under the guise of fighting terrorism, foreign forces were illegally occupying Syrian soil and "it will be fairly dealt with".
He must go back immediately and without any conditions, he told the assembly.
Maullem stressed that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this clash until we clear all areas of Syria for both terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence.
The UN has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing both training and advice to Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Maule said that conditions were good for them to return, and he accused some Western countries of spreading "irrational fear" that forced refugees to stay away.
We have called upon the international community and humanitarian agencies to facilitate the return of these people, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely human problem.
The United Nations and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be given to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in one of the last strongholds of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal halted a major potential attack by Russia-allied forces on a province of Syria, home to three million people.
However, Maullem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra fighters who would be annihilated.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of government and opposition members, soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Maullem drafted the conditions for participating in the Syrian government committee, which said that the row's work should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Another Session
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless the slander and scandal ends your presidency prematurely, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
There is no doubt that it will be a dramatic presidential final like never before!"
So far, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, President-Time's ratings have more than doubled from 1.05 million on CNN and tripled from about 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, prime-time viewership of Fox News averages 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Meadow Show leads cable ratings with nearly 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neil Baer, who runs ABC's "Designated Drama" show about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the devastating attack on the Legislative Building.
Neil Scovell, a veteran humorist and author of Just the Funny Parts: And Hollywood Boys is another theory of some hard truths about sneaking into clubs.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, 'Because they make me laugh,' Ms. Scovell told me.
The crowd has entertainment value.
After all, unlike anything on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the fate of Row V. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Being tuned is a luxury that only privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, go beyond being an informed citizen when you see yourself at six o'clock discussing the effects of a row of experts on the source of the deep background for Bob Woodward's book Fier, Paul Manafort's $15,000 shah-mermaid-skin bomber jacket (a thick cloth with a Hebreeus, the Washington Post calls it), and Mr. Trump's, um, silly description of the anatomy of Stormy Daniels.
I will, for one, never look at Super Mario the same again.
Everything he does as part of a reality show feels like he's feeding something every night, Brent Montgomery, president executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pun Stars, said of the Trump show's changing cast and the daily twisting narrative (fighting with Kim Jong-un, praising him).
You can't afford to miss a story or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fless's house this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was excited to watch MSNBC instead of recording CNN inside.
He couldn't get away, he couldn't face the future of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows in the past and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but in the end they turned out to be true.

Outside wealth comes crashing in the midterm elections House caucuses
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that has thrown two candidates into a single seat race.
This recently redesigned suburb of Pittsburgh district is fronted by Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which is tightly aligned with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn following a January decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the old districts were run secularly in favor of Republicans.
The new 17th edition of the contest touches on the campaign finance slugfest between the main party finance bosses, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a narrowly contested special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
That seat retained a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a bit of an edge.
US imposes fines on El Salvador for cooperating with China, then backtracks
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a steady retreat from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June and also had a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization's Management 2017 team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of US diplomatic missions due to current decisions not to recognise Taiwan from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, Department spokeswoman Nari Hidar Nourette said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalty is only for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic cooperation.
The proposed penalties, which included deductions on financial aid and targeted visa bans, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials backed off a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity similar to the one last year that was seen as a step towards efforts to stop people migrating to the United Nations.
But by mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, effectively ending any idea of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the summit, which will be held in mid-October, the diplomats said, gathering the administration in the sign of imports.
And three American ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House declined to comment on details of the discussion that were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thought discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were backed up by an outside analyst who is close to the management and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a book of history.
The shoe can then be put on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstructions to Mr Trump's justice, which now has very solid evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his research to whether Mr. Trump's campaign collided with the attack on his election in Russia.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will see himself facing accountability in that system, as he prepares to go up against a panchayat of voters and perhaps his colleagues at the end.
There are many possibilities, and I am not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - or that he will not be summoned to Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the West had stopped it and backed up the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the chance to stop the genocide that was to come.
The direction of the foundations of history and the unsteady movement of democracy are accelerated or delayed around such points of divergence.
Americans now face some of these points of divergence.
If Mr. Trump expels Deputy Law Officer Rod Rosenstein, who is the person controlling the future of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what will we do?
Rosenstein has been beset by problems since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' account is inaccurate.
How would we respond if the F.B.I. investigation at Brett Kavanaugh's request was not complete or consistent - or if the Supreme Court upheld credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a mediator for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will last a long winter.
But I think that we will not be disappointed because of the teaching that I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic home.
She survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future when he is with me as my legacy?"

Ranger Graham Dorrance is optimistic ahead of the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that following an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win over the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify from Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance until the season ended in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for even greater things.
It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game thinking we could get something and came up with a point.
Maybe we could have won it near the end but a draw was probably a good result.
They were probably good in the first half and we came in the second half and were on the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the backing of the crowd with us, I am sure that we can go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, all the things that happened like my injuries and the changes in the club itself are also a factor that now feels good for the place.
The group is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move forward, we can leave the past behind us and succeed".
Women are losing sleep because of the fear of this retirement crisis.
Although survey respondents had no idea how they wanted to be cared for, some people talked about it with their family members.
In a national study, almost half of the individuals said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take steps to communicate, said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
This is going to be where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important component in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor may also be able to help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your fund choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance plan, a cash-value combination life insurance plan to cover these costs, or a self-insurance plan with your own assets as long as you have money.
Get your legal documents out of the way quickly. Get legal battles out of your head quickly.
Get a health care replacement so that you can hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to tell.
Also, consider having a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Keep those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the money that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep it planned".
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air gun while walking home from a night out.
The victim, Devon, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracobena when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as an "unplanned act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the communication disruption, relief officials could not get any information from Donggala region north of Palu, located near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the devastating quake.
Here are some key facts about Riki Palo and Dongola, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau A, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of the Narrow Bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a coastal region with a length of over 300 kilometres (180 mi) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The administrative region, an administrative region below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstay of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agencies, in the last 100 years, Palu and Dongola have been hit by several tsunamis.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred homes in Dongola.
A tsunami also hit West Dongola in 1996, claiming nine lives.
Indonesia is situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On Dec. 26, a major earthquake in Aceh province of North Sumatra on the west coast of Indonesia triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people living on the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, spawning a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: Behind Sumatra, a 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the province of Aceh, causing damage and uproar as people remember the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sara Palin has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troops on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reporting and obstructing arrest.
According to the police report, when a female companion tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone from her.
Palin is being interrogated at the pre-match-su trial facility and held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely not guilty" when asked about his plea, the network noted.
Palin is facing three Class A felonies, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sara Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, one count of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sara was criticized in 2016 by a group of parenting veterans after linking her son's hisc behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake has rocked a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been grounded and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake just hit the back of Central Sulawesi, which is located north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of shock are circulating on social media.
Several hundred people gathered in the city of Palo for a beach festival when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sefollo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence never given in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a home depot hired truck to attack a bike path along the west side highway in lower Manhattan, dispatching pedestrians and cyclists in his path on Oct.
According to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of those reasons make a possible provision of the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury reprimanded Saipov on a 22-count charge that included eight counts of murder with embezzlement, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime prosecutions, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and predetermination", describing how Saipov acted in a "hateful, cruel and deprived" manner, the lawyers said.
The notice of intent states that the Saipov soldiers, including the soldiers of the army, have caused injury and damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, Ann Lauri Dicat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernando de Mondaza and Alejandro Damián Panucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been almost a decade since the Southern District of New York held a capital punishment trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted and sentenced two years earlier on charges of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was prompted to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that ISIS flags be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He has requested not to convict the 22 accused for the charges.
David Paton, one of the federal public defender's lawyers representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to proceed.
"We think that demanding the death penalty rather than accepting a plea of guilty to life imprisonment without any possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these incidents for everyone involved", Petan said.
Saipov's defence had earlier asked the lawyers not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage took the oath to rally the people's army during a protest at the Tory convention today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had felt warmth from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that she should remain in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Boone said in Birmingham in March that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary the UK would have 'gone out' by now.
But the challenge Mrs May is facing to regain her deeply divided position is underscored by the pro-Remain Tories who have joined a separate opposition to Brexit in the city.
The president is struggling to maintain his checkered compromise plan amid attacks from Brexiters, reminers and the EU.
The allies stressed that despite the strong negative reaction, she would go ahead by trying to negotiate a deal with Brussels - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her support and chaos.
Mr. Bone said that the people wanted to get rid of the Chechers.
You suggested that Mr. Ferrej should be made a partner and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If they were in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to get rid of the checkers.'
Establishing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight the world wars to remain a follower.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bo rejected the suggestion that the 2016 election had changed public opinion. The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.
Andrea Jenkins, a Tory Brexitist, was also in the march, telling reporters: "I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Cheka is not popular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for him, it is unpopular with our group and our activists who actually work in the streets and help us get elected in the first place.
Please put the checkers down and start listening.'
In a directed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers save their jobs when they keep your promises.'
Shri Farage said the rally politicians should do so that they feel the warmth if they are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It is now a matter of trust between our people - and our political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not leave you after we do.'
In a message to the excited crowd, he said: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel warm.
'We are uniting the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not give up until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, survivors marched across Birmingham before holding a two-hour parade through the city centre.
After the group started this weekend, a cheering crowd of activists held up anti-Brexit Tory banners.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives with a party app for the safety issues he was bothered with as soon as the convention opened.
'These are the people who are telling us that they can put systems in place and all the technologies for Canada plus plus so that there is frictionless border, so that there is free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete mockery.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans a tough look for the president's ticket
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will take a "tough look at the presidential race" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Dill, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She may have been at the center of speculation that would go against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was Trump's 36th meeting with elements using the town hall format since taking office.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied, 'It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it covers a woman at the top.'
Arrested in death from gunshot wounds to LSU seams
Police in Baton Rouge, La. announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Row Police Department announced the arrest of Dyson Simson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He released a video asking for help to identify a man seen in the footage on Friday.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University Pathanam early on Friday.
Wade died from a gunshot wound to the head on Sims and eventually as a result, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, per 247 Sports.
Wade came to his friend's rescue and Simpson Wade was shot dead.
Simmons was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, being armed, and Wade admitted to shooting Simmons.
Simson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Row Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games with the Seams last season scoring 10 touchdowns and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title by defeating Sebastian Vettel at the team's orders
It became clear for a moment that when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that Team Manavel would play a big part in the Mercedes race.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and hung out to almost dry Hamilton as he defended his place in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his group-mate.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton in traffic in the tail of the bulk, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes then pitched a lap and the Vettel came behind, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw a Ferrari driver unhappily leaving the inside which was free of the risk of being caught after a double-step to the defence at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid on his 21st birthday and came seventh at the end of the first round.
He then leaned on his tyres for fourth, to reach a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen to lead a large part of the race.
On lap 44 he finally came into the pits, but was unable to increase his pace over the remaining eight laps as Ryokan took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Voltaire did a great job over the weekend and was told by a real gentleman.
"The team did an exceptional job of having one or two", said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not rip off a letter from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh alleging sexual harassment by Christine Blassy Ford.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly comment on Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were selfish and bad and untruthful".
One thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see the people who are angry and selfish and mean and lying, he said.
When you see the releases and the leaks and then they say oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this.
What is the answer?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - Oh oh where?
Oh, not at all.
I did not leak".
Anyway, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, we linked it to the influence of the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford in late July detailing the charges against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak his words, Finstin told the committee, Hill reported.
And she said unto me, Keep it secret; and I kept it secret, as she said.
But she did not seem to have any objection to sitting down with the president, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "What I'm telling you is that it was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Moving forward with his defense of the Supreme Court defendant charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own benefit.
They are determined to recapture the necessary power by any means.
You can see that selfishness, panic, they don't care who they are harming, they have to run for power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars hit back at Dundee on Friday to win 5-3 to make up for the Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants.
The Giants were given a two-goal lead in the opening round by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bluvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney restored the Giants' lead before Dwyer brought home the side level.
Francois Bouchard tied with Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen scored two goals to secure his victory.
Adam Keefe suffered a third Elite League defeat of the season for Mann, who were to be beaten 2-1 by Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford providing the assist as BlueVilliers doubled promotion after four minutes.
Sullivan brought home the home side back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquart became the provider to tie Coveney at 15:16 in the busy opening period.
Dwyer ensured that when Ante scored his second goal on the first night, the Giants won promotion at the first break.
The home side regrouped and once again Bouchard put it into level term with a power play goal at 27:37.
In the first match, Colney and Charles Corcoran jointly assisted Neilson to give him the lead with a stick and secured the victory in the final session with his team's fifth halfway.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are in their next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies saving thousands of people from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after it was confirmed that he had safely taken off from the ground a plane carrying thousands of people.
More than 800 people were killed and others missing after a major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks could devastate the region and many are trapped under the rubble in Palo-Nagar.
After his colleagues escaped for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunwan Agunge, who was stationed at Mutiara Sis Al Juffari Air Base in Palu, refused to leave his post at the Dolta control tower.
He was working to ensure that Battic Air Flight 6321 could take off safely.
When he saw the watchtower falling down, he jumped from it.
Then she died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirit said the decision could save thousands of lives, ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to take us from Balikappan in Kalimantan to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him before reaching Palu by helicopter this morning.
He added, "Our hearts are broken when we hear this.
Meanwhile, officials feared the death toll could reach thousands, telling the country's Disaster Management Agency that the towns of Dongola, Sighi and Boutong were out of reach.
Agency spokesperson Sutopo Puro Nugroho said that while many people have not been reached, it is believed that many bodies are still buried under the rubble.
Waves up to six meters high have destroyed Palu, with a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies.
Reza Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing in a body.
Fresh water is scarce.
Every minute the mini market is coming to a standstill.
Jan Galfende, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It is already a tragedy but it could be worse than this".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night, because the work related to evacuation can be completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, an earthquake hit Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea now says one person is missing after Lagoon plane crash
That single-line operated flight crashed in Micronesia's Pacific Lagoon, now showing one person missing, while earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that the account was unavailable for the male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, the hospital and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit water as it tried to land at the Chuak Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable at the time.
Why these things have happened, and why they have not been known?
Both the airlines and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane would overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Janice said the plane had come down very low.
"That's a good thing", said Janice.
Janice said that she and others managed to escape in the sinking plane by crossing the water to the waist for emergency evacuation.
The flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and they were also injured.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors repairing on a nearby beach also assisted in the rescue using inflatable boats to rescue people before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
The data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but it does not include air pollution.
The nighttime timeline analyzer shows that the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday handed down a decision in the case of a man who had filed a reconsideration petition for the burning of a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rollett testified as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He mentioned to the jury how he used his cell phone records to piece together the activities of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rolette said they obtained location data from several cell phones, which refuted Tallis' earlier claims showing that Tallis was with her on the evening of Chambers' death.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers, he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police had gone to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford took the stage and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tallis was telling the truth about whether he was in the truck with Sanford that night, he said that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tallis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that the couple had known each other for a week.
Rolette said that shortly after Chambers' death Talis deleted Chambers' text, call and contact information from his phone.
He wiped her out of his life, Hal said.
His final arguments are scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said that he hopes to take the case before the jury later that day.
Elite: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The elite from Bristol claimed that the hip hop movement had drifted away from its roots of political message and settlement of communal issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-populate conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
One more black guy?!
NY Nanny sued the couple after a racist text
A mother complaining after receiving an inappropriate text saying she was another black person is filing a discriminatory dismissal suit against a New York nanny couple.
The couple denied being racist, comparing the lawsuit to money laundering.
Lyncy Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed to learn that her new nanny Giselle Morris was unwell on her first day of work in 2016.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
However, she sent the virgin Maurice twice instead of sending her husband.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her mistake, an unruly Plasco-Felxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the current nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad thing and she was expecting a Filipino in the place.
The maid Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home with a blanket.
Now, Morris is filing for damages to dismiss the couple, and is seeking damages of $350 per day for six months, initially hiring her for residential work, but without a contract.
I want to show you that, look, you can't do that, she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination".
Responding to claims that the couple were racist, he said it was right to terminate Morris' employment, fearing that he could not be trusted after he was humiliated.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, President Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you hand your child over to someone you thought was wrong, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Let go".
Comparing the campaign to a money recovery campaign, Plasco said his wife was months away from having a baby and she was in a very difficult time.
You're going after someone, right?
This is not a good thing, said the investment banker.
While the legal process is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has reacted swiftly to the condemnation of the couple on social media, condemning their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared the reader would not associate with a talking bear, a new letter published.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to keep a first-time reader in the seed before publishing.
We now know that the huge success of Paddington is a big surprise".
Says her father, who was inspired to write a children's book by a small toy bear, previously worked as a BBC cameraman, jokingly told her about giving up his job, told her that the books were 60 years old, then died last year.
Paddington, who considers him an important member of his family, said his father was proud of his potential success.
He was an extremely quiet man, and he wasn't a self-righteous man, she said.
But because Paddington wasn't very real to them, it was like if you had a child, who accomplished something: you were proud of it, even though it wasn't actually doing your job.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington.
Though it was his own invention and imagination, he always credited Paddington for it.'
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon discharging her daughter, she was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to revive her.
Ned was always calling to say that this was really bad, because he didn't expect it to succeed, said Mrs. Eden-Laperosai.
Then I got a call from Ned that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
You will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors gave her medication for pumping her heart, which was slowly losing effect and leaving her system.
She had recently given up the body and it was all over.
Even though I knew all that, I just had to sit there and wait for him.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I actually had to deal with this".
Then Mrs. Adnan-Lapperhaus, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the mental anguish she was enduring.
No one knew, she said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to understand, but it was on that flight, I felt this overwhelming sense of empathy for Ned.
That he deserved my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Victims post-cards to stop suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are posting an inspirational message and phone number on the Seth Whelan Bridge, where people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old, from which he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day, she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, told them that their son was a promising chef with a smiling face.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
He always said that his memory would light up any room".
However, before his death, he was left in "a place of deep darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was looking for his brother who committed suicide.
"I am constantly worried that there is going to be a knock on effect", Ms. Davis said.
Mrs. Davis held up a card to show people that there are many people they can go to and talk to, even if it's not just friends.
Don't sit silent - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphries, who has been Mrs. Davis's partner for years, said that shortly after Mark's mother died, she lost her 15-year-old partner Mark.
Never tell him that he's feeling sad or depressed or anything, she said.
A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his temper.
He was devastated on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't even see them or anything".
Her death was a shock to her, but she has to work through it: "It's a hole in the family.
This is what separates us.
But we all have to keep fighting".

The future of Kuwanua was thrown into doubt as the FBI began its search.
"I thought we could actually get what he wanted - a limited time of search, limited scope - maybe we can bring some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, expressing his concern that the committee was biased and stuck in gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not like an FBI investigation?
They are willing because of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if, as is hoped, the Republican does poorly, he will slacken his efforts to elect the man he wants to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was calling the Senators, he was calling them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had driven to the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its own report?
There will be a Vogue in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would ensure Mike Pence breaks the tie to become Vice President for the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of refugees in North Korea decreased
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byong-seok of the Southern Integration Ministry, citing figures, said there were 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the acceptance of high fees by people smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of refugees from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
The highest number of fleeing took place via China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross between the two Koreas in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) of high security.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants who do not accept refugees, and repeatedly forcibly send you back.
The relationship between North and South - which is still technically at war - has improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for a talk, with the focus on the issue of nuclear disarmament.
This follows the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York that without any confidence in the US, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "historic", unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for the nature of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments at a reveal at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't help but think that if a woman has ever demonstrated like this, it would be 'historical,'" Pelosi said Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony.
Kwaneagle emotionally denied allegations that he had sexual intercourse with Dr. Christine Blasley Ford while they were both in a coma.
Talking about his family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional during his opening statement, speaking almost loudly and choking several times.
He explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee for their alleged "violent and coordinated character assassination" by liberals, which led to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court because it makes it clear that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself by the statements and style in which he went after Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh, Pelosi expressed skepticism if this were confirmed and if the Democrats managed to win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will do it", Pelosi said, "If he is not showing the reality to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be in the Supreme Court, not just the Court of Justice".
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential clash against the Due Diligence Act or Roe v. Wade because it comes down to a conservative justice system.
During his confirmation hearing, Kwaneaghe ignored the question of whether he would overturn some decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that this is not the time for the hysterical, biased to go to court, and Amara is expected to say that this will not go well.
And women need to do this.
It is a fitting comment in months and years because of the anger that she cannot get out of it without Roddy.
We cry when we are angry, Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is unusual, do you?
She went on to say, "I was helped by a woman who was an employee somewhere, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person in front of her, who was talking to her, 'You think I'm sad because I'm crying?'
I'm mad at you".
And she just keeps moving on.
And I think that was sensible".
Tears as part of anger are allowed as an export, because they are perceived as fundamentally wrong.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job in a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying with unspeakable rage, was being caught with a mark on my throat by a woman - a sharp manager, whom I always dreaded a little - who dragged me up a flight of stairs.
Never let them see you cry, she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
He thinks of your grief and is happy because he has come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidential bid.
When Mr. Hart was caught in a botched affair in 1987 called the Monkey Business and was thrown out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed and felt that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
30 years later she's smiling and telling me that it wasn't a well-thought-out decision.
There were already seven participants in the competition and the last thing they wanted was another one.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was delayed, she was behind in raising funds, and so she vowed not to compete until she had raised $2 million.
It was a losing war.
She learned that some supporters, who had given the men $1,000, would only give her $250.
Did they think I was getting a discharge? She was surprised.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run a formal campaign, she went out of her way to express emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money, and anger at the targeting of voters instead of representatives and sexism - where she was trapped.
"You might have thought I was a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You might have guessed that Clenux was my professional sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
Did she cry?""
How the US-China trade war might be worth it for Beijing
Experts believe that the initial phase of the US-China trade war has been dire, and that until the war is over, the long-term benefits for Beijing could increase.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week came with the introduction of a new tariff that affects $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, with half of that being taxed on all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has called for retaliatory action every time, imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods in China alone.
China has promised a short-for-short match with the US, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to hit it anytime soon.
To turn back Washington means to bow to demands, but to bow publicly to the US would be extremely embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing makes its move, the pressure of the US trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that Washington or Beijing could make a quick political decision and create conditions that trigger an economic telespin, or even the reality of what previous observers in the country saw, is even more alarming", said Abigail Grace, a research associate, who looks at Asia for the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to send back refugees
Syria says it is willing to voluntarily return refugees, and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
He said that today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure for moving forward in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing rehabilitation in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu-Aliim said the Syrian administration would welcome assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional assistance or sympathy from countries that sponsor extremism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The US has now lost six times in a row on the European continent and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was crowned, as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjørn reached the 14.5 mark, his necessity to defeat the United Nations.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for the majority of the tournament, dipped his T-shirt in the water at the 16th hole par-3 and won his match against Francesco Molinari.
Since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979, Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his trips, leading 1-0-0 with four players.
The US Jordan Speed, the lowest ranked player in the European team, was knocked out by Denmark's Thorborn Oles with 5&4.
World's top player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who played in what may have been his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European winner of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry but today I am feeling better.
It's been a tough year.
So I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
Emotional with the European win, Garcia said, "This is about the team and I am happy that I was able to help.
He takes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud, I grew up watching the man beat Tiger Woods", said 23-year-old Rahm.
In France, Woods lost all four of his matches and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
The odd figure of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, ranks second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has struggled to get fairway throughout the weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I am proud of these people, these people fought.
It was this morning when we put a little heat on Europe.
We gave up the fight.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is the best captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will all be together once again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 players and am proud to serve as captain.
You have to take off the top of your hat.
We got out".
