A last-minute change?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big move.
The next chance will come in winter.
Petr Čech, currently Chelsea's reserve goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the NH Hotel in Smichovo, talking to Czech journalists and preparing with the Czech national team for the game against the Americans and then for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifiers against the Netherlands.
Chelsea's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has been given the lead in the Premier League this season, the Czech has been promoted to the London club's reserve position for the first time in a decade.
There was some speculation that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in the opening match of the season against Atlético and failed to make it into the league season, losing 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He was two wins and two draws behind in the French league on Sunday, when he shot St. Etienne 5-0.
The club that pushes the most is AS Monaco.
He's 1-1-2 in the league so far and he's a little bit of a 1-1 weekend away from Lille.
There were reports on the English tabloid websites today that Czech might be wanted by Queens Park Rangers.
But according to the English bookmakers, Chech's last-minute departure from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet has a 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll change your shirt in the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but nothing in football is ever 100 percent.
Maybe during the day, he'll get an offer he can't refuse.
What would that offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know what an offer that you can't refuse actually looks like.
It would have to be agreed by all parties, and it would depend primarily on Chelsea's position, whether the club would accept the offer or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a switch now that you're in Prague?
Wouldn't you need to sign a new contract somewhere in the new location?
I haven't thought about it that much.
But in a situation like this, there's a lot of players today, they're all at the national team meetings somewhere, and I'm sure there's a lot of transfers coming up tonight.
So somehow it would certainly be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can afford you?
I don't know.
So you're not pushing me to leave?
The situation where I didn't catch in the first three games of the season is new to me after 15 years of my career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to be involved in this fight for the Chelsea goalkeeper position and it's up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he makes over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I'm taking all the factors into account.
The sporting aspect is important to me, of course, but I also look at it from a personal perspective, which of course includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible you could catch for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan at Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe on his first major visit since winning the May election to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
The list includes, first of all, plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to the Indian intelligence, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after going 125 miles per hour in the 70 km/h speed limit zone and then went into the bush to avoid the police.
Traffic police were trying to stop a blue motorcycle at the Karrata railway station this morning when they noticed it was going 125 miles an hour on the way out of the petrol station on Bathgate Road.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and continued down Burgess Road and then veered into a bush, so the police lost him.
The motorcycle and a person matching the description of the driver were later spotted at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police have charged a 20-year-old with failing to comply with a restraining order and reckless driving.
He'll be in court in Karrat on September 23.
Motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at Nairn and Pitlochry hotels
A man will be arraigned on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charge during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman on 7 June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to the allegation, Webster assaulted her while she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent.
Webster is also charged with the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands of Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Lady Justice Rae has set the date for the trial on 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right.
"The way unions work, the way middle-class jobs work", says Ellison, the Democratic senator from Minnesota who is co-chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to join with the iconic rights advocate John Lewis in introducing a bill to strengthen the status of employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in trade union organising as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-trade union forces from
Amending the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join unions to be sued in civil court - and to seek compensation or damages - is a right and a necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other bill-makers are proposing is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it, when the country was in one breath promoting democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toya's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
Believing that employees and their unions play a role in shaping the new Japan, they included language and openly acknowledged that the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and so they included a clause that openly states: The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements which would restrict or seek to prejudice this right shall be abolished.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a world treaty in 1948, the drafters and Roosevelt included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
Americans have been embracing the basic premise for generations that labor rights are human rights.
When the country was advising other countries on how to build a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to form unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is imperative that we return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and to advocate in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions did not reduce the power of the nation, but expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living for millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to unprecedented levels.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that elevated America and made it the true promise of democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers say would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
An ordinance signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is scheduled to take effect on September 1, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions, and in the meantime they must obtain that permission.
"The petitioner will be able to legally conduct his business while obtaining a permit", states the order of federal judge John deGravells.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get permission.
"Today's decision ensures women in Louisiana are safe from a treacherous law that is designed to deprive them of their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has sued on behalf of three of the five clinics seeking to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to the doctors from the two clinics, who were not among the complainants and are also seeking this authorisation.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional by statute.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Women's rights advocates for abortion, along with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need for such a permit places medical demands on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion objected, saying that the measures were designed to protect women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would lead to clinics being closed.
The Center for Reproductive Rights reports that only one doctor is licensed to perform abortions in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for his own safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said that they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting for a license application to be processed.
Because of late diagnosis and poor treatment availability, ovarian cancer kills more people in rural areas than in urban areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent survived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SOME STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the woman for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were affected by the women's age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socioeconomic status.
The lowest survival rates were found in older women who had been diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says that late diagnosis and poor access to treatment may be factors.
"The disease is best treated by gynecologists, who are usually based in larger cities", she said.
Despite improvements in distance medical services to overcome the distance barrier, she suggested that it would help to strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and support programs for people who are being treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said that the study found that long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are low regardless of geographic location, which highlights the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer is being published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a young mother named Elisha Neave, from the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer at the age of 33.
Garden centers regret declining homeownership
According to a study by the HTA, published by the Financial Times, the decline, coupled with the extraordinary decline in homeownership amongst those under 35, could mean that by the time today's younger generation of consumers reach the "aged-age of gardeners", garden centres will lose up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent out their homes spend on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own gardens.
Other factors threatening the industry, which is worth an estimated £5 billion a year, include the increasing number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the preference for paving instead of front gardens used as parking, and the shrinking size of gardens.
The Greater London area, where the proportion of owned homes has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, has the lowest per household expenditure on garden products in the UK.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have said that sub-tenant housing or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser for the RHS, said: "It is very popular among tenants to grow plants in flower beds - when they move, they can take the plants with them".
The HTA report revealed that the 'golden age' of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher homeownership rate and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year, thanks to better weather, which followed adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at a meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me of Hitlerjugend most of all, had stolen atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture today on democracy.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of a fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both a tense nationalism and a complex of inferiority that can be transformed into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to run differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought the era of wars for domination of Europe was long gone, the East, on the other hand, thought it had been overlooked for a long time and needed to regain its international position.
Such was the mood and frustration in Germany in the 1930's, just before the Nazis seized power and then followed by an outburst of nationalism unlike the situation in Russia today.
And then the totally identical cult of a powerful leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that's pretty similar, really.
Vladimir Putin, and I'm sure a large part of the Russian people, probably miss the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half was trembling.
Maybe the Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe Vladimir was not given enough pat on the shoulder, maybe he wasn't invited to where he wanted to go, maybe he was underestimated and he just acted like a typical Russian male.
He cleaned up the house, pretended he didn't want to go anywhere, and he was sharpening knives at home.
Now he's decided to regain the lost position.
He'll start slow, he'll have time.
The leader's probably on a life sentence, so where's the rush?
He's trampled the Caucasians, now he's trampled the Ukrainians, then it's the Baltic dwarves.
They've been poking the Russian bear for a long time.
I'm sure China will notice, too, which is getting a little too far ahead and is definitely making a move to the Far East.
And those Germans are really pissing off Vladimir, too, how they're having a good time, and we've been giving them a hard time in '45.
How about we make a new Novorossiya in the Charles Wars?
That would be a base, and there's a lot of us there, and they're being oppressed, and they're trying to take down a lot of them.
Our veterans still remember what it was like in Czechoslovakia.
Well, there's their prime minister, Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, he can be robbed like an onion and eat up their whole EU.
That would be a good way to get them to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded where they belong.
And as detonators, we'll use our own people who live on their territory.
There are Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they're just being oppressed, and we're not gonna let that happen, we're gonna protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for he was born for something else.
Europe is only good as a stage, on which proud Ivan can dance the Cossack.
Turkey has summoned an American diplomat over a spy report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain a report of American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish government officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that, according to documents provided by a former US National Security Agency analyst, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report that the German intelligence service was also targeting Ankara provoked a more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones has introduced more fourth-rate tricks
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming the fifth season of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how they'd come up with the fourth-order tricks.
Most visible are the computer-generated versions of the series' environments and the mass scenes where a bunch of soldiers become a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The complainants on Friday presented to the Mallor State Prosecutor's Office evidence of extortion by police and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia Autonomous Region.
The police chief of Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations made by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous Magaluf party district.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after corruption charges were brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario online newspaper, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police and government officials to the mayor of the Calvia municipality to the prosecutor of the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for their links to corruption charges and, along with Navarro, are being questioned by a judge.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted disgruntled nightclub owners as saying that the public officials' favouring had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving", one of the businessmen said in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Island authorities have since tried to keep tabs on drunken and rioters in the ranks of holiday partygoers at Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours to bars.
In addition, the Playhouse, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the Carnage bar tour, to pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is popular with the British, has also seen many accidents involving alcohol, including a fashion wave known as balconing, in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that affected the flight at Adelaide Airport
SUNNY South Australia was hit by a spring frost, with heavy rain and gusty winds that hit Adelaide Airport hard.
Another 5 mm of rainfall is expected in the city until 9 pm and another 6.6 mm during the night on Sunday.
The latest rain came along with several short storm-related flashes of wind that began just before 8 p.m. and brought in nearly 4 millimeters of rain in about ten minutes.
After a few early spring showers after winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again to just 15.8 degrees on Monday.
Stormy weather is believed to have contributed to the delay of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m. at a short distance but was hit by a change in speed or wind direction and was forced to delay landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at the time reached about 30 miles per hour on the ground.
Flight data showed the plane had to be dropped off from the second landing and finally arrived at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently caused further delays including Emirates flights from Dubai and Qantas flights from Sydney.
Temperatures in Adelaide are forecast to reach a high of 16°C on Tuesday and one or two extremes may occur.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars hit their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, but schools in Gaza remain closed as the territory recovers from fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel marked by attacks, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, staff at a rocket-hit kindergarten have removed debris from the wall and are slowly awaiting the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their routines.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that it's "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"We've had some rough times and we haven't left the house at all", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz, near the border with Gaza, to offer his support to the residents.
Until a ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas farther away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Minister of Education said that about a dozen families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study hard, adding: "We will provide you with education and security".
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire, while leading to an immediate cessation of hostilities, did not resolve key issues such as Hamas' demands to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel demands disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians have died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures, estimating that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza radicals have fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country, during the fighting.
The Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in 100 UN schools that have been turned into makeshift shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education like the Jewish children and other children in the world", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in Gaza's largest city.
I'm behind you.
And Lafat is troubled by the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon today for Wednesday's preliminary match against the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands.
Of the 23 members of the squad, Spartan forward David Lafata is having trouble with his temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, with multiple players, and David's probably still having some of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be well as soon as possible", coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it will be two or three days, or tomorrow, will depend on his medical condition, as determined by our doctor", he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some balls, but it's not like they can't train or participate in the game on Wednesday against the USA", the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Vrba called in the last player of the Spartan reserve team, Lukas Vash.
He admitted it wasn't an easy decision, and other midfielders were also in consideration.
I made my decision based on the fact that Lucas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I'm behind it", Vrba told Vác.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata.
It is possible that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still be changed.
On the weekend, the Liberian Josef Šural, who scored a hat-trick, was brilliant.
Of course, there are players who have been showing some form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata is doing.
In the event that he is not available on Wednesday, I do not say that I cannot nominate any of the players who have impressed in the Czech league", Vrba said.
The national team will be training at Strahov this afternoon, and then on Tuesday, the classic pre-game practice before the match against the USA on the Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The match against the Americans is played on Wednesday from 8:15 p.m. and the national team will be looking for their first victory under the Hill.
In the previous three preliminary matches, he had two draws and one loss.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9th at 8:45pm.
Walking on the Dutch to Italy
The Vulture is happy to have more time for training than in previous meetings.
It's an advantage to have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we may not have had so much time for before.
Now we can concentrate on preparing for the Netherlands as best we can", boasted Vrba.
The Dutch will be in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary national coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's from the fight.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a fight and we're gonna film it and we're gonna discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes there are", Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to the most closely watched statistics, winter house prices have risen the most in seven years.
According to the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing value index, home prices rose by 1.1 percent in August, the agency said Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4,2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase amounted to 10,9%, more than doubling in the year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, said that Sydney and Melbourne were leading the market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Other strong markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising by an average of between five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was hit by a government-mandated spending cut and where prices rose by only 1,4% during the year.
Lawless said that with spring now, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "true test" for the market.
"Due to the continued high auction sales, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase further over the next three months", he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands.
They had a cooler relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in a factory.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father, and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melody is upbeat.
Henry, however, had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry has been through extensive therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of the way!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton -- when I was a kid, they were adults -- would go to bars with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a punch in cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he's been a serious guy in the corner, reading the paper.
Henry had recently visited the Dudley foundry, and although conditions were better than in my father's day, he had a glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
It's a little bit lighter now, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy maze where flames are bursting and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad would always get in the bathtub and just lie there, and then you could hear him slowly singing to himself because he was washing the foundry out of himself.
As I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to feed his family, and I started to respect him more.
Yet, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad never hugged anyone, never said "I love you".
It wasn't until Mom got sick and was dying that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, has allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hold me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
He and French, to whom he was married for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn is a good girl.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor said, "You have to make a radical change".
So I started going to a big gym, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it was boring.
Nobody wants to eat the whole carrot.
The change in Henry's career direction may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut chin.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors and The Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone, and he wrote about him in the New Faces talent show.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television".
He learned on the go.
Besides being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I had to learn how to make practical jokes, be a star and act on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny at the New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry ended up performing his comedy for five years.
My family was already upset about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on large stages and learned how to work with crowds.
What was for years and years the prized staple of British television, but was also a grotesque parody of black people.
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, portraying characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known, among other things, as chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him to commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles, but after his show LennyHenry.tv aired on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, because it looks like you're stuck in one place or you're a little out of the way".
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they said, "You should try it".
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 lines of Othell's closing speech for the documentary and was on his way.
It made me feel like I could do it.
Like it gave me courage.
That's what it's about. lt's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the test was tough, and I read the play for months and months before that.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
He soon began acting in Comedy of Errors.
I was at the National Theatre, I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You've changed".
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
A voice in my head said, "Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes".
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me was like, "Hmm, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
You're playing, so stay in the role.
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Fence was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it gives you determination.
The play was also well received, so it's like a sign from God saying, "You should do this".
Of course he says it in a loud voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like the test room.
Henry, however, remains a comedian's brain - interrupting our conversation with humorous performances, entering and leaving the role of impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you might end up in a dead end.
Sometimes I do Live at the Apollo when I want to, but it's not as fun as it used to be.
I asked if he'd ever do another stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director, helping to outline the beginning, middle and end of the journey, I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think you do.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You're always telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers government officials to shed light on non-existent employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants in an attempt to remove non-existent employees from the government payroll.
According to the government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving their salaries.
The government believes that thousands of people are still getting paid after leaving the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to eliminate corruption in government.
An audit this year showed that the state was losing at least $1 million (£700,000) a month in salaries to non-existent employees and other abuses of office.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts after the employee dies or after the employee leaves the government, Wanyama Chebusiri, a BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, said.
All government officials must report to the identification centres within the next two weeks where their biometric data will be recorded, a government statement said.
He also says that anyone who doesn't show up without a proper apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By identifying the actual public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to the economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees", said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "plotting against the government"
Local media reports that 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of plotting against the government.
The police department has not commented on the case.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking officials were among those arrested.
Some of them were implicated in the December corruption investigation that targeted government officials including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities of the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
He told reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he is determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools have held traditional ceremonies on September 1st.
Not all of Ukraine is at peace.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at the school in Slavyanka, where Jacek's daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved and that children will acquire knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons, and giving teachers flowers.
Maybe the BBC found a boss for a hard time in Rhona Fairhead.
It carries with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the Conservative Party.
She has experience on the front lines.
She started her career at consulting firm Bain and Co, then moved on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when her younger colleague took the top job at Pearson's parent company.
They say her severance package was approaching a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise at Whitehall: she became an adviser to a government office.
Her husband is a former city councilman.
In May, I described the director's job as a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is looking in two directions: inside the top tier of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outside the public voice in times of unrest when things aren't working.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
But what CEO would risk coming into a complex company like a Chinese dynasty, breaking it up, and then losing his job?
It's a tough call.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrinking -- its power, its finances -- and its status revised.
As competition expands and new technology challenges old assurances, the immediate negotiation of licence fees poses a major risk to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is arguably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC has a good story: it claims that its output reaches 96 percent of households, and each one costs only 40 pence a day.
And the BBC's popularity is clearly on the rise: 53% of fans, up from 31% ten years ago.
The BBC's usage patterns have changed: Today, I get the headlines on my mobile phone, and I can watch the shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs a great director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims he disapproved of the offensive tweet
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account, released on Sunday, contained an offensive image of the Democratic state's attorney who initiated a criminal charge against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and a second tweet was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
There was an unauthorized tweet from my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I took it down", he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to the questionnaire messages right away.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet posted a grim, humorous image of Travis County State's Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay the funds for her office, which brought Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet read: "I don't always drive with three times the legal blood alcohol level... but if I do, I'm going to sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable".
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry wasn't run by the Lehmberg office.
It was run by Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the presiding judge to dismiss the charges because using the law to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended a $7.5 million state fund for the Travis County-based Public Interest Division that prosecutes corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection was prompted by a formal complaint by a left-leaning group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active, and he's even famous sometimes.
After finishing fifth on his party's Iowa caucus during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done, tweeting a photo of himself running near a lake and saying: "Here I am, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is returning to normal.
One of London's most prominent developers warned that the housing market in south-east England had "returned to normal levels of activity".
High demand for capital housing and rising prices, and widespread concern about the credit bubble, prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's demanding client development company, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from a peak in 2013 to a normal level of transactions". He adds that this provides a "stable environment for operation".
The London housing market did well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far exceeding the 6.7% average in England and Wales.
Average retail prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year, to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, London properties have not been as attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible 'residential tax' that politicians have come up with ahead of next May's parliamentary elections.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for lending, would also slow the growth rate of the market in property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast for London property prices for 2015 to 3%, based on the fact that house prices have already started to fall.
Meanwhile, in London's most expensive neighbourhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, the volume of transactions has fallen by a quarter each year, according to WA Ellis.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a boon for Berkeley, as it increased the cash on the forward sale to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: 'The demand for the right, good looking housing in a good location has remained the same and this has kept forward sales going.'
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 properties between the start of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% to £380 million, revenues by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley said he expected Berkeley's annual revenue to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley's stock has fallen to £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
A hacker posted nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence's photos have been leaked online by a hacker who claims to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of other up-and-coming actresses.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence's photos are real and criticized the hacker for "blatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker allegedly obtained the photos, which were originally posted on the image-sharing service 4chan, through a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system.
It's unclear how many of the photos are authentic, but the movie star Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World, Winstead, also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who are looking at the photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home are happy with yourselves", Winstead tweeted.
Victoria Justice, known for her work on Nickelodeon's "Carly" and "Victorious", denied the photos were real, tweeting: "These alleged nude photos of me are SURVEY, people".
Better cut it in the crack.
Buzzfeed reported Sunday night that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the alleged photos were real.
A special exhibition of Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter J
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually disintegrated like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Just once in a while, some woman tells him he's too serious, complicated, violent, isolated, and maybe a little bit hot.
And then she shook his hand.
He slowly admitted it.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yeah.
The latest casualty of his ability was a fledgling romance that more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even provide some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a frail beauty with wild hair and a flying heart from a village in the North Island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
South came an elderly companion whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who had inherited a property in a wet but beautiful valley called, appropriately, Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, the baths were dead spiders, the snails were signing on the windows like they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown and the weeds were like huge cabbage heads.
The house looked like a cabin from a children's story, scary and yet enchanting, with a garden full of mystery.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the shortlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on stretchers in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying the unexpected warmth of a spring afternoon, in absentia tuning into the public station that was supplying the countryside with comforting music and soothing news, when the sight of her sun-tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comic whose father liked to listen to it with his blinds closed.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they stopped playing songs like that on the radio.
They weren't banned -- really, there was nothing banned -- they just didn't play.
They helped them get into the desuetude, as did the word desuetude itself.
Popular taste has achieved what regulations and outlaw status could never achieve, and just as people in books choose memoirs that make rich men and women cook and romance novels, so in music they choose ballads.
Kavern let the bottom slip and began playing an imaginary piano and in a rough, comical voice he sang serenade to Aileen's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand. She was a little bit confused.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller", he said, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to squeeze the letter J out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
If you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth for a word that started with a "J", it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, though not directly outlawed, didn't play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one If.
When the tune started playing, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Jr. until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father's secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to tell him Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she couldn't remember a time when the favorite singers weren't black.
No laws or coercion.
A leisure society is one in which every part of it gratefully - with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution threw for fun and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, who are naturally gifted with electronics, have taken responsibility for ensuring that no family will ever be without a working telephone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed were dishwashers.
Those in the Gulf and Levant whose grandparents didn't leave the country quickly while what happened, when it happened -- afraid of being accused of setting fires, actually afraid of being consumed by the next fire -- opened restaurants selling firewood and smoking water pipes, ignored themselves, and their inaction slowly fed them.
To each according to his ability.
Since she had only listened to ballads, Ailinn had difficulty understanding how the silly words Kavern had just sung to her could be turned into music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really stupid", said Kevern.
Maybe just for people with big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
There was no word that could be left behind the soundproofing sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put his fingers in her mouth again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny", he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, and obscured Kevern's view.
All over the world, nothing was seen but the mess of her crow-like hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you mean", she said doubtfully.
Still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Am I too big for my legs?
He looked again.
Not so much feet.
Maybe a little bit of ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I'm too fat for my ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have told her I love you, but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are just attracting me, "he tried.
I'm a little bit of a pervert.
That didn't work.
He was trying to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty lurking in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got out of bed, dropped the radio and spilled the untouched wine.
Basin wine, so drinking wasn't the problem.
She seemed to shake in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm pervertedly attracted to you being a jerk", she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear in her eyes when she stood up to him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was basically the same as here.
They were all crushed by the same vast, icy ocean.
The same crazy men, after what happened, even more insensitive and mean than their ancestors, smugglers and corrupters, were raging from pub to pub, ready to lay a hand on any woman who dared to refuse them or laugh at them.
The idiot?
If she doesn't watch out, they'll show her their fists!
First to anoint her-- anointing became the most common term for erotic excitement between a man and a woman: the antithesis of the soft ballads of love that the radio shouted-- first to anoint her, then to murder her.
In Kevern's view, too much cultivation, because the cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons has been nonverbally telling him to leave.
He got out of bed like an old man.
She felt cold herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave, as if watching him from the window on the second floor, a man who had been overtaken by what he had caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was racing for him and for all the men in general, no matter how many of them beat her up.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hanging, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting had left him - why did she feel she knew this look so well, even though she could not remember a single moment, until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher at Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system for public sentiment, wrote a short article about the persistence of mild and moderate violent acts in areas of the country where mitigation or even cessation would be most expected if enough money and energy were spent on eliminating them.
"Much has been done and much more must be done", she wrote, "to calm the innate aggressiveness of people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the arid, hard-to-reach parts of the country, where, even through the tops of church towers that rise above the lively fences, the breath of human kindness has historically been rare".
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the impulses.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour sad stories, and declare a firm belief in the value of marriage and family life, but not only is the old brutality as persistent in rural areas as it is in urban areas, but evidence also shows that new and aggressive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, on the roads, and even on sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too floral", said her superior.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum has her head down.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't feel I have to answer that", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme has once again protected her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking because", Rabinowitz said at last, "I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a certain kind of oversensitivity, which is in itself entirely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the Church - things that you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still dealing with what happened, when it happened, as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, prepares the earth with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
Behind his head, the light board flashed in pink, the recommendations Ofnow had been sending out to the world for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations", replied Esme Nussbaum, quietly, when she was sure that her superior had finished, "and I no longer claim that the wound had not healed as we pretend it had.
My main concern is that if we don't get a heads-up, we're gonna make the same mistake that led to what happened, if it happened.
But this time, we won't vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz has connected the fingertips.
That was supposed to mean infinite patience.
"You're going too far", he said, "by describing the steps your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You're going too far to talk about letting your anger and distrust out on others.
I shouldn't remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we're not talking about us and them.
There were no "myths" and there were no "things".
All we know is that it was a chaotic time.
During which, if we're honest with each other, we've taken the courage to say that none of us are without fault.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on that.
And just as there is no blame to be laid upon anyone, there are no things to be corrected, even if correction is appropriate and possible.
But what is the past for other than to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If I may add anything to that -
Luther Rabinowitz has severed the fingertips.
"I will consider your report", he said, and let her go.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on the sidewalk in a manner that passersby described as "brutal and furious".
Coincidences are what happen.
Lesotho army says no coup is planned - Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government, and claim they were acting against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After he declared that he was being threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family fled to the neighboring Republic of South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it was not actually a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the command of the Kingdom of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups in the police ranks planning to arm some radical political fanatics who were about to cause havoc in the country", he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be coup d'état", he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said that soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
During Thabana's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be in charge of the government.
Thabane stated that he believes he is being targeted because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliament due to internal disputes, tensions have been building in Lesotho.
He stated that despite the contrary claims, his actions did not undermine the government.
Euro area production at 13-month lows
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low in the euro area in August, according to a closely monitored survey.
The euro area purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 means expansion.
New orders were coming in, and the factories were damaged by the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from the Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want the bank to come up with a clear plan for dealing with the euro area's long-term recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB President Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the UK and US embarked on during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers is becoming more visible", said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
Anxiety reigns over France, Italy has again gone from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are not too reassuring either", said Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of further monetary or tax stimulus.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August Production Overview by Purchasing Managers is that it shows the sector is still growing".
He added: "The lives of euro area producers are very difficult at the moment, as the increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries.
This growing uncertainty has clearly affected trade - in particular consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially expensive ones.
He stated that it appears as 'even more likely' that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, although we expect it to be limited.
Ten years of Beslan survivors' hell: Ten years since the horrors of the occupied school, children still suffer
Ten years ago, Chechen radicals took 1,000 people hostage at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day ordeal that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Ten years after the horrific Beslan school occupation that killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night, the survivors of the Holocaust warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and their parents, it seemed like the deepest depths of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy has united East and West, leading to negotiations and a future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to look for some of the victims who had escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who defied the odds, even though the memory of the terrorists' hell will live on in them.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - should be over.
Girl trying to climb back into the destroyed school gym
She was captured by a leading Russian photographer, Dmitry Beliakov, trying to climb back into the bombed-out school gymnasium in her underwear after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused, Aida searched desperately for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't", Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
I've got pieces of shrapnel in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it", she said, determined.
It just happened to me, and there's nothing I can do about it.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed behind.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jer Gapoe, was killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined going to school together.
I don't want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at a picture of myself walking out the school window on the Internet, I think, "A lot of people will see this for the first time, understand this disaster, and prevent it from happening again".
The boy who escaped a shower of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school at seven years old) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand".
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said, "Run".
He was afraid she was dead, so he ran and saw the babies crying, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother is dead".
He says, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom, lying in the hospital with a broken leg, thinking that her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I cried with joy".
I couldn't believe it.
He came running in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the now-defunct News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it", he said yesterday.
But I can tell you, the memories are fading.
I remember right after that I threw all my guns at the playground.
But now I can play computer games where you shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they never got out.
We'll never say they were killed or that they died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially the way I could pick whatever I wanted at the toy store, and the way I drove a convertible.
But now he worries about places like Ukraine, where the war is hurting as much as it did for him and his friends.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I feel very sorry for everyone who has to go through such horror", says Damir, who participated in the monastery's volunteer activity last week.
I really want to help.
I want to work for the police one day, and I hope to get into the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: "They killed 37 kids from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence after the attack, no children running around screaming, and it lasted for months.
He vividly remembers the trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir was craving borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters at the restaurant, and Damir was shooting at them with a water pistol and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised at how the British were willing to share our pain and how they supported us.
She said, "I still don't think the world has changed for the better in the last ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think there have been and will be many children killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up to be a nice, quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that.
I know she doesn't like to remember it, but she's very close to six of her classmates, and she goes to the gym every once in a while and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had a problem with it - I remember sometimes he would lie on the couch with his face turned away from us, sometimes for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his pistols or other weapons to play with.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was sure he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I came to my senses after the explosion, I stood up, looked around, and I saw hell, pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy had no chance of surviving this hell.
I remember screaming "Damire, run, run!" but I was sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran.
So our lives go on unlike any other.
Grigory Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
As he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was etched into his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her eldest son, Vladimir, to university.
"I was dressed two minutes before the terrorists stormed the courtyard, so my little boy was left alone there for three days", she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's harder and harder to think about it and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that tragedy is not remembered.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, it feels like it was yesterday, there are moments that keep coming back.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Recurring memories: The picture of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigory was so excited about school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Gregory crying in San Marino.
Grigori doesn't like to look at the picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand, but I also think that because of this picture, people all over the world know the pain we feel.
Today Grigory says: "It is important that this does not happen again.
I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragedies like this are always investigated, but no one ever finds out the truth.
They're investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is about to go bad.
I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes decades for us to forget a little.
It affected my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
Then, in 2004, when I went back to school, I was terrified every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I go to the gym when September 1st is coming.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
I graduated this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20 years old
The boy who survived being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miraculously, Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but he survived
While the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym, sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like yesterday", said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but couldn't because of injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's always with me, it's not something I've thrown away.
Now that I'm older, it's said that children are better at dealing with bad experiences - I have to say, that's not true.
I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 -- the year after that -- that was the first and last time I ever stepped back into the gym.
I fainted.
I'm never going back there again, and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in this well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on his laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is so great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally now.
But still, my health did not allow me to enroll and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they said that it was impossible.
My other hobby is animals, so I went to veterinary school.
I finished my second year there.
He's learning how to treat all animals from kittens to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my kids about this.
It's not something kids should know about, let alone experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain will be here forever.
He's in and he's getting worse with the anniversary coming up.
I'm attending the memorial service.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God for giving it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult now, but he carries the horror with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's over the horror by about 50%, but you can't overcome it completely and forget.
This terrible experience will be with us forever.
Many of our friends and neighbors were killed in the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I've lost a lot of people that I loved and that were close to me.
My son is with me and it's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm hurt to lose those killed.
I know families with other children, but also widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even when you don't want it to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost popped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is coming to our country now, which I can hardly believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, so how did we get to be fighting each other now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could just round up all these rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A child who was taken to safety by a special task force
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is being taken to safety by Russian special command (left).
Now ten years old (right), she has no memory of the tragedy
The world was stunned in 2004 when little Alyona was rescued from a Velshan detention center by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but they kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gymnasium.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and with his new wife Svetlana they have a daughter, whom they named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown up to be a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend stated that they are a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the kids away from the memories that the tenth anniversary brings.
You can see why.

4 tips for better underwater photography and video
If you're interested in photography or underwater filming, you have a wide range of equipment.
The cheapest options are compact cameras like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with a couple of cameras, all for less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly sealed.
Next, adjust the camera to the type of photo or video you're going to take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scene or filming mode that optimizes exposure in dark underwater environments.
And before you do, figure out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed for 5 feet, others for 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof versions.
Always take a few shots - many of them don't work.
Compact cameras have LCDs that help you compose your photos, but outdoor cameras don't.
Even if you have an LCD, you can't see underwater and the composition of the image is unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If your camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of images with slightly different exposure spacing, use that.
Stay close to the surface.
It's shrinking significantly with the deeper light.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake, or sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you see.
Get close to the subject of the photograph.
That's great advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important if you're shooting with an outdoor camera: These devices usually have a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that if you want to fill the frame, you have to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of character could make a difference even in an organisation as large as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the pain of sickness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the effects of torture that crippled him.
Lawson realized that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, the vast majority of patients they treat are interested in something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel myself", he wrote in May of that year.
I felt like I was out of energy.
He was struggling with the symptoms of the flu and found himself impatient and his wife Juliet was surrounded by guilt.
He noted: "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later".
When Juliet left for a week's business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague did a chest X-ray.
Once two weeks earlier he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pancreas or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to tell what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material that was once called "miraculous" but is now known to be deadly - is the cause.
For most of us, mesothelioma wasn't hard to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous form of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on industrial use of asbestos came into force.
Even when asbestos was in use, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation contractors, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
Toxins used in industry in another era hardly seem to be cause for concern today.
That's not the way to be self-righteous.
As it turns out, the UK is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
The death rate from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths from the disease each year are twice as many as those from car accidents.
Number of mesothelioma deaths per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
Mesothelioma is not just a disaster for veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
So the mesothelioma doesn't respect social class, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged towers from London department stores to public schools are no place to hide.
Even the House is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals that should be treating us are the repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even put in the isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come in contact with the asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement hallways of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice", he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the hallways.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been practising at Guy's Hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive".
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17th of this year.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is unusual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
Disease is always fatal.
So now we can just repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pett, a leading British expert on mesothelioma, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic occurs in Britain, some 90,000 people will die.
Most of them have no idea that they're going to die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory glance at the court records, which are frequently consulted by the disabled in their demands for compensation, shows how widespread the mesothelioma disaster has become.
For example, this June Marks & Spencer admitted that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, overseeing two stores in the clothing section - one of the locations being the company's flagship, the Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, she has two children in their 20's.
Before that, he says, I'd never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed it would touch me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
Asbestos is not actually one substance but a group of six minerals.
It is named for its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found building material today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals, and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a "major health risk" that can cause death.
But the most dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocodilelite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that "there is compelling but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high prevalence of mesothelioma [in the UK]".
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in a flagship store on Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pete's work suggests that her story is not at all unusual.
His study of patients states that a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the routine use and ventilation of buildings.
No one seems to know for sure that he's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the centre of government may not know they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that service elevators and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as a "strong current of air".
Ministers are often accused of being self-serving, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Parliamentary Services has insisted that Westminster Palace be given a 'due diligence' medical certificate, it now expects that it will take £1 million and several years of work to have Parliament thoroughly inspected, electricity upgraded and asbestos removed, and that after the 2015 election MPs will be sitting in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre premises rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report says that the presence of asbestos is not in compliance with several regulations.
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One person who was never able to determine when he was exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven", he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked, when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers a day in early December of 2009 when something like a cold snap hit him.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of surgery.
I was shaking.
It just came out of nowhere.
I was so upset.
I thought I couldn't drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the chest, the lumps around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused doctors did chest X-rays and inserted a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
Still, they didn't make the diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he exercised and took a breath.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came into the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott made no connection to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had come into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling sick, a camera-equipped probe was placed in the space between his chest cavity and his lung cavity.
I'm an optimist.
I tend to take things lightly, he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results came in between Christmas and New Year's, and they told me it was mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the sisters of the Macmillan charity, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"Asbestos has been shown to be used extensively, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipes", he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now starting to get sick.
So mesothelioma is now starting to affect younger people who don't have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes were in the basement of hospitals, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (like Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
As it turns out, for decades after the war, hospitals were a place where patients could save lives, but also a place where the lives of the doctors who treated them could be endangered.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Bunsen's students were building their own huts on asbestos pads.
And it's not just the hospital.
Asbestos has been used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls for its excellent insulation and nonflammability.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos in school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students would build Bunsen's shovel on an asbestos mat.
Websites have been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmful items like floor tiles or roofing for tools in our homes were commonly contaminated with asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison built into a large number of homes", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman with mesothelioma could remember was in the 1970s when a garden house was demolished.
So be careful when you're ruining the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while to get it", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was moving from doctor to patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand", he says.
I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I was told it was 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna live to see another Christmas".
That's it.
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive -- the very breathing -- is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the cartilage and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibres in the shape of needles", explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is, paradoxically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson has known and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos, probably during their hospital practice.
Asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, says Treasure, and the breath itself pushes them to the edge where the bulge is.
It's invasive by nature from the beginning.
The treatment options for mesothelioma that are commonly used for other types of cancer are not as effective.
There's a heated debate about the effectiveness of the operation, for example.
Some people say it's worth a try.
Treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the pancreas", he says.
You can't get a scalpel around it.
The cancer doesn't respond well to chemotherapy, which has some effect but doesn't cure.
"Sometimes there's someone who survives lung cancer", says Treasure.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After his diagnosis of mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for people with the same condition.
When they called, he introduced himself happily: "Good morning, you've reached the cancer center".
"It was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago and he was still very active.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would likely extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I was about to give up.
But Lawson was able to put things in a more optimistic light.
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the department of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called them and they did a background check", Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request and they would have to approve his payment.
For mesothelioma patients, money is the key to getting the best treatment available.
But when various treatments inevitably fail, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're going to the courts and demanding compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan at Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But in the 1960's, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it could pose a health risk.
And here we are faced with corporate negligence.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that the asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Confining exposure to deadly asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades after it has happened - has proved a huge challenge for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former jobs have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
The insurance records are gone.
And those who are now defending themselves with the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this, important new legislation was passed this year to make it easier for patients with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, paid for by insurance companies, for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they've been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that would normally be awarded to them by the court as compensation - approximately £120,000.
Each year, 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like his mesothelioma patients, thinks £350 million is a good deal.
"It's an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies", he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have had to pay if time had not intervened and people with mesothelioma were able to reach out to their former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Secretary of Labor and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had loopholes.
But Penning and Morgan admit that with seven deaths each year, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering too much and need help now", Penning said last December during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
Radiation and chemotherapy followed the surgery - a triple treatment that Lang-Lazdunski boasts of a five-year survival rate of up to 40%.
Abbott was strengthened.
"That's not the most important thing", says Abbott.
You see it with patients all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March of 2012.
He completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy in late August.
The follow-up examinations showed no signs of illness.
I went for another check in March [2014].
I had several [cancer] spots scattered throughout my chest.
My 50th birthday was just around the corner.
It's not life-threatening.
It's taking him.
Abbott went through six more cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no evidence of a tumor in his body at this time.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or showing a woman how the alarm clock works on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents", he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
This is the kind of conversation that all cancer patients have to face.
But in mesothelioma patients, these conversations are not taken lightly by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
Illness brings with it (and eventually brought with it to Stephen Jay Gould) a joyless certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, mesothelioma is not life threatening.

During World War II, ships were being built intensively, and working in shipyards posed the greatest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal upholds the first successful claim for damage to health from asbestos exposure in the UK.
World production of asbestos is increasing to more than 4 213 000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Health and Safety Authority requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
In Britain, the use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
In the United Kingdom, the mesothelioma Act is coming into force.
A $350 million compensation program is in place.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material in many parts of the world.
World production is holding at two million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose its leadership - protesters promise revenge
Despite the growing debate over democratic reform, the Chinese parliament decided on Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
The move is likely to trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows the Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We were not surprised, but we were outraged", said Representative Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defence of China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards, the people will be able to vote for the executive.
Chinese leaders have touted Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, as it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also clearly indicates that Chinese leaders are firmly in control of the nomination process, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who love the country and Hong Kong will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer months saw some of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in years.
Most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are led by the Occupy Central Movement, whose organizers have threatened to close down the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the rally, organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
They didn't give any further details, obviously to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement considered occupying the Central only as a last resort in case all options for dialogue were exhausted and there were no other options.
We regret to announce that all options for dialogue have been exhausted today and the occupation of the headquarters is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities prepared for days for Beijing's announcement, and on Sunday, they stepped up security at the government headquarters, placing police and barricades.
Many Hong Kong residents see the unrest as a sign that the city is slowly losing control.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values like democracy and freedom of speech are being circumvented by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying their demonstrations threaten the trade - a lifeboat for Hong Kong.
"The protest he's talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people are participating and for how long", says politician Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of hand.
Such a perception could damage the investment.
Chinese state media have also in recent days come out with reports portraying democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The campaign?
The League in Jihlava is named after a political movement
A small kick is played in the regional town of Vysočina by about 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their top competition is now called the Southwest League.
It's named after a movement that's going to the October municipal elections.
And the top 10 candidate is the head of the small kicking in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a big pile where there was no problem", said Cloud.
The situation around the first League of Small Kickers was already being addressed by the lawyers of the City of South Kivu and recommended changing the system of subsidy distribution.
The little kick earned last year, according to the city's website, about a million crowns.
This year, it's hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the small-kick procedure is not contrary to the law or the directives of the magistrates.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to amend the rules for granting grants and subsidies", said Radek Tulis, spokesman for the magistrate's office.
Pulling subsidy from the city and simultaneously expressing a little bit of kick-ass support in the election for one political party, that's probably not going to work anymore.
No such demand has yet come from politicians for high-profile football.
That there would be a CZSSD regional division, an ODS division or a KDU-CZSL 1.
And class and competition?
I wouldn't say yes.
On the contrary, I would like to have sponsors from among the companies turn to us", said the president of the regional football association Miroslav Vrzáček.
The little football boss of the other party and the movement in the name of the league won't let
According to the players, this small-scale sport in Jihlava deserves its own complex with six playgrounds, changing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the stadium Na Stoupách is not ours, we are there in lease", said Ondrej Lapes from the club Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a nonsensical area for skateboarders, of which there are about 50 in Jihlava", Mráka pointed out.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), reacted that the small kibbutz is using the artificial grass playground in Rošický and Na Stoupách streets, which are in the city's property.
We want to build a stadium that's maximizing its use.
We're planning to upgrade or build sports fields near schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a lot of progress has been made for the little kick in the last few years", Vymazal added.
No other political parties in the league will appear according to Jan Mračka.
We have our limitations.
If someone from one sector enters our partnership, we don't let the other one", he explained.
"Political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step", said Karel Voldán, a member of the city's sports committee.
"But let the voters decide whether Mr. Cloud is using the Little Kick Jihlava Association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not", he added.
American tradition permeates university life - freshmen can fly in a jet
We're delighted to be able to meet demand by launching the first luxury student travel service in Britain.
To make the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to haul their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We're excited to make sure that with our VIF (very important freshman) variants this year, students arrive at the university with the least amount of nervousness and the most luxury.
A company spokesperson said that since the service has only just launched, they have no reservations yet, but added: Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.
The company also stated that although students pay an annual tuition fee of £9,000, it expects the service to find a place in the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and desires - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF programme is exactly the right way to do that.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unreachable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, commented: For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to college, because the financial support available in the form of loans and grants can't keep up with the rising costs of basic necessities.
Feminists protest racism and police brutality after Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noticed a shift in online discussions among white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With rising tensions in the Midwest that have attracted national press attention, Perez has noticed that the response of white people is 100% race-centered.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the August 9th shooting, personal articles with headlines like "Thinking of a white woman over Ferguson" or "Feminism isn't just about women's oppression" appeared relatively late.
But Peres says it's a major change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privilege at that level", she declared.
People felt they had to speak out about what happened.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're facing because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially biased that they had to bring it up.
According to Corith Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson has brought to light the problems African-American women face every day that are not perceived as women's issues in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from people all over the world", Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colored being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
"How is it that a woman can talk about relationships in public but not about safety in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have been working on issues of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
She said that black women could not afford the luxury of sharing these problems openly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
While white women today are combining race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched, and the reason for almost all of them was the rape of a white woman, Hattery said.
You needed white people to help you justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the divide between whites and blacks came when suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or blacks.
"They decided to put the cards on women's suffrage and black suffrage to focus later", Hattery explained.
And if we realize that, we get an important insight into why black women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for them to organize against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for Lynching Prevention.
The group was formed 40 years after the first black women asked for help.
Mitchell says the outrage of white feminists' reactions to the issues that Ferguson brought - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with issues that black women had been struggling with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists in these [traditional feminism] spaces took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" Mitchell suggested.
The second wave of feminists, who have made a career of fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are now finding out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after the Michael Brown shooting attack to Facebook to post a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, demanding that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for perceiving danger in society - and views on race that differ markedly in opinion polls - will seek change", Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
Christina Sommers, an expert at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's comments on Ferguson's side face criticism that she has provoked before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a little program called My Brother's Keeper to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic people, it sparked an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between police and the black community isn't the only issue that's coming to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the southwest this year, the issue of reforming immigration laws has re-emerged - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to make the issue a women's necessity, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves", says Mercado.
Since most work permits are issued to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have resonance in women's organizations", she said.
Pig house for sale in Ipswich
The real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when they posted it, it had a pig resting on it in the living room.
A one-room detached house for sale at £120,000 stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The information photos included a picture of the living room where he rests with his head on a pig's couch.
Connells real estate said the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"The photo was accidentally found there, and has since been removed", the spokesman said.
In the property information, Connells' real estate office described the former prayer house as a "single, detached one-room house".
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the town of Harvey in the Southwest has a new millionaire.
The lottery player in Harvey wins a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, one lucky man takes home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw.
Traffic in Harvey has been lucky to split the money for the second time in five years, with the last one being a million-dollar win in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win was the talk of the town in southwest Perth.
It's the main topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was on the line.
Eight winners split a win in Western Australia last month, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, a couple from Belmont won a staggering $7.5 million.
The winning couple bet 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the 59th single winner of the Western Australian lottery this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains are not leaving tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL described the protest as a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose an off-peak time.
The GDL takes into account the many people who return from the weekend on the railway during the first working day.
We also think about the people who commute to work during the day", the union said in a press release on Monday morning announcing the strike.
'Our first strike should be primarily on freight, less on passengers,' added GDL.
DB has yet to release an official response to the strike.
It is also unclear how the protest will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in the wages of the drivers and a two-hour reduction in the working week.
Currently, the average salary of engine drivers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1,27 million crowns) per year depending on the years worked.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept a wage increase with a reduction in working hours.
They stress that the salary assessment of drivers must evolve in the same way as for other railway staff for whom the reduction of the working week does not count DB.
Krest's car was in danger of burning.
That's why he ended up at the Barum Rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't even think that something like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be repaired temporarily and then continued at a slower pace to the service station, where the mechanics could replace it?
If we headed straight for it, yeah.
But we had two more erzetes to go, and we couldn't.
It's very hot, and the risk of the car catching fire was high.
I can't afford that.
You've completed five speed tests at full speed.
What did they make you think?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, and I didn't drive over the windshield.
It was all because we had been tinkering with the car for over six months to get it to some level.
The race showed we did it.
You've made it so that you can think realistically about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so we could really win.
The work wasn't in vain.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of didn't come.
But that's Barumka.
Tech said no.
You weren't the only top-notch guy to drop out of the championship fight early.
It also dropped the foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many favorites have dropped out?
- I know.
It was a shame, especially for the spectators, because the race ended early.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you're about to give a ride, has been at the top for a long time.
But he paid for it by flying off the track and taking almost a two-minute gap.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could have repeated the winner's points.
He was the first to arrive.
But even Mira confirmed that we've got the car all set up.
He was going really fast.
Exactly one year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can the good feeling of riding make you a regular rally driver again?
Not at this point.
I said Barumka was my last race last year, and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to ride it again.
It was my 19th start here, and if I get a chance next year, I'll probably go for it.
But that's all I think about.
A lot of people got to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
We've been running for them to some extent.
A lot of people, known and unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's next for you after Barumca?
The team's moving on.
Next week we're going to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't damage the car too much.
Plus, he wants to borrow Fabio Honza Sykor for this race.
Me and Mira are in the European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for next year.
Can you give me any suggestions?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championship, you reached your maximum in the series with fifth place.
Don't you feel tempted to try the tracks again?
It's not attractive.
Oral agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not had a medical certificate issued, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform your duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately inform your employer of your absence.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was only verbal.
Although the Labour Code does not require the employer to confirm in writing his consent to the leave, this has proved successful in practice.
If it is only a verbal agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, as in your case, the alleged consent to take leave may be refused and absence from work may be considered as long-term unaccompanied absence, thus grounds for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
You are therefore missing substantial evidence in the event of a dispute with your employer.
Your employment was not terminated under Section 53, but you are listed on the invoice as an unjustified absence.
An unjustified absence from the balance sheet does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. inability to receive unemployment benefits), but it does make it more difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you see the doctor again and get a written confirmation that the accident that made you unable to work actually occurred (this is not a "no-puncture", it is just a doctor's certificate).
When you are looking for a new job, you can present this document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate the need to issue a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, to notify the employer promptly or to seek written consent for taking leave.
You can avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on the way back to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a short distance from the halfway mark of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the ground running for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172 and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car into the garage, didn't say anything to the reporters, and left.
His team boss, Chad Johnston, said the team of car 14 is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I wish we had a better performance and a better finish", Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we're doing better there.
Stewart hit the grid for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"We had hoped for a good finish in today's race", Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out".
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to go.
After his car hit and killed another driver at the New York City race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and he needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to make it to the top of the table.
He returned to racing during the investigation of a tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who crashed into Stewart's road during the race.
Authorities say the investigation into the cause of the crash will take at least another two weeks.
It's not decided yet whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received a warm cheer before the race.
Stewart started 12th, worked his way up to 10th at the start of the race, and then even to 4th.
Then, at the start of lap 122, Busch's car number
18 got out of control, went off the second corner and hit Stewart, sending both cars into a rollover.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st.
Prague has chosen a new taxi manager, will earn 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for a new taxi service manager.
The company earns around CZK 12.3 million per year from 103 parking spaces.
Until recently, the taxis charged the same number of seats a year.
This was reported by Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The city used to select its trustees by lot.
The winner then won the lease for a lump sum of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
At the moment, the bid is up to the bidder.
"A year after the termination of the original lease agreements and the launch of the tendering procedures, the new lease system has proven to be much more advantageous and fairer for Prague", the councilman says.
The most expensive spot is on the Pershing
The highest bid was for a place on the Pershing Street.
He'll pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxicab accommodation were adopted by the councils in the autumn of 2012 and the original lease contracts were terminated in the summer of last year.
The selection procedure was held in four waves and the new administrator found 29 positions.
This is the second time we've had to clean the well this year.
We let it all out every time, practically creating a second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured the Savo in.
The smell is unbelievable!
Our well in the basement always had plenty of wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't really a professional thing, Grandpa was just working it out.
It's been a long time.
It was only three screws and it was all the same, like everything else in the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
If she's been standing there for months, she deserves it.
But even then, we dreamed that the water didn't smell.
We were wondering if something fell.
In the place where the pump went, it was possible, with a little luck, the board was not quite sticking, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lit it up to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we improved the improvised sealing around the pump tube.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package on the floor with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a spotted mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where the vents, grandfather's invention, were fish remains!
And heavy to the bone!
Our basement is also a condo.
Some would say Grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just smothered sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
They're mostly boats.
And the wheels.
And a beach cot.
The wide-open door was usually open as someone walked in one step.
There are several of the aforementioned vents in the ceiling.
No nets, so birds usually fly in and build nests on the tracks.
No need to mention the mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fly, and it did.
Now, the air didn't help either.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned out the whole basement.
Especially the fish on the tram was nutritious!
We also threw away the things that were around: the planks, the Heraclite plate, and so on.
Our remote cabin greeted passersby with a disinfectant stove.
We were wondering who might have put the disgusting remains in there.
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She'd hardly come to our place for breakfast.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not all right.
Didn't he, that Franta, just put the disgusting stuff in there?
He's been here basically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to keep a watch on the basement and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, just for washing and rinsing until the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water from a forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
One day we heard a terrible, anxious barking of our fairy.
Mom looked out from the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass by the porch.
Reza was jumping over her and whistling like crazy.
Mom took it out because she thought Reza had dug up a garbage hose from the sink.
But then all of a sudden, the hose partly rolled into the club and partly straightened out.
The balcony was filled with sobs.
Reza has had a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
The lure, well over a meter long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Reza stopped her.
It was unclear whether she wanted to save the toad or eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the old lady saw the power in our family, she must have thought, "Let's eat her, since we're so hungry", and she went down to the basement.
We were flying to see her.
She jumped over the well like a lightning bolt.
By the way, we've recorded another stinking package on her record.
I think it's fishy.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a hassle.
And we locked the basement during the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we were, each taking a breath.
We didn't wait long.
It's a little bit of a mess behind the well.
First, there was a flat head with yellow moons on its neck.
Then the whole funnel went down to the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and started to get inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought the company laptops and sold them
A disgruntled employee bought computers from a company after being laid off and then sold them.
He spent the money he made before the police caught him.
In a short time, the man purchased a total of 16 computers in 12 cases for more than $200,000.
"After taking over, he took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them in the bazaars", said Rostislav Brückner, the chief commissioner of the Sumerian police.
The motive of the scams was to avenge the firing of the employer and also to gain money.
"He told us during interrogation that he used the money to pay off loans", Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudster is a pathological gambler who has been repeatedly treated in psychiatric hospitals.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money on him", said the commissioner.
A fraudster who was once convicted of theft now faces a prison term of one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether the bazaar will be punished for buying and selling the notebooks at a discount.
"It is true that they took over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious", the Commissioner said.
But none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged.
Come on, one more bit, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
The organizers have made some changes for us this year.
The biggest was the change in route, which brought the target to the swimming pool instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the booth where we took pictures and made videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I took on the role of personal guide.
My friend Katya and I obediently lined up at the end of the runway just before the start, for 60 to 70 minutes.
We greeted our friends who passed us in the fast-running sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A few warm-up jumps, turn on the sports test, countdown and start!
Cries of joy, but instead of a quick start, there was a hissing towards the starting line.
We're five minutes out, we're at the gate, I'm switching on the meter, and we're running at ten o'clock.
We're entangled with a yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, are running their first race.
Meanwhile, everyone looks fresh, the slowly setting sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost a glimpse of a dwarf.
Pulsating flesh rolling along the waterfront, it looks like the whole of Prague is running.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it's traditionally a showdown.
The light hill on Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or to walk.
Just before the run to the theater, I see a police escort and immediately behind him, Vítek Pavlišta is flying at an incredible speed to the finish.
I hear the admiring, mournful sighs of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's about to shake me, but just before that, my leg snaps and our hands are about to slip.
Running down Theatre Street gives you a chance to take a short rest and unwind.
It's necessary, there are places in front of us where the views take my breath away.
A turn on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I can't breathe, and my legs are almost carrying me.
After the first snack, there's a moment of truth.
When Katya is crossing the road, she slips over the curb and makes a swimming jump.
I see if she needs help, and I run a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It gets up and we continue down Goat Lane, it's one of the narrowest parts of the track, and at this stage of the race, there's not that much of a rush, but you still need to keep a good eye on the surroundings.
I don't know that the term narrowest place will take on its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, we are frantically encouraged by tourists and the friends of other runners.
I try to clap with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kate to do the same, because ten applause from the fans is like half a power bar.
It's working, we're accelerating again, and although we've fallen quite a bit, we're now in pursuit.
We are running ahead of dozens of runners, and when I pass someone who is particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, you can do it!"
No one's out of the way for the last snack, we're going to speed up.
We've been running for an hour and a half, adding up, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but you really have to push.
The sun has slowly set, and the day is symbolically ending slowly.
Last exit to the bridge, turn, and just the straight to the finish.
The pace we're running at, I wonder, where does that girl get it?
"Come on, we're going under the hour thirteen, we're working!" I call.
We try, we sprint, and there's a finish line.
One hour, thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can we do?
Coach set the limit at 20.
So seven minutes short.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Kat's legs break, and I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
You can see the exhaustion, but also the happiness of a well-done performance.
After a while, I'm slowly pulling her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't make us think about the pressure in the hallways of the locker room.
You can see here that Goat Lane wasn't the narrowest place.
That's right behind the finish line, which is under attack by nearly 10,000 runners packed to burst.
If you don't like crowds, this is no place for you.
I'm lost for a moment, too, wondering if the beautiful views and the more interesting route than in previous years were worth what was happening at the finish.
I know from experience that running a race is no fun.
If you add 10,000 people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire centre of Prague to all traffic, it's a huge challenge.
This year's change of route has shown runners many interesting places, but it has also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The exquisite atmosphere of the Yellow Baths was transmitted to the runners and to the race itself.
The organizers of the track and the casual spectators were grading it on every meter of track.
Unfortunately, there are obstacles to be overcome when running through the historic city centre, but I don't think that mass racing in a place with a wall on one side and a river on the other is the best solution.
If I say the race ended with a finish, I rate him as very accomplished.
I was a little concerned about the health of the participants at first, but it all worked out fine.
Write to us in the discussion, whether you liked the route and what you think about the situation at the destination.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria participated in a nationwide protest rally outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reinstatement of the original working conditions, which had recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov includes higher salaries.
For a month, the guards symbolically protested against the new work hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards' unions and the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"The negotiations are still ongoing", Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Employees' Trade Unions at the Ministry of Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison staff.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we can't see them?
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green at Columbia University got a hit in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe became the most accessible way for laypeople to penetrate the myriad problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - trying to unify two brilliantly working but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
The fundamental physics problem between the two key theories (because at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) was solved and solves so ingeniously that it is worth retelling even to the layman.
Greene, moreover, dealt with the complex material so freshly and so captivatingly that it is not his fault that he did not include many interesting things in his book.
Moreover, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, the author wouldn't mind if his book got outdated faster, but the fact is, 15 years later, Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important piece of theoretical physics.
It's quite likely that in the next few years, this area will be a little more alive (perhaps because the LHC will finally go full throttle), so it's a good time to enter Green's nonviolent open doors to the world of modern physics.
How big can our universe be?
The idea that our universe might have more than three spatial dimensions may sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and entirely acceptable.
To understand this, let's take a moment to look away from the universe as a whole and look at something more terrestrial, specifically the long, thin garden water pipe.
Imagine that you are pulling a 100-foot garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other, and you are watching the whole scene from a half-mile [0.5 km] distance (as shown in the picture and on the following page).
From that distance, you can easily see a long, horizontally stretched hose, but unless you are very sharp-sighted, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which to walk: left-right dimension along the hose.
If someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you can answer with just one thing: the distance between the ant and the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a half-mile away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we zoom in on everything, we suddenly see another dimension -- a circle around the hose.
In this magnified view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the tube, but also in the "in/against-the-clockwise dimension", i.e. around the circular section of the tube.
You're starting to understand that to determine the location of a tiny ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far away it is from the end of the tube and where it is on the circle that wraps the tube.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note that experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of strings.
Non-disruptive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
There is, however, a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the tube's circumference is short, "swirl" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the tubes at a much better resolution.
The above example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or small, curved and much less noticeable.
Of course, in this case, we didn't really go through the motions to reveal the dirty dimension of the tube thickness.
All you had to do was take a telescope.
But if the tube was thinner, like a hair or a capillary, we'd have to work really hard to find the fucking dimension.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his paper, in which he came up with the stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than the three dimensions we all know.
Kaluza reasoned his radical claim by saying that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
And the question immediately arises, how does this observation of Kaluz fit with the obvious fact that we're seeing exactly three dimensions of space?
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
That means that like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the tube, our universe has a large, vast, and easily visible three dimensions, whose existence we are aware of at every moment.
But analogous to the circular circuit of a garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, tightly wrapped in space so tiny that they have hitherto remained hidden from even our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a moment.
So imagine that we draw a fairly dense series of circles in black on the perimeter of the tube.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
And with the telescope, now, we're going to use the drawing to reveal the fucking dimension even more easily, because we're going to see the motif in figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension being large and almost infinite and the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but except for one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, which together make four spatial dimensions.
It's difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little bit, let's notice the illustration in Fig. 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In this image, we're zooming in on the geometry of the space in the same way that we zoomed in on the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth magnification level) if they're curled up in a small enough space; that explains why we haven't seen them directly yet.
The square grid represents the familiar "big" dimension, while the circular one represents the new, tiny, fuzzy dimension.
Just like the loops of thread in a tightly woven carpet, these circles exist everywhere in the usual dimensions - just for the sake of clarity, we've drawn them only in the intersections of a square grid.
The background of Figure 4 shows the familiar structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a grid of squares.
In each subsequent image, we focus on a small area of the previous image; we zoom in to make it visible.
At first, nothing unusual happens, as we see at the first few levels of magnification.
But if we go further on our journey of microscopic properties of the geometry of space -- to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 -- we suddenly see a new, circular, porous dimension, like the loops of thread in a tightly woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of the great dimensions, just as a tube has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we've drawn the circle dimension at just a few regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes the Kaluz and Klein idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, widely differing spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the tube has only one large dimension.
And the even more important difference is that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the extra circular dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize it - like the circular circumference of a tube - than to observe the obvious, large, and vast dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our most advanced magnification tools.
But most importantly, the extra dimension is not just a round bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three commonly extended dimensions.
It is the dimension independent of the other three dimensions, just as the dimensions top-down, left-right and front-back are independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data points, in addition to the usual three positions in the circular dimension; if we also count time, then five data points, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Interested in it?
You can buy Brian Greene's Elegant Universe at books.id today.
The price of the e-book is $49.
So to our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of only three dimensions of space, the Kaluz and Klein reasoning shows that this does not rule out the existence of additional curved dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most advanced technical equipment can recognize structures as large as a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
The smaller, twisted dimensions are barely observable.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension might be about one Planck length, far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Honnoutza Homola advises how to practice on the electric guitar: part 5.
The whole point of "twelve" is a 12-beat harmonic form that you can repeat at will.
For those who are interested in music theory, the principle is explained in detail here.
The first is the "Homolka" of the film "The Man Who Kicked the World".
The puppet master and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be found here, has been making a living as a graphic designer since graduating from high school 20 years ago.
He's the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which, unfortunately, he can't seem to leave.
He's a guitarist, after his father, as is his brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohnuts.
Start your training on one string.
"The rhythm pattern is up to you, you can come up with anything, just apply it to the harmonic pattern of the twelfth", advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honzo, what can be done with the twelve-string harmony on two strings and how nice it's starting to sound.
If you take the third string, you can flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, be careful of changing the tuning, Honza warns in the video.
Next time Honza comes back to the pentatonic, you try to put it together with the 12th.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you'll find out in an interview with Jan Homola at his first guitar school lesson here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, admits the Castle Dvorak
We take the point and we're happy for it.
We had more chances in the first half, second home", said the striker, who scored from a penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when he played, after all, he had a huge whistle?
I didn't notice much, though I think it would be worse on the other goal with the home fans.
You tied the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We slept through the opening, we were passive, it was a corner and then a penalty.
You got up after that, and you were a better team in the first half, with more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that after the score, we played well until the break.
In the booth, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game after it, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's also probably true that the hosts said something about the break to their game, that they weren't very happy with it.
You've scored your first goal on the opposing team's field, while you may not have scored a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's that different, but it's more about how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
Four games you've been waiting for a goal, you weren't worried that after the last game it might be the same?
I don't think so, but of course we're glad we don't have to listen to the talk of waiting for a goal since last game.
Now we've added more without waiting, but it's still three in six games, which isn't a big deal yet.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater a mile away.
Lava rising to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometre away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as is part of the underground lava tunnel mentioned.
This is the fact that is most troubling scientists now...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning.
2014) still spews out of the rift about the same amount of lava.
However, the quantity is lower than originally estimated, not 1000 m3, but 'only' 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption on August 29.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open up even where it is under the ice.
If this were to happen, and with the same intensity as the current eruptions, it would mean massive flooding, both in the Jökulsá á Fjöllum and in other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur around the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rising from the fissure.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also much more gas", says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with the area almost windless in the early morning hours.
The sandstorm's tracks were washed away by the rain.
The scientists can continue their work.
The air traffic is classified in orange (second highest) for Bárðarbunga and yellow (third) for Askju.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on wings
Flying day in Cheb.
On board the Boeing Stearman PT-17, air acrobat Peggy Walentin climbed out of the cockpit to the top of the twin-engine wing and between the wings.
There, she relies solely on muscle strength.
Cheb Air Day was held for the fifth time this year, and once again the organizers managed to prepare some interesting air pieces.
The premiere was held at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on wings" in the performance of the German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18.
He caught the eye with his glowing coat.
The acrobatic act called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to make it work.
But due to the high number of fatalities, it was banned.
But today, it's slowly returning to the air days schedule.
Peggy will be out of the cockpit on the upper wing after takeoff.
He's doing exercises there.
At the end of the performance, she moves into the space between the wings of the plane, where her show continues", said Luděk Matěček of the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the highlight of the program, then the next Mustang fighter performance was the cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter was raced on the surface with the Grippena of the Czech Army in the hangar (so-called on the numbers).
This was the first time that aviation fans had seen such a setup in the Czech Republic.
Pilot Miroslav Sazavsky then demonstrated to everyone a breathtaking stunt with a 1945 aircraft.
It was made during the war, but probably never saw combat.
He was in the Army Reserves.
He has been active in the civil service since 1963.
Even as a racing plane.
Today, he has his own hangar at Munich Airport.
In the same spot is another pearl of Cheb's aviation day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was a huge plane at the airport.
His polished aluminum traction shone far away.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force also won admiration.
A small transport plane flew in behind the abandoned Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof, Germany, for the flying day.
The German neighbors showed up at Cheb with reconstructed Yak 18T aircraft or a three-man formation of Bücker Jungmann biplanes.
A dramatic return to the camera!
Lucie Borhy has traded parental worries for work worries, at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde host obviously doesn't know any of that.
She was doing so well as a TV news anchor, as if she hadn't stopped seeing him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended the six weeks when women experience the most stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not be a regular on the TV Nova main news show.
She's not due back for a month, according to Blitz.cz.
Only her daughter Linda needs her more than the TV audience.
Lucie Borhy returned to the television screen and it was a complete and total disaster.
The exhibition next year in Prague?
The hall is sold out, he's planning a farewell party.
It would be dignified if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union views it", he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the impressive Nagano team met again.
Even the players who took part in the golden hat trick.
The players would like that, right?
I'm sure you will.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think you can find a day or two during the tournament when it's completely free and where you can mix it up.
We'll tell Gum or Béja Ščerban, who will take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
So if I come in like this...
You don't want to play for the national team.
Or did the July meeting change your mind in any way?
A representative and an exhibition match are two different things, and representation is about the decisive performances.
It's one thing for people to want to see me there, but performance is crucial, especially at the World Cup.
That's where players who can go, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagan encounter, anyway?
Just meeting the players was great.
You've brought stories to life and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience, not just for the fans, but for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and that we're leaving a generation that's really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimir Rózhička and Petr Čechmánek are on the alternate team.
Do you remember your first international match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames, and three young men, me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we started in a three-way.
It was the first start for all of them.
Well, we're dominating in some way, you can't say.
In Jihlava, after a long time, Dominik has caught Hasek.
What did you say about his performance?
I'm never surprised by Hasan on the ice.
I wanted to return the criticism, but I couldn't (Hashek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
Even Rusty did a great job.
And he was with me one night at practice, and he was a jerk.
And now he's got the big ones.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the football players start the qualification
The NH Hotel in Smichow was filled with prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, Chelsea goalkeeper Peter Cech, national coach Pavel Vrb...
And over there, the figure in the black scarf, that's Tomasz Rosický!
The Arsenal defender and captain arrived at the meeting around half past midnight, among the last.
We've got a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be excited?" he said, as he walked in front of the press in his representative suit.
Programme of the Czech representation
Monday, September 1: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday, September 2: Training is open to fans at 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday, September 3rd Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday, September 9 Czech Republic - Netherlands 20:45 Summer end of the meeting
Rosicki and his team can be supported by fans before Wednesday's game against the USA at 20:15.
The representative opened for them the training, which starts on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.
And then there will be an autograph, which neither Rosicky nor Čech will miss.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be more peaceful.
Which is a compliment from Coach Vrba, who just complained about the amount of social events in the spring.
We're finally gonna do what we want to do.
We'll focus on the Netherlands now.
It's an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that we haven't had so much time for", praised Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The national team has three matches under the Vork, all preparatory.
She drew 2-2 with Norway and Finland and lost 2-2 with Austria.
However, these results were not yet significant.
Not until now.
The match against the Netherlands will kick off the qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they could also manage the general against the USA.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about it to be successful", agreed Vrba.
The only player in the 23-man roster with health problems is striker David Lafata.
He's worried about his temperature.
If he doesn't recover for Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Vrba will call in another forward.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how she thought for years that she would die after a false diagnosis.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence believing that she had only a few years to live.
It was actually Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, sluggish walking and twisted toes.
People may also experience numbness or pain, which is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she had Freidreich ataxia, a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be confined to a wheelchair and dead by the time she was 30.
A mother of two, now 51, says: "As a child, I knew I could not do the same things as others.
Every day I fell, it took me longer.
I could never skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school for walking and running.
When Rodgers was 13 and had several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor had left the room and looked through her records to find out she had FA.
"I felt guilty for spying, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association", she says.
When they answered, I was in shock, I panicked.
I thought that by the time I was 18, I'd be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd be gradually losing all my abilities.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral.
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it's going to be something much less life-threatening.
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child", she declared.
The charity CMT UK has launched CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Washington-area businessmen: taxes will rise as the economy turns
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales, and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxation in a country with a fast-paced economic recovery rose slightly last year, and Washington businesses were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia collectively withdrew $27.6 billion to state and local treasuries in fiscal year 2013, a 3.8% increase from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - state and local - rose by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared with 3.9% last year, marking the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010 when taxes were cut.
According to a study by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political grouping Center on State Taxation, state taxes were rising faster, by 4.3%, than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from business taxes, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from corporations.
Virginia, at 28%, has the lowest relative tax rate on business.
The researchers argue that the majority of the tax revenue growth comes from the increase in the value of real estate owned by companies, which has increased property taxes by 3.7% this year for three consecutive years with growth of -1%.
While most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, the same seems to be the case in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012, a year-on-year increase of 4.2 percent.
However, the apparent increase in real estate value does not drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property taxes account for nearly half of all state and local taxes.
"Maryland is home to a lot of real estate owned by corporations, especially tax-paying entities in the D.C. area, the government or nonprofits that don't pay taxes", explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, say, income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
The data also show that business income is increasing.
Companies in the region have filed a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing at the same rate in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was on par with the national average, at 4.3%, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the tax increase below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of all three counties (all of which have the same tax rates) at 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high at 9.975%.
A similar study this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a more favorable tax climate overall than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces competition from the South.
North Carolina recently signed a bill lowering the corporate tax rate from 6.9% to 6%, and so does Virginia, and next year it's going to be 5%.
If the State continues to meet its revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small business owners in Washington are doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
The living wage tax paid by small business owners as a personal income tax -- the cost-offsetting structure of rising prices that most businesses are organized on -- in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the impact of the measures on the profitability of the Union industry.
But Washington may be lagging behind the rest, because cutting government spending is taxing its labor market.
What you missed: Tusk will be the boss of Europe, Putin's Novorossiya and Lafat's scissors
Is there going to be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for talks on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken of the possibility of a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have been fighting pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned that European companies would have difficulty returning to the Russian market following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions.
He has also been involved in the creation of the 'Russian People's Republic'.
He says that the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he can't say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Another sanction for Russia?
The Czech Republic has invoked the right to disagree with the
The European Commission is to propose, with diplomats, a form of further sanctions against Russia within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
This was stated by the Permanent Chairman of the EU's meetings, Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for a shift in the form of sanctions are to be ready as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye will replace him in December.
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected President of the European Council, the so-called EU President who chairs the summits of the member states.
He's replacing Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
The head of European diplomacy is Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, who replaces Catherine Ashton.
Italy, who will thus become the future Vice-President of the European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament in office.
Assisted dying is a reality in the Czech Republic, but it's not talked about.
Help an incurable and long-suffering patient with a terminal illness?
In the Czech Republic, where the law does not allow euthanasia, it is not legal.
Yet, the doctors who spoke to LN said they heard about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter in neurology, says the doctor on sclerosis
In the Czech Republic, about 300 people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 21 patients are undergoing experimental stem cell treatment at the Prague Motel.
We don't know 100% if she'll be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't know", says Radim Mazanec, a neurologist at Motol.
It's about knowing the CIA's handwriting, they needed the war, writes Huml about the downing of flight MH17
The MP for the CIS, Stanislav Huml, has a clear idea of who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
He said it was clear that "the harsh sanctions imposed in connection with the downing of a civilian plane with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian military".
The lawmaker says it's a bonus to know the CIA's handwriting.
Promises that cannot be kept.
With the election coming up, the parties are again offering the impossible.
No more homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car over Prague.
It's the same thing every election: parties promise the impossible.
Now, with the municipal elections coming up, politicians are also racing to see who the voters will like the most.
The server of Lidovky.cz has selected unfulfilling promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
The siege is in full swing
It was 30 August 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, was constantly asking for technical equipment and to send it to the front.
The British eventually complied and included this ground unit as one of their forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the hands of German troops.
Plzeň leads the league ahead of Prague "S", Liberec declassified Baník
Viktoria Pilzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading by one point ahead of both Prague "S".
The changes at the top of the table were caused by the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslava.
After two defeats in the domestic league, Sparta recovered, thanks to two strikes by Lafat, defeating the Jablonec.
The record for the year was won by Liberec, who shot Ostrava's Minik 6-0.
62,000 people watching volleyball?
The Poles say yes
The opening of the volleyball World Cup in Warsaw brought a record attendance.
A football stadium under a covered roof was packed with 62,000 spectators watching the home team's smooth win over Serbia.
Tickets sold out in 100 minutes.
How do you survive a return from vacation?
Take your time and get some sleep.
The last days of the holiday are ahead of us.
Getting used to the normal pace of work after returning from a sunny beach or cabin can be difficult for many nuts.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven ways to cope with the change: slow down and get a good night's sleep.
Family of Joan Rivers: "Holding our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter expressed today that she does not lose hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her thumbs.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency room that she had a cardiac arrest at Yorkville Endoscopy on the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors are deliberately keeping her sedated and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains serious.
The reaction was quick, including incredible online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is the twisted headline
The fact that the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more aptly called annoyance.
This is particularly true of articles on the Israeli-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.
It's common to hear headlines like "Israel attacked Gaza".
Only in the text do you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often during the declared ceasefire.
That's when the headline comes up, "Both sides violated the ceasefire".
Does the press community realize that by doing so it is directly contributing to the growing anti-Semitic attitudes across Europe (and beyond)?
It's been less than 60 years since World War II ended.
There are still people who survived the Sho.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany where the crowd was shouting "Jewish pig" and similar slurs, I was blown away.
Is the world trying to complete what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, they were destined to wipe out the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care in your work.
You've often been called the "watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
While he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to liquidate the Czech nation and wipe the Czech Republic off the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also realize one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're happy there.
If you ask them why they don't go among "their" like to Gaza, they'll tell you why they would do it.
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-notch health care (I have seen firsthand how the top-notch private hospital Hadassah, which is funded by donations from Jews from all over the world, is also frequented by Arabs and, of course, is used for treatment).
Hamas is also firing at its Arab brothers.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus this troubled area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not condemning Israel, even if it's in the headlines.
Inform them of Hamas' practices, of their use of people as human shields.
Inform them that Hamas is determined to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Inform them that Hamas is on the list of the world's terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could be flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, which the Gaza administrators do not pay for and are even angry that the power supply is interrupted at times during this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in building underground tunnels for suicide bombers to penetrate into Israeli territory, but rather in building housing, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON just confirmed Monday morning's news: An online retailer - a producer of videos and hundreds of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement was a surprise, not because nobody expected anyone to buy Twitch, but because they expected YouTube to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the billion dollar sale of Twitch to Google seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, was set to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream games online - in the words of Business Insider, "YouTube for live gaming".
The Twitch interface.
There are already popular videos on YouTube called "Let's play", where the "motherfuckers" (mostly the older ones) give the games a Mystery Science Theater treatment.
The fact is, YouTube is a lot of a shock to the world when it comes to describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn't really get anyone excited, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn't work, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at the moment is the words of Emmet Shear, CEO of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, they share the same values and long-term vision, and they want to help us achieve it faster".
Another mystery is, quite frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they'd rather do sports than watch, it's hard to understand what's so great about watching games instead of actually playing them.
It's one thing to watch a friend over your shoulder at 3:00 a.m. playing Resident Evil, and it's another to watch a stranger get 20 blows to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a sore throat.
I admit that speed run games, where Roger Bannisters of the electronic age finish the game in record time, are fun.
But unless someone is a master of acting or humor, their Twitch channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do they know about a skeptic like me?
Twitch has 55 million monthly hits and is the fourth most visited website on the Internet.
How exactly is Amazon going to use it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something every company wants to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As the CEO of Twitch Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch believe in the future of gaming, and the media doesn't seem to be reluctant, even as - swallow - viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time, the theme is "The Holy Scriptures - God's Word".
Original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, we are often confronted with the question, Who will you believe?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
As if human research were nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "human", they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God", they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then he is the one who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and he must be the one who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and he must be the one who added the other set of evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion down to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It's like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans couldn't have created any of these things.
But people can tell stories, they can make stories.
And it was men who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every so-called sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
By people who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by none other than mere mortals with a certain amount of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the one holy scripture.
It would be known all over the world, without precedent, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors could not compete with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, backed by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal a deep morality and wisdom that far exceeds all human limits.
It would forever inspire every reader to unite in common faith.
If it were written by God, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of one religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, all of them constantly breaking up into more and more separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, each claiming somehow divine guidance, despite continuing disunity and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian gospels, the Islamic Koran, the Kitáb-i-Akdas of Bahá'u'lláh, the Avesta of Zarathustra, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Urantia Book are all considered to be "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true God", and the faithful of each are told that the others are in error.
The only logical explanation is probably that to some extent everyone is wrong.
None of the above books has any advantage over the others.
None of them are supported by evidence, and none of them are historically verifiable.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologetics, because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true that have been overcome.
So they cannot be said to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with each one possibly containing prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more like a mutual commentary.
We have to point out again that we have two different authors here whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author, and it is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, the five Books of "Moses", and do not attribute to Moses the authorship of any of them, since he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Scholars agree that Genesis was compiled (probably by Ezra) from several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time, and they're all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished basis for all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docty and the Ebionites and their very different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into some kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by further Bible revision.
One of these modifications relates to a king of Ugarit who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Mossical religion, the New Testament writers decided to ridicule and change Baal Zebub, the "Lord of the Mountains", to Beelzebub, the "Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible has been deliberately and subtly altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions at the Council of Nicaea.
Four Gospels were accepted, and 16 others were rejected by a simple wave of the hand, as if the facts of a matter could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem church?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon thus evolved from the very core of the early church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also deliberately took away more than ten books of the Bible, even though the books that were approved referred to them.
Among the rejected items are writings of both apostles and prophets.
Why should we refer to books that are just words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God was the real author of this random mixture of legend, proverb, and psalm lyric?
The Bible was certainly written by men, and certainly not by enlightened men, but rather by men!
That's why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, regardless of what it is from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, they believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand to spray blood on someone, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and they thought it was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows the stripe patterns, they would give birth to stripe calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
The authors of this book did not know that, of course.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it fails utterly because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or encouraged cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
To justify their inhumanity by claiming to be doing God's will.
But creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any facts are contrary to the Bible, then the facts must be ignored!
Why? Why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, it's the same thing.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshiping the creation rather than the Creator".
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the falsification of their supposedly "holy" books somehow falsifies God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationists think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where the believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God himself because they think they are his word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that men approved or rejected in their supposed "unchangeable word" of any god was invented, composed, compiled, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also deliberately altered and distorted by mere erring men.

Chinese school attacker stabs nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to New China, broke into the elementary school building this morning and attacked around 11:30 local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later committed suicide by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks on schools and children.
The public is therefore calling for greater safety measures and better protection for children in a country where many couples have only one child in accordance with government policy.

The new art director of Newsweek is David Fiala.
The new art director of news and publicity for Nova TV has been David Fiala since September 1.
He succeeds Alan Zarub, who has been head of the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of Z1 News Television.
In the last two years, under the direction of Alan Zaruby, he participated in the realization of a complete visual transformation of the newscasts Televiziony Noviny, Střepiny, Prašek! and other publicist programs of Nova TV.
David Fiala has a very good command of the synergy of communication between the editorial, studio management and the graphics department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the way we want to continue to go in Nova's visual news", says Nova's creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, nude photos of celebrities leaked
Screenshot of the leaked files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on 4chan has been posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, Mashable.com has reported.
It was allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where disabled users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not commented on the problem.
Some celebrities dismiss the images as fake, but several have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Deadly Trap 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use the images and videos he gets to enrich himself.
The footage was reportedly picked up by a US magazine, according to a report on 4chan, but the hacker prefers to get money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it's very likely that this is indeed an iCloud security vulnerability.
A tool that allowed us to get passwords to user accounts through brute force, that is, automatically repeating log-in attempts with different passwords, appeared on GitHub two days ago.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was released.
In addition, the Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a significant number of such transactions.

The leak of nude photos of celebrities should be seen as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers from companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times more secure than computers in homes or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is a risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also sensible to set the automatic backup of photos from the phone to run only on Wi-Fi and when connected to a charger.
This will allow you to move sensitive images to a safe location in time, and more importantly, you will have space to delete unwanted images so they don't take up unnecessary space in your online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communications on the Internet are offered to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valašek in PDF format.
A smart way to save for college scripts
Since the cost of a college script for many students is over $1,000 a year, the incoming sophomore came up with a clever way to cut costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from his senior classmates with the offer of nominal compensation to delay their resale.
"I got a calculator, which normally costs $180, for ten and a chicken nugget for a semester", says Schroeder, 19, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books he needed for his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have various options for managing these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder's are becoming the preferred choice of students.
The lending of textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 on-campus bookstores, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in response shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring semester, says Neebo vice president Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of textbooks are bought in college bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Some new books can be as much as a third cheaper online than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book Calculus by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but you can buy a new one online at Chegg.com, a bookstore specializing in textbooks, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's comments or wear and tear, textbooks are a good option.
Calculus is on sale at $93.49 on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business.
New one was selling for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes aren't essential to the work in the seminaries.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, a popular alternative to buying used books is eBay Inc's Half.com.
Lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, provided you handle them well, remember to return them, and do not need to keep them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow Calculus for about $20 for a full semester.
Read the terms and conditions of the store where you borrow the book, including penalties for annotations, highlighting or wear and tear, and damage.
Note: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a regular book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of a durable electronic license from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg is lending Calculus for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the best deals can be found by students of literary courses, since many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who's about to enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN, because it ensures you're buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it's actually in stock, advises Gault.
He saw it for himself.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found a torso of rifles from the end of the war in the well
The well is near St. George's Church.
We discovered a growth around it and began to pull out a mature litter - about three feet [1.5 m] of mud and decaying leaves.
When we approached the clay bottom, we hit a warhead", Radomil Novák told the newspaper.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found it to be the torso of a German assault rifle used by the SS.
The find is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, these rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them", Novák added.
All the wooden construction stuff has decomposed over time, so it's useless.
Her body, however, is preserved - it retains its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There's one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably out of fear of being pushed out.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing their guns in the woods", the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the Autumn Ghost Movement enthusiasts found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them everywhere, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully sifted through the mud to avoid any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there", Novák said.
The find ends up in the museum depository at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released the captured Czech
Exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who is freeing Ukrainian soldiers from captivity by pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take this... they're calling me from Donetsk", Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, also director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, apologized eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they are - or should be - that Ruban was specifying with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there", he ended one of his flashy discussions with Donetsk and turned to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests in Maidan.
Yesterday, when we were talking, he was in Donetsk.
He's been working 24 hours a day to free Ukrainian soldiers from the hands of pro-Russian separatists.
You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to be 30.
There could be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already freed the captured Serbs, Dagestanians, Chechens, one Swede, a Georgian... but not yet the Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captive compatriot and we can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
AC: What advice do you give to Czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian troops?
They should understand that if they fight in the Ukrainian volunteer battalions like the Czechs and the separatists capture them, they will be shot at mercilessly after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The Separatists consider these men mercenaries and they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - including perhaps a Czech - they will put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna live.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
AS: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to rescue so far?
If I understand correctly, it's a trade.
Some sources say it's long past the hundred.
We stopped counting how many people we helped a long time ago.
We only freed them... not saved them from war if they choose to continue fighting.
The rescuers are doctors, surgeons, but we're not.
That's the way it is.
And every day, more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be a trade.
Sometimes a simple human request is enough to release a prisoner.
AC: Rumor has it that in a few months you have gained a lot of authority and even trust among pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect on both sides of the war?
That's a tough one.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the crazy general with the steel balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that sums up the nature of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Corps of Officers, I've earned some authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I'm acting honestly and telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I just tell them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... this job could be over for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long squeeze)... to torture prisoners in interrogations resorted to Ukrainians and separatists.
I'm sorry about that.
And the executions?
They only happen on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also reforming prisoners.
No sign of the Ukrainian military doing anything like this.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and don't want to give the numbers.
AS: Describe the character and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
They're officers, but they're also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying to achieve independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their uncompromising opponents - for life and death.
As we say, they ate them to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were expressed by people at the Maidan, by the way.
And now I'm speculating a little bit: Russia is supporting the separatists and the West is supporting the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other to be small.
But there is an irreconcilable contradiction in my own sentence.
AC: For example, how do you feel about one of the most hard-line leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the front lines, I am unarmed and show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I'm always on either side of those two hundred or three hundred meters on a bullet or in an optical sight.
I can always see the faces of the people who are pointing at me... and they can pull the trigger at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, only as a small province in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, he keeps talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some sort of misunderstanding.
He said there shouldn't be a state like this.
He is also the implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
AS: Speaking of characters - in a Ukrainian TV talk show you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
I'm always scared five times on that 300-meter walk.
Why should I hide the idea that Jacek is a very weak prime minister and that he is harmful to our country?
AC: Do you think he was involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians nickname Jacek "rabbit".
And the rabbit is not an animal to be feared or to be respected and held in authority by others in the eyes of the Ukrainians.
His behavior is a direct copy of the rabbit's.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister in war he has no right to cry in parliament, beg him, play with his schemes, threaten to resign... he must run the country, run it and protect it in wartime.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister has no right to family, friends, rest for mourning emotions.
He's the first minister of Ukraine.
What about Jacek?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he doesn't fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save the Box Office
Sylvester Stallone's The Replacement 3 returned less than $30 million on a $90 million budget in the U.S. and Sin City: A Woman I Would Kill for returned only $12 million on a $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz sex tape only made $14.6 million in its opening weekend, and children's movies like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were disappointing.
According to film critic Robbie Collin's article in the Telegraph, when it comes to children's films, the fault lies in the quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year for children's films, and How to Train Your Dragon 2 he called a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films aimed at a slightly older target audience, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer movie premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between War Vampire Day and July 20 in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of the audience and the film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
Some commentators say that the change in viewership and the increased popularity of internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing".
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what's already been.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood blockbusters, Netflix's net profit from internet services reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book rights, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the potential for big box office hits in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Outsiders and Jurassic World, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply "cyclical", telling the Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest box office summer in history, and nobody will worry about sales".
The DPRK is threatening Seoul again, has launched another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul has announced.
The missile test was conducted shortly after the end of joint US-South Korean military exercises, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for an invasion.
Changang Province is located in the northwest of the DPRK, bordering China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Defense, according to DPA, said the missiles were fired from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and had reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea may have fired its first missile from Chang'an province, South Korean media reported, citing military sources.
There's an underground launch pad for Scud missiles in the province.
This is the latest in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Protests against the NATO summit in Newport over the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for what was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough was following the situation over the weekend and talking to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by a plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went for a hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on a Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, worried relatives called the police at about 8:00 p.m.
A search party was dispatched, including local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The police stayed with them overnight and picked them up Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital by ambulance in stable condition.
Olomouc brought back a point from Opava, the winner was on your leg
The 23-year-old forward could have made the decision, but he failed in two big chances.
She called for the goal, mainly shooting close three minutes before the end, instead of in the net but ended up on Opava's goalkeeper Josef Kvetony.
I had it on my leg, I have to give that chance.
I'm mad at myself", your little man poured ash over his head.
"I should have put it higher under the lid, I got a little sick", he mused.
Sigma's defense didn't give Oppa much, except for Mikul's attack in the 11th minute, which was covered by Reichl.
Then the Hanas started to push, but they didn't let them in the block defending the house and the shells were caught from a distance by Květenny.
We've been competing for 15 minutes, then we've taken the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava was only threatening us from standard situations.
But Vasiček didn't change the odds, and it ended 0:0", said coach Leos Kalvod.
The opponent also took a point due to the absences in the squad, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vavřík with three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík, who are guests of Sigma in Silesia, were also missing.
Unlike its previous policies, it did not allow them to enter.
The substitutes deserve to be discharged.
Sigma looked more footballing, but we didn't let it do anything except one standard", said Slezan coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent win for us", he added.
Sigma has a four-point lead, which puts them in 13th place.
Nothing that would satisfy the club boss, Josef Lebro, who, after losing to Znojmo, conditioned his million-dollar contribution to the treasury on diametrically different performances in subsequent matches.
"We have taken Mr. Leber's warning into account, so there can be no question that the boys would not want to fight", noted Kalvoda, adding to the sleeping shooter: "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall.
But after the first hit, I'll replace him immediately so he can save goals for the next games", laughed Kalvoda.
Al Pacino has been a Venice enthusiast twice.
The film festival is in crisis
After the huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Inarritu was suddenly among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days gave the impression that interest in the 71st Venice Film Festival had somewhat declined.
Whether it was because the seating capacity of the largest theater had increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films like the 1960s Indonesian genocide documentary The Silence of the Lambs and other social-themed films from America's 99 Homes to Iran's Tales, theaters were simply left empty.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been crowded as before, and it is said that it is no longer a problem to get a last-minute hotel seat.
The crisis is the most talked about in Italy, and it is no wonder that it has affected such a prestigious institution as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not characterized by a lack of personalities, but by a lack of personalities who are present exclusively in the context of films.
While younger fans longed for autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully landed dramatic roles in a total of 99 homes, for all generations without distinction, the main event became the visit of legendary actor Al Pacin.
He's been in two movies.
In the out-of-competition story "Prosperity", directed by Oscar-winning director Barry Levison, based on the novel by Philip Roth, Pacino, 74, plays a role that is close to his heart: an actor at the height of his fame, suffering from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him the next day as the strange iron-man from the small country town in the film Manglehorn, directed by David Gordon Green, was truly an unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Performance by an Actor should not be missed - but does an artist of Pacino's format need awards?
Perhaps his greatest satisfaction is the love of the public, and the Italian in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly proclaims the country his grandparents came from.
Points for Italy
And, by the way, Italian cinema is doing very well in Venice this year.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film since Birdman to be rewarded with a long standing ovation.
It looks at the Calabrian branch of the mafia through the family ties between clans that fight for power and money, and the director has managed to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a good script, camera, music and actors.
He also captured the chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which starred Saverio Costanzo and Alba Rohrwacher as a woman whose misguided anxiety nearly kills her own child.
In contrast, neither The Ransom of Fame nor 3 Hearts, both of which are based on the traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of actors, were warmly received by the French competing films.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so small for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival footage is all about depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy shown in Venice out of competition and shot in the style of the American comedians of the 1940s, managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police in Prague caught four pervitin manufacturers, bringing drugs from Poland
"Detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman in the past few days who manufactured and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9 from November last year until August this year", police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the task force in Cihlářská Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who figured in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a saleswoman.
The next day, with the prior consent of the prosecutor, detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man.
The last of the four was caught by police in the early hours of Wednesday, August 20 at the Malaysian incineration plant", the spokesman described.
For the transport of drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drugs.
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the workshop of the summer camp, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvová Street and at other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, provided various tools and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of pseudoephedrine medicines from the Republic of Poland.
He would then weigh the drugs produced, break them into plastic bags, and sell the pervitin.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman, who had never been punished, to transport drugs from Poland or sell them to drug addicts.
For this, she was paid a reward of one third of the drugs produced by the organiser", Rössler added.
The criminals also conducted several home searches on the orders of the judge, where they seized drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubes and other tools and items that, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995
"From the records available, the police found that the main organiser had been convicted of property crime seven times since 1995, and the woman had not been convicted", the police spokesman added.
The last person detained was convicted on probation in 2006 for the crime of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old auto mechanic, who is on parole, has been convicted nine times since 2009.
He was mostly for property crimes.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with the crime of illicit manufacture and other dealings with narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
The prosecutor finally filed a motion for detention for three persons, which the judge eventually placed them in", the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, has been released.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wood and carbon chess.
Ferrari offers very interesting things at very "interesting" prices as part of its other products.
A good example is the handmade chessboard in Italy, with a size of 42 x 42 centimeters.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer receives a set of black and red-painted wooden figurines stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibre.
It probably comes as no surprise that instead of the classic rider, players have a figure of a horse rising.
If chess doesn't seem like a worthy enough gift, there's also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (handmade, of course) at a 1:1-8 scale.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Cancelling middle and high schools doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few people with general education, and statistics show that high school students are well-trained.
The start of the school year is here.
The schools have been preparing for the last fortnight.
Mostly it's routine stuff, like bringing the flower beds from the summer storage back to the classroom and blowing chalk.
They're gonna have a little more trouble at Mountain High.
A few days before the season starts, they pick up furniture, computers, and other technical equipment and literature from the library.
No robbery or embezzlement, four-year gymnasium in Hořicí after three years opens and restores its activity.
Not on a public platform, but on a private one.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the inability of the founders.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by its inclusion in the register of schools administered by the MŠMT.
"The French Socialists should shut up and put France in order", says key ally Francois Hollande
Valls calls on the deeply fragmented left to show its support for a combative socialist president whose new division of office has not been met with the approval of the majority of French people.
The president deserves the respect of the entire world, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side", he said, and applauded.
In a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France's controversial 35-hour workweek, despite passionate speculation from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who earlier this week proposed relaxing the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande urged the Socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, crossed the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for making the French lose faith in the future.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme right-wing conservatives, laughed at the constant internal strife among the socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
The Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and so is Prince Manuel Valls, who were forced to form a new government when the previous one failed to last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter", Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that the party could win the snap election and that she was ready to run the country.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the far-right won the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the weekly Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before the end of Holland's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there is a change in the situation", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art no longer limit Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
No more games will disappear from Prague's streets before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on dog walking.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in the parliamentary elections in October.
"Moreover, the decision to change should not be taken by the current city leadership, whose mandate ends in a few weeks", said councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several municipalities, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling in their territory in recent weeks.
The gambling laws are not going to change.
It's the task of the new city manager after the election.
Now we wouldn't even be able to do it technically, given, for example, deadlines for submission of comments and the like,' explained Manhart.
He added that the last meeting of the current legislature, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a ban on gambling is being held on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, gambling is prohibited, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons for street art, so-called busking.
The complaint was lodged in particular by Prague 1, which has already sent the Magistrates' Office a proposal for places to be added to the current list of prohibited places.
Prague 5 doesn't want musicians around Angel either.
The city has been working on a dog-walking ordinance for months, and it's not finished yet.
The location of the hernia and the issue of busking are dealt with by city ordinances.
They may be issued or amended only by the representative office of the capital.
The councillors have only a consultative vote, they cannot issue decrees themselves.
Last week he put the victory of the Scottish independence movement within reach.
The Scottish Independence Campaign was in danger of making that mistake a third time by nearly putting up billboards all over Scotland asking whether Scots wanted to be rich.
But you won't win the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you win their respect by threatening them.
The New Testament morality is still alive in Scotland, even though few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots are far more inclined to kick the money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The leader of the Scottish Nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this well, and so he repeatedly asked his rival, the unionist Darling, in a televised debate whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if the Scottish voters voted for independence and began to support a single currency for Scotland and England.
It forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London's financiers, and he fell into that trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate.
However, the discussion about what Scotland's currency would be has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the protection of public health that citizens get for free.
Darling has supported the London bankers on the currency issue and has also given the impression that he will not protest against the privatisation of healthcare.
By, as Salmond put it, "getting into bed with conservatives".
That's a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to the voters, but to the Association of the "Bosses", the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he's saying is clear: Scots must not jump and accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
The pessimistic beginning of the school according to Milos Urban

Milos Urban Longest year
The end of the holiday was the best, the last week of nowhere, just hanging out and hanging out with the ladies in the summer, the calm before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes, if you can get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, 50 years old, riding a bike up the mountain around the Imperial all the way back to Varese, somewhere near the tennis courts, it wasn't hot anymore, the sun was rubbing my back and shoulders, knocking my rays to say goodbye.
Mild nervousness in the evening, still on holiday, sleeping until half past eleven, worse in a week, the moments before bedtime stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then waking up at half past seven in the morning.
He's coming in on Monday.
It doesn't usually rain, but instead, summer is a vicious one in front of the school.
Gliding into a ghostly light on a shelf and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass pencil, there's this school, ZDHS.
A West Valley with a monstrously pink patch, and in front of it, old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more outstanding, girls more boobs.
There are the scumbags, the ones to avoid, but it's interesting how they're holding together so unerringly and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came in screaming, they're laughing hysterically at something, and I think something's changed in their lives over the holidays, whereas everything's the same with me.
And the new freshmen, some nervous and other excitement, why are they even here?
Because they must, military education compulsory.
So, inside, the cold dampness of the floor and the slight smell of disinfectant, the poisoned moped schoolyard, unfortunately still the same one that is supposed to lend the student the keys to the tin cabinet where you can leave the textbooks, which are still so scarce.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room is a memory, it's not happening now, it's nice and airy, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
Just thinking about it makes my stomach cramp and my head start to hurt.
A head that has a worse grasp of the mathematics of the devil's game for the chosen, of which I am not and never will be a part.
And the three-fourers, the goddamn fifers, hiding from the test, fitting in the bench and getting the best out of it, being there and not being there, just existing as a name in the classroom and dreaming about stories of nicer girls and pretty buildings, antennas into space, where nobody competes with anybody, humiliates anybody, and puts a foot on anybody's foot.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day one, now like years ago.
She left her newborn daughters to die.
She is facing an exceptional sentence.
The first delivery took place in March 2012 in a public toilet booth at a bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, she gave birth to a baby girl, who she wrapped in a prepared blanket after she had her umbilical cord cut, hid under her jacket, and carried to a roadside shed, where she laid her down in the bushes a few hundred feet off the road.
She gave birth on the way to school.
I think I figured it out a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom on the bus, I gave birth there.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut my umbilical cord with scissors I wore to school", the defendant described, saying she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day, she returned to the scene, put the baby's body in a bag and took it away, took the body out of the bag, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs at her grandmother's house in Havlíčková Brod", the lawsuit states, noting that it is not entirely clear when the newborn died.
It could be within a few minutes, or even hours after delivery, choking while covering a blanket or putting it under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
The same scenario was repeated the following spring.
A woman in the near unknown period from February to April 12, when the body of the child was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havlíčekobrodsko, again gave birth in secret.
This time in the bathroom of the penthouse in the family home.
Without checking that the baby was alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic bags, including a plastic bag, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, her boyfriend gave her up.
The father of the two children was a friend of the defendant's, who allegedly did not know about the partner's pregnancies.
For that reason, he is not on trial, only punished for his offense against the Funeral Ordinance.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the baby against my wishes.
I know my solution was not right, but it seemed human at the time", said the defendant, who was reportedly in a relationship with a man who was submissive and afraid of him.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke rather calmly.
Tears came to her eyes as she spoke of her relationship with her parents, whom she had left when she was an adult.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it", she exclaimed.
I didn't buy the equipment because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I was gonna put it in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain it to you", she said when the judge asked her.
She refused to act with intent and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, she claims, was born dead.
But she didn't stop drinking alcohol even while she was pregnant.
I did, though.
And he didn't drink hard.
I also cut down on smoking", she said.
Although she was pregnant in both cases, she told everyone and repeatedly told everyone that she had a medical condition, that she was dehydrated.
And a friend too.
The main proceedings will continue at the courthouse on Tuesday with the testimony of the forensic experts.
A verdict could be reached by Wednesday.
The woman faces a maximum sentence of 18 years in prison, or an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third largest cruise ship operator in the world, has advanced in negotiations to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The transaction would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion that competes with larger competitors Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), access to luxury cruise ships owned by Prestige Cruises and wealthy customers.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, a source said on Sunday, but cautioned that the talks may not yet be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because the meetings are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, and a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported sales of USD 1,2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
The 29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
The companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007 following the closing of the $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its present form since 2000, when it merged with cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the regulatory registration at the end of June, Genting held a 28%, Apollo 20% and TPG Capital LP 8% equity stake.
According to the registration documentation of the first public offer, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 % of the North American passenger volume.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities the day after the vote decision
Nearby stood a group of Beijing loyalists waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates would contest the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first gain the support of the nominating committee, which will likely be made up of members loyal to Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for the opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democracy activists to renew their pledge to cripple the financial center of Hong Kong's Occupy Central protest movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, with Chinese leaders worried that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report in June outlining Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on special administrative district elections and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city's business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Premier Li, is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open talks with eastern Ukraine on state sovereignty
According to a Russian newspaper account, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the state sovereignty of the breakaway areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin's comment did not mean that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking area would be given the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals is consistent with the obvious strategy it has been following since the outbreak of the unrest five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorussia de facto independence so that it can join Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state television channel One, Putin condemned Ukrainian military action to retake the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported Putin's words that anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon is a prisoner of illusion, because Ukrainian politicians have launched a campaign ahead of the parliamentary elections on October 26 while government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-held areas.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must start meaningful negotiations immediately, not only on legal issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the status of the state sovereignty of the south-east of Ukraine", he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed with the Kiev leadership for several months and is intended to ease concerns of Russian-speaking areas about the threat to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy could only be granted to the eastern regions by the Ukrainian government.
This is not a matter for negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The Kremlin spokesman's intervention, which was intended to correct a "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks, highlighted the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty in annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and opinion polls conducted even before the conflict showed broad support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have negotiated in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main naval fleet, a maritime trading base, and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov, Russia, and Crimea are also the hub of mines, factories and smelters that produce important components for the Russian military.
During his June 7 inauguration speech, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers consider changes to the constitution after new elections that would give the various regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from the Kremlin and the separatists, who accuse Moscow of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals follows a further advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to take strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a 500,000-person metalworking port between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching a point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks on Ukrainian territory.
The EU Summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaysk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The photo-sharing scandal has implicated Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online in the biggest celebrity photo-hacking scandal in history.
The hacker claims to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The leak also allegedly leaked personal photos of Australian actresses Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential magazine: "It's disgusting".
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and made public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told online newspapers that the hack was "shameful" and those who were targeted "feel humiliated".
It's believed the hacker obtained 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of her upstairs, uncluttered, by the pool.
Palmer appeared in Love and Honor as Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series and the Sucker Punch Browning actress, did not comment on the stolen footage yesterday.
Lawrence's representative told TMZ, "This is a clear violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is just like selling stolen goods".
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma football players have taken the league without winning
The thunder and lightning that Olomouc Sigma co-owner Josef Leber sent down on his subordinates last week seem to be a thing of the past.
Being from Opava only brought a point for a goalless draw.
They've done a little bit of good for the club boss.
The paychecks could be coming to the club soon.
"I'm going to keep one more game, as I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic", LeBron confirmed that although Sigma didn't win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The fighting and the commitment that we played with mostly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I can forgive him not winning.
If we had played like this from the start of the season, I'm convinced we wouldn't have lost yet", says LeBron.
Sigma in Opava overcame the initial pressure from the home side, then tied the game and in the second half they were better.
After the victory of Calvados, the faithful reached out, but their chances did not reach the goal, and so they could not win.
The result is not what we expected.
"We were not able to get the ball to the ground, but we were just missing one converted chance to complete satisfaction", said LeBron, who did not think that the change in the approach of the players was caused by his threat alone.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether it's from me, from the coach or from the fans", said LeBron.
The pressure is something Sigma has to count on.
The players didn't want to comment on the events of last week after the game in Opava.
I'm trying to get rid of all this stuff.
I tried not to let it happen", young goalkeeper Michal Reichl nodded.
Without commenting, he left a question on Lebro's statement from last week, the striker Václav Vasiček, who did not turn the biggest opportunity of Sigma in Saturday's match.
But then he did talk a little bit about the pressure.
We're gonna be under pressure all the time.
Everybody's trying to get on our case.
Today we showed that if we fight and we all fuck up, we can do it", he said.
They Heeded the Warnings
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys have realized that, and today it was clear that they took Mr. Leber's warning to heart.
Even before that, it wasn't that they didn't want to fight and they turned it down", the Olomouc coach said.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to get over the toughness and realize what the second league was all about.
That it's not just about football, but mainly about the fighting", said Kalvoda.
All we can do is hope that in the next few games, Sigma's gonna start working again.
"I'd like to believe that", he added.
