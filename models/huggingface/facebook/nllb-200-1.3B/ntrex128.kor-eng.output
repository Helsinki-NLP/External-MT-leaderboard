The Welsh Senators were concerned that the shrimp looked like a hourglass.
Some senators are disappointed by the proposal that their titles should be changed to MWPs.
It was because of a plan to change the name of the parliament to the National Assembly for Wales.
It's across the political spectrum and senators are worried it will provoke ridicule.
One Labour senator was worried that his group would achieve the convergence of the TWPs and the PWPs.
Information for readers living outside Wales: twp in Welsh means stupidity and pwp means shit.
A Welsh National Party senator said the whole group was not happy and had offered an alternative.
One Welsh Conservative said his group had a bit of a grudge about the name change, but noticed it was a bit of a turning point from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of u.
The parliamentary assembly is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name change and the final decision on what to call the members of the parliament will of course be the matter of the members themselves, he said.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the committee announced the results of a public consultation on a proposal that had broad support for calling the parliament the National Assembly for Wales.
In relation to the question of the directness of the Senators, the Committee supported the Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP won the most support in the public consultation.
Senators appear to be proposing alternatives, but efforts to reach an agreement will be a hassle for Speaker Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft bill on the change in a matter of weeks.
The bill on reform also includes changes to the way Parliament works, including rules on disqualification from the Senate and the establishment of a committee system.
Senators will be asked to vote on what they will call when they discuss the bill.
Macedonians vote to change the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which calls one of its provinces Macedonia.
Greece has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour raises territorial issues and has consistently refused to allow the neighbouring country to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Jaaf, argue that the name change is simply the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
Servant of the winter silence of St. Martin as the church of Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the older people I talked to there were bars and churches in every alley", said Mr. Adam.
"Nowadays, not both".
He said he couldn't understand the bar disappearing.
"People are living socially in a different way these days", he says.
"The bar is no longer the regular living room of the neighborhood".
In the case of the church, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't stay as long as the leaders expect, and that the leaders will go back to where they started.
He added that the church could be replaced by a condominium building filled with people who wouldn't help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in this building are going to be white", he said, "so it's going to be a day before these churches close all at once, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are less likely to be members of the church".
Both churches were built by white worshippers in the 1870s, ten years after St. Martin's, before Harlem became a metropolitan community, or black metropolis.
The traditional white Catholics migrated in the 1930s.
A black priest who was worshiping next door had legal title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black cult under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retail stores on Harlem's main shopping street, and opposed hiring or promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but as the parishioners of St. Johnson's planned to rebuild, they ordered the carriage.
The Rev. David Johnson, the Rev. Johnson's son, and the successors of St. Martin's proudly called the Carriage the "end of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a different name: the gift of the carillon culture and the irreplaceable historical instrumental carillon.
And Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carol in the world to be performed by black musician Dionisios A. Lind, who had moved it to a larger carol in the Riverside church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merryweather said that St. Martin had not replaced him.
What's been playing at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some of them involving civil leaders of the church, others involving the bishopric.
The parish's governing body, the sanitarium, is made up of civilian leaders. Although the sanitarium was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors that sent the parish, the sanitarium wrote to the parish in July with concerns that the parish might try to transfer the cost of the sanitarium.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the parish.
He attacked a 13-year-old boy in California while he was diving a lobster.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy diving on Saturday in California, the official said, on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that the boy was diving with a friend for about an hour and a half Saturday morning and that he heard the boy's screams for help and went to the group to try to get him out of the water.
Hamel thought he was a god at first, but he realized he was screaming.
I got bit!"
His skull was completely torn, and Sean Hamel said he realized that the shark had taken the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to come out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Ladi Children's Hospital in San Diego and is on the critical condition list.
The species of shark attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, a lifeguard, told the media that a shark had appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but he had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe trauma to the torso.
Authorities have blocked access to Swansea's Ponto Beach from Casablanca to Escinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles reported that there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them were not dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's will be battling Boots, SuperDrug and Devenhams in the department store style beauty corner where the experts are working.
As part of a massive expansion into the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow amid a withdrawal of fashion and homeware sales, the larger beauty corner will be demonstrated in 11 stores nationwide and will be launched in more stores next year if successful.
Investing in the beauty industry is like a supermarket looking for shelf space that was once occupied by TVs, electronics, and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it would order up to 3,000 units to double the size of the beauty corner, including brands such as Revlon, Desi, Twizerman and Doctor Who, a first.
Conventional brands like L'Oreal, Mabelyn, and Butsby will also take up more space in the same brand area as you'd find in shops like Boots.
The supermarket will also reintroduce its boutique makeup line, allowing most products to be launched as vegan-friendly, which is preferred by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Frangnus Shop is running a demonstration run at two Sainsbury's stores, the first in Croydon, south London and the second in Sale Oaks, Birmingham, at the end of the year.
The shift from online shopping and buying fewer groceries at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Koop, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount stores like Aldina's Leadle, which have more services and non-food products, the outlets will look more and more like department stores.
Sainsbury's has put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced a large number of habibitats, which it did after buying two chains two years ago. Sainsbury's says it has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempts to repair its beauty and pharmacy departments ultimately failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended in a dispute over how to divide the revenues of the supermarket and pharmacy stores.
The new strategy will come after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd's pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Sainsbury's said Lloyd's would play a key role in the plan by expanding the scale of its luxury skincare brands such as La Rochefoucauld and Fish to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hughes, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, says, "We've changed the look and feel of Beauty Corner to improve the customer experience.
We also hired specially trained colleagues to provide the tools.
Our brand range is designed to fit every niche, and our attractive environment and convenient location means we are now in the epicenter of unmistakable beauty that challenges the old-fashioned way of shopping".
After Holly Willows withdraws from an £11 million deal, the disgruntled Peter Jones,
Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, has been in a state of disarray since TV presenter Holly Willow pulled out of an $11 million deal related to his lifestyle brand business to focus on a new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their homeware and malware brand, Truly.
Their business has been compared to the brand of gourmet baked goods.
The 37-year-old anchor announced her departure this morning on Instagram.
Holly Willow left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who was angry at the last minute for pulling out of his profitable lifestyle brand business, to focus on his huge new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones admitted to TV Golden Girl at a tense meeting on Tuesday at his corporate headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal was worth up to £1.5 million, and that it meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homeware and malware brand Truli.
The business was likened to a brand of gourmet and was nearly double Willoway's fortune of about £1,100.
When 37-year-old Willoughby revealed on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane out of the UK and headed for one of his holiday resorts.
According to one source, Truly was Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Her decision completely shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost the exit.
"Marlow has a warehouse full of merchandise waiting to be sold".
Experts believe the departure of one of the UK's most commercially successful morning anchors will be costly due to massive product investments and the possibility of delaying the launch, which will include cushions and everything from the beginning to clothing and homeware.
And that would mean the end of an old friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for a decade.
Willoughby founded Cap and Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Anthony McPhatterine as the host of ITV's Celebrity Big Brother.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we will not be making any announcements about his business".
"And we fell in love".
He joked about the comments he had heard in the news media that someone was not as good as the president of North Korea and the criticism he had received for his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why would President Trump give up so easily?
Trump said in his fake news anchor buzz.
"I didn't give up anything".
According to his description, Kim Jong-un noted the interest of the commissioner in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which was a big step towards denuclearization.
However, the denuclearization negotiations were halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Li Yongho, told world leaders at the UN. At Saturday's summit, North Korea did not hear a coherent response from the United States to North Korea's initial moves to reduce its military capabilities.
He said instead that the US is continuing sanctions aimed at continuing pressure.
Trump showed a much more optimistic outlook in his rally speech.
"We're doing well with North Korea", he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
We have a good relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had had positive results, including completing missile tests, freeing hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. troops home.
And he defended his discriminatory approach to talking about his relationship with Chairman Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside in this crowded stadium, we have 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of the stadium.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
I've heard stories that after the Lompoc earthquake, for example, there was no need for overseas nonprofits.
More than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had left, but there was no official announcement of the need for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance", said Mr. Shafqaf.
While the Sauber Children's team is making its way to Palo, it is not yet clear whether the overseas staff will be able to work on the ground.
Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian officials are looking into the situation in Palo, and whether the international agency can be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Assuming that Indonesia is continuously hit by earthquakes, Indonesia is sadly not prepared enough for the wrath of nature.
The tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, which is not easily found on other coastlines.
Despite the effectiveness of the warning, Fallujah is likely to continue to suffer loss of life if the tsunami warning siren is not in place.
At best, it's difficult to travel between many of Indonesia's islands.
Natural disasters make logistics support even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stranded in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Pallu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's backward infrastructure a priority in his election campaign, and invested heavily in roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has made the government of Joko uncomfortable, as he faces an election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sectarian tensions that remain in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims embrace a more conservative form of faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs engaged in street fighting using knives, bows, arrows and other brutal weapons, killing over 1,000 people and leaving thousands homeless.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has dropped the Equalizers against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Sheldon Shakiri, who was about 30 yards ahead of Chelsea, as the team was trailing 1-0.
He kicked the ball to his left before blowing the shot in front of the far post.
As it moved towards the upper right corner of the skeleton, the ball flew far above the zone.
The ball eventually fell over the jumping Kepa Arisavalaga.
"I was trying to get into that position to get the ball right, because players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to make myself as much as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant coming, and I made a touch, and I didn't think it would pass, and I blew the whistle".
In the 25th minute, Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after scoring from Belgian star Eden Azar.
In that game, the Blues striker passed to Mateo Kovacic, before separating from near midfield and being sent half-power to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick kick and pick in midfield.
And then he led Azar to the box and blew a beautiful whistle.
Azar ran faster than the defender and finished with a left-footed goal, passing Liverpool's Alison Becker in the second-place play-off.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League qualifying match at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday afternoon.
Chelsea will play against Videotron in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster authorities reported Sunday morning.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday reported many people lying on the rubble of the collapsed building and a 20-foot wave, said government spokesman Soto Pouro Nugroho at a news conference.
Fallujah, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for the stabbing death of a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Merseyside Beaconhead.
The body of a 44-year-old man was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Moose, John Street, with injuries, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police strongly urged anyone who had seen or heard anything in the area to help.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would urge anyone who sees or hears anything suspicious in the John Street area to contact us".
I'm also going to appeal to anyone who may have information that's important to our investigation, who may have something on the dash cam footage, especially taxi drivers".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Beaconhead and was found inside a private property.
Friends who say they know the woman arrived at the scene this morning to ask where she was found.
Police said they were in the process of escorting the victim to a close relative, and that an investigation was underway.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one could enter or leave the building.
When he discovered what had happened, he said nothing.
Residents are told it will take a few hours to be allowed in.
One officer overheard a man say that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
One woman appeared on the scene crying.
She repeats the words "It's so awful".
Two police cars are out of the lowway at 2pm and another car is out.
Many police officers were standing inside the low-level line guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information can either DM @MerPolCC, dial 101 or call or Crimestopper on 0800 555 111 with reference to log 247.
The Cromwell statue in the National Assembly is the most recent monument to hit the history books with a bird's eye view.
Its expulsion may be a poetic definition of his Talibanist destruction of many of Britain's cultural and religious relics produced by his fervent Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell League described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "silly, silly attempt to rewrite the history of the Cromwellian".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Federation, said: "In the current debate over the destruction of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be the target.
The destruction of the British Civil War statues was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed in the last century by the actions of his ancestor, Thomas.
The remarkable Cromwell re-enactment of Sir William Hamo Soniccroft is a testament to 19th-century popular opinion and a historical record of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was more recognized in the late 19th century than today as the defender of Parliament against external oppression in the monarchy.
Whether it is a perfectly accurate reproduction is a continuing historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the development of our country, and Cromwell was a remarkable figure who represented one side of that division.
His achievements as the protector of the monarch are also to be celebrated".
The killing pigs drive the Chinese farmer to his death.
A farmer in southwest China was attacked by a pig in a market and died, local media reported.
The man, identified only as Xuan Yuan, was found dead with an aorta severed and covered in blood near a pig market in the Ryufanshui district of Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig in Xining, Qinghai province, China, May 30, 2005.
He reportedly went to the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday with his cousin to sell fifteen pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin saw him dead, and next to the pigs found our door open.
He told us that we had a big water bucket with blood in it.
According to reports, forensic examiners have confirmed that a 550-pound pig was injured and killed by a farmer.
"My cousin's leg was badly damaged by the pitus, said his cousin, known as Mr. Chiu-Wei, as reported by Guoyun Evening News.
Surveillance footage showed Mr. Uayan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Consolidate or his cousin.
While police were gathering evidence at the scene, the mayor told the evening news that the pig was being held in order to prevent it from attacking the man.
According to reports, the family of the deceased is negotiating compensation for his death.
Rare, but previously documented, cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, leaving him with fatal injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer, and this continued until his wife chased the pig.
"A Manitoba farmer told CBC News that after an Oregon farmer was fed by his pigs in 2012, "the pigs were unusually aggressive, but the taste of blood could play a role in triggering the fire".
"They're just playing.
They're young, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
"You have to have enough respect for pigs", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread rainfall to the northwest United States.
According to daily forecasts, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves into the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, Rosa was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Orgonia, Mexico.
Rosa is predicted to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the atmospheric crust will take shape in the Pacific Ocean and begin to move eastward toward the U.S. west coast. Rosa will begin to send deep tropical moisture northward toward the U.S. southwest as it approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the approaching atmospheric moisture, interacting with the atmospheric pressure, will produce a wide range of heavy rainfall over the southwest region for several days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, landslides, and desert deforestation.
Deep tropical rainfall, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona, will be expected to be 2 to 3 inches per hour regionally.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of flash floods due to the rapidly deteriorating weather.
The advice to risk walking through the desert, where the threat of tropical rain is looming, is very bad.
Heavy rainfall can cause rivers to cross and affect the canyon, and thunderstorms can cause tropical and violent winds and hail.
The approaching storm surge will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
The collapse is expected to bring rainfall of more than 1.5 inches, which will float and slip the path.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
The intermittent tropical cyclone will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before spreading further on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
The shower will expand to four corners throughout Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic cools, the crossing across the United States will be intense, but the return route will be warm.
Sometimes this results in extreme temperature changes over short distances.
The big temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday is a good example.
There was a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the summer heat will continue and expand again.
Many parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to begin to experience temperatures of 80 degrees in October, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could see an average of 10 degrees and a high of 80 degrees on Tuesday.
Our long-term forecast predicts that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to be above average in early October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Caverno hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kaverno and Christine Flashford, a woman who was accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s, on the Six Network on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued with stations disrupting the regular Friday night broadcasts, an arrangement concocted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the case for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavernno tried to strip her naked while she was drunk at a high school party.
Cavern said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's report, more than 2.4 million people are expected to watch it on Friday.
Nielsen was calculating the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers from other broadcasters, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately apparent.
Nielsen usually has some trouble counting the number of people who watched it while working.
That's about the same as the number of people watching a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, which has strong support for Cavernò as an opinion host, topped all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day of the hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC's viewership was second with 3.26 million.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest has not waned since the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republicans made a statement that he was in Cavern's favor, CNN and CBS cameras caught him being yelled at by protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
A video of him standing with his eyes closed for several minutes after he was beaten was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have power when so many women are powerless".
Plek said his office had issued a statement and that he would have to speak more at the committee hearing before the elevator was shut down.
When the Judiciary Committee voted on whether Caberno should be appointed to the Senate plenary, both cable and broadcast networks dealt with live media.
But Flake said he did so on the condition that the FBI would investigate the charges against Caverno in the next state, which the minority Democrats had been urging.
Flake was somewhat convinced in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Hicks.
After a discussion with Hughes and several senators, Plek made a decision.
Plek's choice had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Caverno without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the Caverno allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses a critic of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has denounced critics who say her plans to leave the European Union threaten national understanding and play politics with Britain's future in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 for the Conservative Party meeting.
In another interview with her, which appeared on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the proposal that Britain and the EU should each collect tariffs was "completely uncalled for" and strongly attacked her so-called "Checkers plan for Brexit".
Police arrest Dighton Simpson, suspected of the death of LSU player.
Police arrest a suspect in the fatal shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
20-year-old Dighton Simpson was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Beton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police said they acquired the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to inflicting lethal gunshot wounds on Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, the attorney general's office said.
The East Beton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force and the Police Science Investigation Institute, Southern University Police and local residents are helping with the investigation for the arrest.
LSU head coach Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for their approach and justice implementation.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that Wade's death would cause the team to stumble and fall into a tailspin.
"This is something that's always been worrying me", Wade said.
The volcano is pouring ash over Mexico City.
The eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano has spread from Mexico's capital to its neighbor to the south.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday that they will fall far from the volcano as volcanic activity begins in the flare zone and 183 gases and volcanic material erupts over 24 hours.
The center observed several tremors and weak earthquakes.
You can see photos on social media in cities like Sochimilco, near Mexico City, where car windshields are covered in a thin layer of ash.
Geologists have found a resurgence of volcanic activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-magnitude quake in September 2017 rocked central Mexico.
Known as the Kdong Gyo-kyo volcano, it has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote.
Pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and six were on parade in Barcelona on Saturday. Thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized independence vote.
Masked separatists, who were stopped by the police, spread egg-baptism and threw powdered paint at the police, causing a cloud of black dust on the streets filled with tourists.
There was also a late-night standoff with police using suppression bars to stop the fighting.
For more than a few hours, the pro-independence mobs, along with the unificationists who chanted "Spanish forever", shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tension remains in the region's independence movement even after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal in Spain but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Although voter turnout was usually low with anti-secession voters boycotting the vote, voters overwhelmingly chose independence.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in areas where violent clashes had taken place.
Pro-independence demonstrators spend the night outside to stop the police-backed protests on Friday.
The protest was carried out but was forced to choose another route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrical engineer who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would ever be independent.
"We had one of the best moments last year.
I saw parents crying out for joy that they could vote, but we're stuck right now", he said.
Despite a near-win in the last December local elections, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have been trying to gain momentum this year, along with the most well-known leaders who have been detained, either by going to jail themselves or waiting for their trial for their role in organizing a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records the protests with police assistance over the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The score will be more intense", said the Twig.
Oriol Hunchelas, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed by a preliminary injunction at the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European Parliament is a strong criticism of the decline of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has shown us", said Zang.
London: Men arrested after their home was hit by a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car and a car raided a house in London.
The incident took place at around 7.30pm on Thursday in Ballinagaard Crescent.
Sergeant Bob Flemings said the doors and the building were damaged.
At some point, the tomb may have been fired from a car.
With the first of Menga, Livingston beat Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal saved Livingston from the win.
The promotion of Livingston sent Steven Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ivroks, which shocked Rangers.
Dolly Menga's shaky form proved the difference from when Gary Holt's team took revenge on Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side remained unbeaten in the Premier League this season, and are now tied with the Hearts, who are eight points behind on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Raphit Bin in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues an undefeated run in League Six with Holt, who has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chance to win over the casual visitors.
Holt's team should have been way ahead of Rangers before they scored, with their immediacy causing all the trouble.
Scott Robinson made the breakthrough and went to the front of the goal. Alan Lissgow then slipped to meet Craig Halkitt's headed goal and allowed his breakthrough.
The hosts were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could eat the visitors in a set piece situation.
And that was how we could get the deciding goal in.
Rangers allowed a free throw and Livingston approached to help Menga, who had scored in the middle of the zone, with Declan Gallardo and Robinson to break through.
The Rangers took possession of the ball, but knew they could not break through the home team's defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly gave a big hug.
Alfredo Morelos had obtained a safe from Kelly, but the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan MacGregor. Lissgow moved quickly in another set play for Livingston.
While the challenge of the halcythe against substitute Glenn Middleton and two penalty shootouts with a handball went to waste, Cross kept coming into the Livingston area and continuing out of the grid.

Livingston's amazing performance and the results.
For one man, they were brilliant, continuing to surpass expectations at this age of growth.
Their playing style and organization have hardly changed since returning to the top team, but the big ball will go to Holt, who has given the team a boost.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett excelled at controlling the well-organized defense, and Menga did not stop between the spirited Connor Goldson and Joe Wall.
The Rangers were inspirational, but they were.
As long as they had good times with Jared, they were good at that standard.
Their last ball is once they--and it's like a weather alarm for the Rangers who find themselves in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives a reception at Cologne.
On Saturday, September 29, when the Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for dinner, there were smiles and blue skies.
That day was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, where the alliance's relationship with NATO was under strain.
They had disagreements on issues such as human rights, freedom repression and Turkey's EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest number of Turkish expatriates.
Police heard a security threat to stop the 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to meet the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including a large number of Kurds, also voiced their condemnation of Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The confrontation between the two protests reflects the disagreement between the German-Turks who venerate Erdogan as a hero and those who market him as a dictator.
Dunford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist in London died in a collision with a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 am UK Summer Time at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn on a complex road in the south-east of Deptford, surrounding the town of Bestwood.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and the paramedics were on the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist died in a Johnson crash in Childers, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
The London Police Department said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives of the facts.
Roads were closed, bus routes were made available, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Six prisoners injured in riots
The corrections department said six prison officers were injured in a riot at the heavily guarded men's prison.
At 09:30 on Sunday, UK Summer Time, a riot broke out at HMP Long Latin Prison in Worcestershire, which is still ongoing.
Professional Tornado prison guards are dealing with this noise, which involves eight inmates and one inmate.
The prison guards were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A correctional spokesperson said that specially trained prison staff are being deployed to deal with the ongoing incidents at HMP Long Latin.
Six of the staff were treated for their injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be summoned by the police and sent to prison for longer.
HMP Long Latin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, there were reports that the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, a riot police officer was called in to deal with a serious riot in which a staff member was attacked with a car bomb.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and other areas of the country.
It's rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's unlikely that Hurricane Rosa will save energy while crossing the southwest desert, bringing the risk of flash floods next week.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to land late Monday with rainfall and head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service tweeted: "Since 1950, only 10 tropical depressions have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!"
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona and in other areas.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to experience rainfall of one to two inches, with a total of four inches.
The area that is not threatened by flash floods may be lucky that the rain in Rosa is the area that is suffering from drought.
Flooding is a very serious concern, but some of this rain may fall because the southwest is currently in a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, at least the second-highest risk rating, weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa lands on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico, crossing it.
Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, the hurricane, still a hurricane, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
This storm will meet the icy tides in the Pacific, and weaken in strength.
So, we expect it to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with a tropical storm.
With the amount of rainfall that's coming down across Mexico, there's definitely a risk of flooding.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected in northwest Sonora in Baja California, and up to 10 inches is possible, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, and by Tuesday morning, it will reach the Arizona border at tropical low pressure, then pass through Arizona and move upward into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
The main threat from the wreckage of Rosa and his body is the heavy rainfall that will spread across Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the deserts of the southwest, according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods in the desert and landslides and forest fires in mountainous areas.
Four suspects are wanted for murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton around 4pm on Saturday, British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital in a stable coma.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area in the middle of the night, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police are investigating whether anyone has any evidence of cell phone photos of the situation before the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the wrath and evil of the Democrats.
"Voting for Judge Caverno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's disrespectful and absurd strategy", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Caverno was suffering from the Democrats' malice and rage during the appointment process.
Caverno testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago that he sexually abused her when they were teenagers.
Ford testified to her accusations at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people had seen the extraordinary ability and courage of Caverno that day.
"The confirmation vote for Judge Caverno is a vote to confirm that he is one of the most brilliant jurists of our time, with a great record of public service", he told the West Virginia supporters.
The president made an indirect reference to Cavern's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican voting during the midterm elections.
"We're five weeks away from one of the most important votes of our lives.
I wasn't running, but I was really in a hurry", he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere, fighting for great candidates".
Trump claimed that Democrats were moving in a bid to disrupt and disrupt.
A senior Republican aide to the leadership told CNN that the most important procedural vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on Caverno's appointment is expected to take place at least until Friday.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds, death toll forecast to increase
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and many were swept away by a huge wave that washed ashore, authorities said Saturday.
As waves of up to 18 feet, which swept many people to their deaths and destroyed everything in front of them, overtook the coast as the earthquake subsided, hundreds of people gathered for the opening celebration on the beach in the city of Palo.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the threat of a tsunami hit, people kept doing what they were doing on the beach, they didn't run away immediately, and they ended up being victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPM, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it took cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the ground, and it hit the coastline, and it went through the high seas at 800kph", added Nugroho.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 facilities in Palo.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed a scene where many buildings and shops were destroyed, a bridge was overturned and a mosque collapsed, surrounded by water.
The hailstones rocked the coastline on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people in the same area.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the centuries of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, the statement said.
Nugroho described the damage as a massive landslide, and he said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing, and that the bodies of several victims were found lying under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Ngurah said the casualties and damage were greater as it moved along the 300km (190 miles) coastline north of Palo, called Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the quake.
Communications from Donggala were completely paralyzed without any information, said Nguyen.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", said the Red Cross.
Authorities were criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palouse on Saturday, but officials said the waves hit within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building, in a trance, warning people on the streets below about an impending tsunami.
The water walls hit the beach, and in a matter of minutes, they wash away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately acknowledge this scene.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive outages that disrupted communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military authorities have started sending convoys carrying relief supplies to Jakarta and other cities, but the refugees still need food and other necessities of life, the official said.
The city's airport reopened for relief only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the Fallujah refugee camp on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami has killed more than 800 people.
It's not very good.
World Vision employees from Donggala were transported safely to Pallu, where the employees were evacuating, by airbags installed in the front yard, but they passed a devastating scene on the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
It's not very good.
When they saw the grim moves of aid organizations to start the disaster response, some complained that they were preventing skilled foreign aid workers from reaching Palouse.
According to Indonesian regulations, material and manpower assistance from abroad can only begin if the area is declared a national disaster area.
The referendum has not yet been held.
"It's still a local disaster", said Alia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'Oh, yes, this is a national disaster,' we can open up for international assistance, but we're not there yet.
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami hits in Palo, families and friends of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be a miracle to reverse the despair of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue crews rescued a woman who had been lying under rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two paragliders who went missing in preparation for the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mandagi, and others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his apprentices.
"As a paraglider, I feel a deep sense of responsibility", he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how the story was told during the paragliding ride after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, and he desperately sent a WhatsApp message to the participants of the beach festival in Palo.
His message didn't get the blue check marks, it got the one gray check mark.
I think that means the message hasn't been sent.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up ATMs in Newport on the Levee.
According to news released by the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, while a Brink employee was filling up a cash machine in Newport-on-the-Lake, the thieves stole $26,750.
The driver of the car was preparing to empty an ATM in the amusement park and transfer more money, Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
While he was taking his place, another man jumped from behind a Wemblink employee and stole a suitcase full of money that was supposed to be transported.
The report said that witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to an example.
Announcing the change on Saturday, he tweeted: "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was sometimes nicknamed Yell, and used that name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in mid-June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was expected to feature his new album, Yandhi.
He's the producer of the show, who said he's replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her show for emotional reasons.
In addition to the current professional abbreviation, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think that 'Jew' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, that word means 'Jewish,'" West said earlier this year, talking to radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
"So I'm you, I'm us, and this is us.
It was a change from a single word, "Kane", to an example: our goodness, our evil, our confusion, everything.
It's a reflection of who we are".
He's one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator Jay-Z also keeps hyphens and capital letters, or not.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
As the 50th anniversary of the brutal retaliation against the students approaches, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would not use the military to suppress Mexican citizens.
On October 2, 1968, in that square, the military launched a peaceful protest, killing as many as 300 people at a time as the leftist student movement began to take root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth with monthly grants to students and more openings of public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead younger generations into organized crime.
The U.S. needs to double its A.I. funding.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends on research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, a researcher and AI expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This statement follows the announcement of AI by various departments of the US government in the face of a lack of AI strategy in the US as a whole.
Meanwhile, China announced a plan last year to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Considering that all other countries are so far behind the United States, doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, and we'll find the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of the U.S. making big AI achievements in the future, Lee said in an interview with CNBCD this week.
Lee's book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and he's the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which is investing in Face++, one of China's most promising AI companies.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon, he did research on an AI system that beat out the top-ranked Osello player in the United States, and later he became the head of Microsoft Research and the CEO of Google.
Lee knows about previous U.S. government technology competitions, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and he asked when the next competition would be to help identify the next prophet.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's killing academic leaders, it's the corporations", Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to study AI.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help strengthen the AI development efforts in the United States.
"I think that the AI PhD should be automatically granted permanent residency in the United States", he said.
The Chinese State Council announced in July 2017 the next generation of AI development plans in China.
China's National Natural Science Foundation, which funds academic institutions in a similar way to how other government agencies, including the US National Science Foundation, give a little money to US researchers, says Professor Li that China has a poor quality of academic work.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which was a way to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that they're investing two billion dollars in a project called AI Next.
And as far as the NSF is concerned, the NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation to create the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
A referendum on whether the Macedonians should change their name.
Macedonians held a referendum on Sunday to change the name of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has been hampering efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which was called Macedonia, has maintained the position that the name of its northern neighbor claims ownership of Greek territory, and is opposed to joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments have seen a compromise based on the new name proposed in June, but opponents of nationalism argue that the name change would weaken the ethnic characteristics of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the general election, and the opposition has questioned whether the voting turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for a general election to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper for the general election is: Do you approve of the agreement with Greece and NATO and EU membership?
Supporters of the name change, including Zoran Zaev, argue that it's a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the emerging states from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek membership in organizations like the EU and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
It's not legally binding, but enough of the members of Congress will follow the results of the vote to confirm the results.
A name change requires a two-thirds vote in Congress.
The Central Election Commission said no denials had been reported as of 1 p.m.
But the voter turnout has stalled at just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I'm here to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the capital of Lithuania.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, along with his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, cast their ballots in a referendum on changing the flag of Macedonia to open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Strumiccha, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small performance, lifting chairs in front of a tent set up by people opposed to the general election.
"We're in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them legally, not through the back door", Kabardakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted in Macedonia, they're going to turn their heads to the other side, like China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Joyev said that NATO membership would bring more support to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority of people will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our people are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Jozef after casting his vote.
He said that the results of the exhibition would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll released by the Macedonian polling agency last Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters said they would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of course, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
For a referendum to be successful, we need one more vote out of 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum will be seen as a serious blow to the pro-Western government for the first time since it took power last May.
In the foreground: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes over the whole of Brighton's defence for a goal
In Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly overcame the Brighton defender.
Aguero scored what seemed like an easy goal in the 65th minute.
This Argentine forward got a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He got caught between three of Brighton's defenders, and then he jumped into the open stadium.
And then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender from the edge of Brighton's penalty box before he was knocked out a few more times.
Then he found Sterling and passed to his left.
The Englishman used his first touch in the penalty box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the right side of the net to fight Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"I saw Aguero struggling with a problem with his foot", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We told him he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what really happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment".
But the man who scored the first point for the Sky Blues in that Premier League game was no other than Sterling.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Argo got the ball in the middle of the Brighton area in that game.
He made a stunning pass to Leroy Sane along the left field.
Sane made a few touchdowns before Sterling moved to the far end.
The Sky Blue forward put the ball in the net before being dragged out of bounds.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim and Gensheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim on Tuesday afternoon at 12:55.
Scherzer wants to play Spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoff debate, there's not much reason to lead another start.
But the most competitive Shurzer wants to take the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only when there's still a playoff chance for the Rockies, who are beating the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in the NL West.
The Rockies won the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night to earn at least one wild card spot, but the Rockies are still looking for a way to defend their first regional title.
Even if we don't score, at least we can get on the pitch with the crowd, knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I'll ever face this year.
Why would I want to compete in that?
The Nationals haven't announced their Sunday start yet, but reports suggest that Schurzer is likely to pitch in that situation.
Schurzer, who is starting 34th, will throw the ball in the bullpen session on Thursday, and he'll pitch as usual on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed pitcher is 18-7 this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
While talking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, he made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding the president's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we did was based on November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important votes of our lives.
This is one of the really, really big things. I'm not running, but I'm really in a hurry, and that's why I go everywhere to fight for great candidates".
And Trump went on to say, "Well, you've seen this horrible, terrible radical Democrat, you've seen what's happening right now.
And they decided to use all the means necessary to regain power, and you saw the malice, the abomination.
They don't care about the people they hurt, the people they have to attack to have power and dominance, what they want is power and dominance, and we're not going to give it to them".
He said that the Democrats were moving in the direction of disruption and disruption.
"And you've seen over the last four days, he's called Democrats, disgusting, disgusting, unbelievable, disgusting, disgusting.
He was referring to the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, and he was referring to the Congressional Judiciary Committee, and the name Diane Feinstein was getting a huge buzz from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you see the document?
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I'm waiting, it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a big party.
It's not acceptable for people who tell their stories.
It was hardly surprising that activists from my local party, Momentum, voted to discipline me.
After all, I was the last person to hear Labour MPs say they weren't welcome, and it was all about letting us in.
My fellow congresswoman Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn over disciplinary consent.
And he talked about the importance of responsible economic policy and national security and Europe, ironically, about the same security issues that Jeremy had disagreements with his predecessors.
The following was said at the Nottingham East Labour Party conference on Friday: "We hope the conference will be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that Friday night board meeting was exactly that.
Sadly, today, many of the conversations don't reflect the social landscape, and the promise of a kinder, more decent policy is forgotten, if it's even begun.
It's becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party doesn't accept different views and that all opinions are judged by whether the party leadership accepts them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a candidate, and colleagues who thought they had similar political views to me started expecting me to change my mind about national security issues or the EU single market, or take a political position that I would never have otherwise endorsed.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I said, social media was full of criticism of the middle class, and of my demands to be voted out of the next Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments were politically inclined.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are not shying away from the daily onslaught of sexual or racial discrimination.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current regime is the way that various insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer a big-party, and all the unconscious consensus or shifting of preferences makes the party more sympathetic.
I've been told over the years to avoid attention-grabbing behavior and to not be too hard on myself, or I'll be fine.
But that's not what I wanted to do when I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, angry at the government's indifference to allowing the comprehensive classroom to fall, I have sought to fight for better public services for those in need.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in the House has ever been confused about my policy stance and the areas of conflict with the current leadership.
What I can say to those who started the Friday agreement is that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy trying to show loyalty to the Labour leader, while the country is heading towards a Brexit that is hurting homes, industries and public services.
But really, the only message I want to send is not to House Momentum, but to my constituency, whether Labour or not, and I'm proud to be able to contribute to you, and no threat of eviction or political excuse will stop you from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Air (Ayr) 38 - 17 Melrose (Melrose): Going to the top of Air undefeated
The last two attempts were short of the final result, but there's no doubt that Air deserved to win the great and exciting Tennent's Premiership that day.
The ten who were undefeated were in the lead.
And finally, he was moved to the home side, and he was as good as a defensive player, and he had a good chance to win, and that was something that coach Peter Mulch was really happy about.
We've been through the auditions so far, and we've never been, so I'm happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "The Cheerios did well, they took a better chance than our team did.
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's Trio and Frazier Climo's Converted Air led the way, but when Scottish captain Rory Hughes was given a wild card and the game went to the Warriors, Melrose allowed the opportunity and Jason Baggot took the uncapped Trio.
Climo stretched to give Air a lead on penalties, and just before halftime, he scored, and then turned it into a solo try to save Air from a 17-5 crisis.
But Melrose started to do well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's Trio and the convertible scored a 0 in the relay.
The game was then delayed for a long time by the seriously injured Ruaridh Knott, who was moved to the stretcher, and when the game resumed, Air made a sharp difference in the score through Stafford McDowall's trio and Climo's convertible.
Air's captain Blair Macpherson got a wild card at the time, and Melrose, after intense pressure, put in an extra man in exchange for Bruce Colvine's convertible goal in the tray.
But he came back home, and when Struan Hutchinson got a wild card for tackling a no-ball climb, MacPherson scored a touchdown ahead of Air Maul.
Climo scored a convertible, and he scored again in the second half after Kyle Rowe had collected a box set from David Armstrong and Gregor Henry had sent home the fifth tray.
The star of Still Game is preparing for a new career in the food industry.
Steel Game star Ford Kieran appears to be preparing to move into the service industry after it was discovered that he was named as the head of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he co-starred and wrote with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last show of the show, and Kieran seems to be preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The student refused to comment on the story, but the Scottish Sun reported that Kieran was involved in the Glasgow business promotion scheme.
'The sea is ours': Land-locked Bolivia hopes court will reopen access to the Pacific
The crew patrols the chair-sized naval base at La Paz.
A public building has a navy flag.
From Titicaca to the Amazon, the following surnames are inscribed on the naval bases:
It's our duty to get it back".
Across the land-locked country of Bolivia, the memory of losing our coastline in the 19th century resource conflict with Chile is still vivid, and we are eager to sail the Pacific once more.
As Bolivia awaits the October 1st verdict of the International Court of Justice after five years of deliberation, that hope would probably have peaked in decades.
"There's a momentum, consistency and calm in Bolivia, and of course we're looking forward to the results", said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will see the International Court of Justice ruling on the big screen, hoping to favor the Bolivian claim that Chile has a duty to negotiate for Bolivia to allow it independent access to the sea after decades of deliberations by the Hague executive.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election bid next year, is also quite confident in Monday's ruling.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts believe that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and even then, nothing much will change.
This Netherlands-based UN agency has stated that it has no authority to cede Chile's territory, and that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
It's not surprising that we heard about this in the last talk, and it's only six months away from the International Court of Justice's ruling.
We can go back to the past four years, away from the cause of Bolivia.
"The problem of access to the sea is currently being exploited by the Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
She claimed that Morales' aggressive horse was taking away the favor of the rest of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at the appropriate time, but it's going to be very difficult to continue talking after that.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
It was strange that the former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who was the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that this was a court decision.
He said Monday would bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to open up new horizons in its relationship with Chávez and an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict with Chávez's interests.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the ocean issue as a political tool.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
"A verdict is an opportunity to show that we need to get past it".
He says there's no nuclear weapons until North Korea can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said that if North Korea can't trust the U.S. government, it will never get rid of its nuclear weapons first.
He said this at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue to deliver on the promises made by the leaders of both countries at the Singapore summit.
His remarks were relayed to the United States, where Secretary Mike Pompeo appeared to be re-starting a nuclear policy that had been stalled for more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
This is what he called the American opposition to the continuing sanctions and the declaration of the end of the Korean War, a dream come true for the eventual subjugation of North Korea.
The U.S. government is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless North Korea makes a meaningful disarmament move first.
Kim and President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But because North Korea sees weapons as the only way to ensure security, there is widespread skepticism about whether North Korea is serious about giving up its weapons.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show unveils a huge line of headwear that reaches you from the city center.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block out the sun completely, you don't have to look elsewhere.
The designers Valentino and Tom Browne unveiled several oversized hats on the runway of the eye-catching SS19 collection, which was unveiled at Paris Fashion Week.
Very surreal hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers are putting their amazing creations on the stage.
The most striking piece in Valentino was a beige hat with a wide handle, decorated with feathers that covered the model's head.
Other oversized badges included jewel-studded watermelons, witch-moths, and even pineapples, but they weren't designed to make your head stand up.
Tom Brown also released a bizarre mask selection, which is just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks in different colors had sewn lips, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than Otkutura.
One of them looked like scuba diving gear with a snowboard and goggles, while the other one looked like melted ice cream.
And if you're going to continue with this huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Style observers predicted that a giant bonnet could reach from the center to you.
The special type of hat was heated on the hill of La Bomba, and it's a straw with a foot-wide handle that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski has used.
The brand, which has a passionate fan base, has followed the highly unrealistic hat that has become a social media issue with another huge creation on the market, a wheat straw beef duck that's almost as big as a model wearing a swimsuit with a backpack.
The orange-bunt Lafia bag, decorated with a Lafia princess and a white ladder handle tower, was a highlight of Jacques' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL that he expects to see the wide caps and beach backs arriving in the city centre next summer, and that it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized handbags given the influence of designers.
John Edward: Language skills are essential skills for global citizenship.
Private schools in Scotland have maintained a record of academic excellence, and the real record is that in 2018, they achieved excellent test results, which improved individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields of endeavor.
These schools, which have 30,000 students across Scotland, mostly represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council, strive to provide the best possible service to students and parents.
Private schools are designed to prepare students for adult education and higher education, their chosen careers and their status as global citizens.
As an educational institution that can plan and execute a custom school curriculum, we're seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice among schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak in a language that you can understand, it will go into your head".
If you speak in his language, it will be engraved in his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we can't rely on English alone.
And if you look at the results of the last year's tests, you can see that language is the highest-achieving language in the league, among independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages all got high A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students received A's in Mandarin, 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French, and 63% of students learning Spanish also received A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a vital skill for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages are being considered as a subject choice in independent school curricula, and in aspects like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers' struggles to fill vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
As the future job opportunities that require languages increase, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, the person who learns a second foreign language will have the practical benefit of having these same life-long skills.
When you can communicate directly with people from other countries, the polyglot automatically gets ahead of the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults found that 75% of them were not good enough to converse in a foreign language, and French was the only language spoken by 15% of them.
And that's why it's important to invest in language education for children today.
Multilingualism, especially in the developing world, will give children a better chance to find meaningful jobs.
The languages taught in schools in Scotland will vary.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, and others will teach the languages that are considered most important in the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese, as they look to 2020.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a wide range of languages to choose from within the independent school, with a faculty that is expert in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children for whatever the future holds and gives them the skills they need to succeed.
In the global business environment, there's no denying that languages continue to be very important for the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide these choices, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I must do well.
John Edward is the director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland.
LeBron, making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait for LeBron James to make his debut for the LA Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not decided yet if he's going to play for a few minutes.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website, "It's going to be more than 1 minute, less than 48 minutes".
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that it looks like James will be playing for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' preseason schedule for six games.
He said, "We don't need a preseason game at this stage to prepare".
Trump's West Virginia meeting time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a march tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings that President Trump is scheduled to hold next week in friendly areas like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court still pending, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's Wheeling Rally in West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia State rally live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Caberno, who is nervous over the sexual harassment allegations, as the FBI investigates the Senate's vote to delay the vote for up to a week.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain some power in the run-up to the November election.
The Trump campaign said the five-day rally next week is aimed at "empowering volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand key areas of the Senate and House".
A Trump campaign spokesman, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters in an interview that "Constitutional control is very important to his agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign season".
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally, which will take place tonight at the Wesvanco Arena in Wheeling, will draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be covered by the Pittsburgh media.
This is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out the Republican nominee for West Virginia's Senate, Patrick Morrisy, who is lagging behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, "The fact that the president has to come to the polls to get his vote is not a good sign for Morrissey".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the courage to fight to keep their hopes up for Sunday singles.
After three one-sided sessions, the posthumous game on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The shaky principle of propulsion is a completely invented sporting concept, but it's a concept that athletes truly believe in, and there's no place that makes more sense than this competition.
So where does the momentum go now?
Jordan Spieth, the coach, walked in and said, "They're six points ahead, and now they're four, so I think they've got a little bit of momentum".
Of course, Europe is 12 points ahead, four more points in the game.
As Spice said, Americans think there's a little bit of a wind blowing in the wind, and that's enough to give them a boost, especially since Spice and Justin Thomas not only play together all day, but they're also four to three points each.
Spice was deadly from T to Green, and it's leading the way.
The cheerleading was even louder as his rounds progressed, and as he and Thomas were playing twice after two rounds, he hit a crucial perch to tie game four.
With his fart, which led them to victory in the 15-day game, he shouted a scream that seemed to indicate that he believed the American team had not yet withdrawn from the game.
Spears said, "You have to dig really deep and worry about your game".
Now all these players are gone.
The 18th hole makes the score.
The only players who have scored more points than Spice and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely couple in Europe can't go wrong with four to four.
The Mummywoods were the only couple who didn't go out on Saturday afternoons, but they avoided going out on Saturday mornings and Friday afternoons, and Friday mornings at 9 a.m.
That flow and the energy that flows to them from this buzzing crowd is a testament to their Sunday victory, and there's no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinaire to block a potential European victory as the season drags on.
Rather in different halls both at the same time.
But the story of the glory of Europe is a timeless one.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson teamed up with Alex Noren to create a short film about morning football hero Sergio Garcia.
In the front nine holes, the Spaniards and the Swedes, one and two double, were doing a hole they could never get out of.
But on Sundays, there's no one to help you out of the hall.
Fobball and Fossum are fun to watch closely because of the interaction between players, the suggestions they make, the suggestions they don't make, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe was better as a team, and they were in the lead until the last day, but this Posum match showed that the American team had the courage to fight what some, especially the American side, had suspected.
Europe 10-6 ahead in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe will be in a big advantage in the Ryder Cup final after beating the United States 10-6 in the Fobol and Fossum game on Saturday.
The two-time defending champions Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the excitement with two wins against Tiger Woods, who were struggling to add four points to their record so far at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, overwhelmingly beat the USA in the morning's bowling match to regain the trophy they had stolen from Hazelstein two years earlier, and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. won two games at Fosum, and they put up a lot of resistance, but they couldn't contain the heat.
Jim Furyk's team can keep the trophy if they score eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday.
Fleetwoods have won four straight for the first time as European rookies, but he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed the "Mollywoods" since the breakthrough weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four in four starts.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the foul ball, and they beat the outraged Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a much stronger 5 and 4.
Woods, who played two consecutive games on Saturday, has occasionally been a standout, but is now in 19 of 29 games in the Foosball and Fossum, losing seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who took a break for football this morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Fossum match, losing 2-1 to the world's No. 1 and No. 3 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
Despite the pleasant, windy weather of southwest Paris, Europeans didn't have it their own way.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for American players with two points on Saturday.
They won the Super Bowl with a 2-1 victory over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, then came back and lost the opening two holes in the Super Bowl, beating both Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the final.
Although Furyk's team had to tie to defend the title, it was only the second team in Ryder Cup history to come back from a four-point deficit in singles.
But after two days of second place, Sunday's reversal looks like more than that.
North Korea, without trust, unilateral disarmament is impossible.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the continuing sanctions on the United Nations are deepening mistrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances, North Korea has no way of unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the World Organization's annual meeting, said that North Korea has taken "major friendly measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "But I don't see a response from the United States".
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we don't have confidence in our national security, and in that situation, we can't unilaterally disarm first".
The Foreign Affairs Prize reaffirmed the familiar North Korean complaint about the US resistance to a phased denuclearization of the nuclear weapons, which would be compensated for by the North's gradual measures, but his remarks were significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had done in the past.
The Li Foreign Award was given to the first summit meeting between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12th of last month, where Kim Jong-un pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean Peninsula and Trump referred to the joint pledge to secure North Korea.
North Korea has sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States also rejected demands for easing of the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
Lee's Foreign Policy Prize said, "The United States insists on denuclearization first, increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals by forceful means, and even opposes declaring war".
"The realization that the law can bring us to our knees is the dream of those who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that with the continuing sanctions, our distrust is deepening".
Lee's foreign policy award did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and President Trump, which he highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding, "If the party in this denuclearization issue were the United States and not South Korea, then the Korean peninsula would not be in this stalemate".
However, Lee's tone was clearly different from the tone of the UN General Assembly last year, when President Trump described Kim as a "suicide mission" and declared that North Korea's missile attack on the US was inevitable.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim at the UN this year for his courage in taking measures to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions to be maintained until North Korea was denuclearized.
Wednesday, Trump, it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia claim that Pyongyang should be compensated for the actions taken by the UN Security Council.
But Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, on the third day of the UN Security Council, said, "We must continue to enforce security sanctions vigorously until we achieve complete and final verified denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit after meeting with the Foreign Affairs Minister of the United Nations.
Secretary Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a smooth one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying there was progress, but within hours North Korea accused him of "scam-like demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with President Moon that if the United States took "response" it would dismantle its missile and nuclear warheads.
He said that Kim delivered "compliance measures" in Singapore, including the security measures promised by President Trump and the move to normalize relations with the United States.
Harvard students attend classes to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University has been designed to help all undergraduates sleep better in order to combat the growing cannabis culture through caffeine-addicted "All Night".
One scholar found that students at the world's top universities often are ignorant of the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed this course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the class, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you being taught this now that you're a senior?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
This course, which was first introduced this year, teaches students how good sleep habits help with academics and athletic performance, and how important they are to overall well-being.
Professor Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said that the university had found that students were experiencing severe sleep disorders throughout the state and decided to introduce this program.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one episode, we have a picture of a dorm, where students can click on a cup of coffee, a curtain, a trainer, a book, and hear about the effects of caffeine and light, and how exercise affects sleep deprivation, and the importance of a morning routine.
In another chapter, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus and an interactive icon that makes participants think about their daily lives.
"We know that it's not going to change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just like you have a right to know the health effects of smoking".
He added that the culture of pride in sleeping at night still exists, and that the growing pressures of modern technology and students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said that because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, it should be the secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even if it means not gaining weight.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology in California, helped design this course when Professor Chessler gave one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step is to require all graduate students to take a similar program of study before entering a competing institution.
Professor Keisler advised students to consider setting alarms for when they go to bed and when they wake up, and to be mindful of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your cyclical rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal puts Gerrard's men on the ground
After Steven Gerrard's 1-0 loss at Livingston to Dolly Menga's strike, Rangers suffered another period of traveling depression.
The Ybrooks were looking to record their first win since their 4-1 win against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat the Redbrooks, who were the reigning premiership leaders, by eight points, just as Gerard lost for the second time in 18 games.
The men were full seven minutes before the game, and the lineup for the Rangers' lack of inspiration didn't seem to be level.
Rangers dropped to sixth, but Livingston moved up to third, only behind Hibernian in the goal-kicking.
And it could be a bigger problem for the Rangers, because the good-hearted Calum Spence was hit by a distant object and had to be treated for a head injury.
Gerard has swept the side in the last year and made eight changes to the side that reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the Libby 11 that scored the Hartz last week, and he would have been happy to see his well-pierced suit choke their opponents every time.
The Rangers might have taken possession, but Livingston did more when he had the ball.
They passed Menga's first strike to Scott Pittman for a goal from Alan McGregor, but the midfielder had to take his big chance and score in just two minutes.
A deep-focused Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, hit him hard in the back.
The Rangers had the upper hand, but they were more hopeful than they had been in the last three games.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he should have been penalised for 15 minutes when he collided with Steven Thomson, but the referee, Steven Thomson, overturned the appeal of Colombia.
The Rangers were outscored by just two goals in the first half, but former Ivorks goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hit in the head with a strike by Ovie Ejaria, who was heading and walking Lassanas Coulibaly.
Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the game, but no one can deny that they deserve it just for trying.
Again, the Rangers didn't get the setpiece of Deep Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher scored for Scott Robinson, choosing Menga for a simple finish to keep his composure.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and in his place, Morelos' winger scored a goal that had an almost immediate effect, but Kelly impressed by running over his line to stop him.
But Livingston kept the spectators sucked in, and the kind of game that they enjoyed, as Lisgo and Halkit took long passes at the end of the long line.
Holt could have extended the lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Risgo headed into the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was behind Jacobs and demanded a penalty kick, but Thompson again withdrew.
Related: inventor of the Geiger counter
From a page in the "Sunday Morning" yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and... the day the future German physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive material, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
The Gaiger Counter, which has since become a center of science, also became a center of popular culture in the 1950 film "The Bell of the Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as the unlikely cowboy scientist:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
And if you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radiation of the mineral".
Evans: "Oh, it's definitely going off now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the inventions that bear his name remain.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" and kill malignant cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize the target of the malignant cells to treat.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
And they can see the protein that's common in many cancers and re-inject it.
Experimental vaccines are showing promising results in a variety of cancer patients.
One woman who received this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab, and then "seeing" and then re-injecting them with a protein common to many cancers called HER2.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of many types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer", explains Professor Burzowski.
A similar approach, which is to "teach" how to take immune cells from patients and target cancer cells, has been effective in treating leukemia.
Kanye West, who wore a MAGA hat and appeared on SNL, began a pro-Trump critique.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West performed on Saturday Night Live to praise President Donald Trump and got a wild reaction in the studio after revealing his 2020 presidential candidacy.
That evening, after writing "Make America Great Cap" and singing the third song, "Ghost Town", he continued to protest in a furious voice against the Democrats, and renewed his support for Trump.
"I tell stories to white people a lot of times, and they say, "How can you like Trump when he's a racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL started with a drama starring Matt Damon, where this Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West's scenes of the hoax were posted by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with that post.
Also, West complained to the audience about what he wrote on his head that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
"They were harassing me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat".
They've been harassing me!
And they say I'm where I'm going down", said the Washington examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see the sinking?" and he says, "I'm going to put on my Superman mantle, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Make love to each other".
Variety reported that his comments caused at least two wildcatter by the audience, and that the SNL staff seemed to be in a state of panic, with one person saying, "The whole studio is quiet".
West was hired late as the successor to singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many people with his performance of "I Love It", which was inspired by the disease of Peyer.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the TPUSA representative, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to the riot".
But Karen Hunter, the talk show host, tweeted that West simply said, "Who is he, what a great thing".
"But I chose not to reward anyone I think is embracing and infusing harmful ideas into our society by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art".
He is free.
We are".
Before the show, the rapper announced via Twitter that he had changed his name to "the man now officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to follow Didi, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Peddie, who changed their name.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, who went by the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to an icon, and then became the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in the Belfast restaurant scandal.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Balihakamore.
The accused is due to appear in the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
Those charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, is on the verge of a man's manhood.
Kit Herrington is best known for his role as John Snow, the swordsmith in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor broke the stereotype of the hero of the pot, saying that such roles in movies often mean that young boys feel they have to struggle to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he "believes something is wrong", and questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #Mito era.
Keith, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he feels "very strongly" about dealing with this issue.
"I personally feel pretty strongly, where did we misunderstand masculinity?" he said.
"What have we taught men growing up in terms of the problems we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to the masculine characters.
He went on, 'What is innate and what is learned?
What makes young boys feel, on TV, and on the street, what part of being a man they should be?
I think that's one of the biggest problems of our time: how do we change it?
Because, obviously, something is wrong with the young people".
In the interview, he also hinted that he was "over with the storyline and the horses", and that he would not be doing Game of Thrones or a sequel when the series ends next summer.
Starting in November, Kit will star in the revival of the True West by Sam Shepard, the story of his brother, a filmmaker and thief.
He recently said that he thought meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, so the drama gave me a future family and a life here,' he said.
Rose played Igrit, the love interest of Kit's character John Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the basis of Leslie's family property in Scotland.
China reports a 14% surge in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its own people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to the Health Department.
In the second quarter of 2018, we reported about 40,000 new cases.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, which shows that this is different from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the Chinese Health Authority said at a conference in Winan City that the number of people infected with HIV in this way has almost halved.
But the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 people every year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a hot topic in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was banned in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the conservative values of this country, studies have estimated that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Much of the transmission of disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaks by her staff, and has been accused of "dangerous lies" and "publicity".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday accused her staff of posting the personal information of three Republican senators on the congressional Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that this claim is being reported by "extreme right" experts and websites.
Waters tweeted in a statement that he was "lying, lying, lying more".
The information released included the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch.
The information was reportedly posted online by an unknown person during a Senate hearing on Thursday on the sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill.
This leak came after three senators questioned Caverno.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses that verified the origin of the post were associated with Waters' office, and Hill reported that they had disclosed information from one of Waters' employees.
Waters claimed, "This unfounded claim is completely false, absolutely false".
"None of my employees, whose identity, privacy, and safety were compromised by these fraudulent and false claims, were ever responsible for this leak.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false".
Waters's last name was condemned online, and the former White House press secretary agreed.
Fleischer wrote, "I am angry at this denial".
"This suggests she's not cut out to be a member of parliament.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They should not resist.
They should not question the motives of the accuser.
They need to be calm and calm".
Fleisher appeared to compare Waters's reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Caverno, who was accused by critics of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who ran to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
He tweeted, "If it's true, it's a big deal".
Waters said in a statement that he was "warning the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about such fraudulent claims".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed", he added, "and they will be destroyed by all my employees and will be held legally responsible for any dangerous behavior".
Johnny English Strike Review - The Spy Parody of Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional for any new film with a British perspective to look for the Brexit crisis, which seems to apply to the revival of the British action-comedy parody franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Ribbon.
Will self-deprecating jokes about how obviously garbage we are become the nation's new export agency?
Anyway, the big-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English was more qualified than anything else to create a vast comedic creation designed for a region where non-English speaking film fans are.
Of course, he's a bit of a clown, with his youthful charm as a secret agent despite his bizarre appearance, and the breakthrough of Mr. Bean, who contributed a note to the theme song for the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He also appeared in a now-forgotten Barclay Card TV commercial, where he was basically a traveler and the internationally mysterious Arkinson, who disrupted his career.
There's a couple of great moments in this little English outing.
I liked the way Johnny English, with his medieval armor and his rotating wings, briefly slammed his helmet and approached the helicopter.
I can see Dickinson's talent for physical comedy, but the humor is pretty extreme and weirdly exaggerated, especially since "sensitive" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are now confidently providing comedy material.
It's like the humor is more aimed at kids than adults, and to me, the suicidal thinking of Johnny English is not as creative and focused as the Jenkinsons' silent film in "Person of the Moon".
The permanent thematic premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
By breaking into Britain's secret spy web network, a cyber hacker exposed the identities of every British agent in the field, and he was a disappointment to Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
The last of the arrogant, self-righteous prime ministers who are already experiencing a complete collapse of political popularity. Emma Thompson does her best as this non-Theresa May character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since all active spies are at risk, she'll need to get someone retired back on the job.
And that means that Channy English is currently employed as a principal in some fancy facility, but she's giving an informal class on how to become a masked operative, and I've got some cool bugs here, like how I'm offering a rock-style spy academy.
English rushes back to White Hall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant, Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bowe is now married to the late Vicky Pepperdine, a passionate athlete and submarine commander who was unlucky to be cast.
So Batman and Robin, who have been so badly misled by Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action when they encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful stepmother, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prize is being threatened by the demands of charismatic tech billionaire Jason Volta, who claims he can solve the UK's computer problems.
English and Bow begin their comedic play journey, disguising themselves as waiters, lighting up fancy French restaurants, smuggling in a luxury yacht in Volta, and creating a mess when English tries to use a virtual reality headset to get used to the interior of Volta's home.
It's all definitely gone for that last scene, but as fun and exuberant as it is about everything, it's like children's TV.
Pretty much right.
And like other British films, could the British film industry really give Rowan Arkinson a role that matched his talent?
I'm denying that the British Labour Party is coming up with a plan to work four days a week and get paid five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan to see British people working four days a week but getting paid five days.
The Labour Party reportedly hopes that the CEOs will use the savings made by the AI revolution to give workers an extra day off.
It's going to see employees enjoy three days of the weekend, but still take home the same pay.
Sources said that the idea would "fit" into the party's economic agenda and would be a plan to lean the country toward workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: "We expect a policy review to be announced before the speech.
"It may not be a morning thing, but the four-day work week is a key component of the party's approach to economic restructuring that is favorable to workers and is consistent with the party's overall industrial strategy".
With the Greens promising a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election, Labour may not be the first to support such a proposal.
But that ambition is not supported by the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour spokesman said: "Four-day work week is not party policy, and it is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party meeting last week to articulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he wanted to take back power from the faceless directors and producers in the public sector.
The Shadow Cabinet's plan also means that the Labour government could be 'excommunicated' for misconduct, so the current shareholders of the water company may not get their full shares back.
He also planned to put workers on the company board and to create a comprehensive equity fund to give employees 10% of the shares in private companies, so that they would have a dividend of up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes, and the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, will change their minds.
The FBI's indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for chief justice by at least a week, and questions have been raised as to whether the FBI's findings will shake up Republican senators and draw their support.
Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Sensi, the Republican party, in an interview aired Sunday, whether John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
He said he talked to Cavernopanc with the idea of joining the audience.
I called him after this happened, the charges were brought and I said, "What did you do?"
He was firm, he was firm, he was clear.
But Graham's vote seems to be decisive.
He said that Wenger had decided on Brett Caverno, and that it would take a huge amount of blame.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it, and Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all the people she nominated couldn't verify it.
I'm 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual musical event with some of the most impressive stars performing on an equally important mission: ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty, was launched in 2012.
To get free admission to the event, the concertgoers had to complete a series of "actions" such as either volunteering, emailing, calling the world's representatives, or creating other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the last 12 years been for Global Citizen in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts really a way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another example of so-called "crickettivism" that feels like you're making a real difference by signing online petitions or tweeting?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters since 2011 and is pushing for other goals.
These actions, he said, have helped world leaders make more than $37.7 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The organization cited 390 pledges and announcements that started with that action in early 2018, of which at least $10 billion had already been spent or funded.
The organization estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key commitments is the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of British investors and implementers that has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the region after receiving over 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social inequality and undernutrition a cornerstone of history", said Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition Ambassador, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition to Intervene in Nutrition for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long, hard road, and sometimes we're going to fall or fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will win, because together we become stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cady Bee, Janelle Monáe are performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy as a "lock" to prevent Russian energy exports.
As Washington's investigator quoted, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said that Washington could rely on the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from invading markets, including in the Middle East.
Jinke argued that Russia's intervention in Syria, which is being carried out at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a stepping stone to opening up a new energy market.
He was quoted as saying, "I think they're in the Middle East to mediate energy, like in southern and eastern Europe".
And, according to the people involved, there are ways and means to solve it.
He said, "The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to open up the sea lines, to block them if necessary, to keep their energy from going to the market".
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself the "Voice of the Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He compared the way the United States deals with Russia and Iran, and noted that Russia and Iran are essentially the same.
He referred to Russia as a trick-or-treater with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy, and said, "The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuel".
This statement comes as the Trump administration is fulfilling its mandate to increase LNG exports to Europe to replace Russia as a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, President Donald Trump and Trump administration officials are trying to convince the United States to pull Germany out of the ill-fated Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into Moscow's pawnshop.
Russia has repeatedly emphasized that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which aims to double the capacity of the existing pipeline by 110 billion square meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the US's vehement opposition to the project is driven purely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy minister, in Moscow in September, "We recognize that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers".
The American position provoked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the plan.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has urged the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
And after a recent meeting between Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, Dieter Kempf, the president of the German Industrial Association, said, "We have a big problem when third countries interfere with our energy supply".
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, says she'll be very careful about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be "excited" to run for president after the midterm elections on May 25.
Warren confirmed at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that she was considering running.
Congress says, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and women have risen to the top", she said.
"After November 6th, I'm going to complain about running for president".
Warren was evaluating President Donald Trump at the town hall, saying that he was pulling the county in the wrong direction.
She said, "I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy".
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kaverno.
Warren tweeted Friday, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
A poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe found that 58% of eligible Massachusetts voters said that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent voted for that.
This poll showed that Deval Patrick was more supportive of running for governor, with 38% in favor and 48% against.
Other celebrities discussed in connection with the 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the AP reported.
Sarah Palin quotes from the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, was drafted in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
She said at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in support of Donald Trump, "What my son is going through, what he's coming back, I can empathize with other families who are feeling PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers have suffered".
And Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and she said of her son and other veterans, "They come back a little different, come back tough, wondering if their fellow soldiers, the Air Force, and all the other military members have any respect for what they've given to the country".
Dan Bennett, a Wasilla police spokesman, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with obstructing a report of domestic violence against a woman and of possessing a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to new asylum policies.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and counties on Friday submitted court opinions in Washington in support of refugees opposing the policy.
The full name of the lawsuit against Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not yet been revealed.
She said her partner, her mother-in-law, and her son, a violent gangster, abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have a high number of U.S. asylum seekers, as countries plagued by gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Regents to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
"The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, issued a statement Friday saying, "This new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that any asylum application be determined by the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a state law violates that principle", the court opinion of the friendship noted.
The lawyers also argued in the lawsuit that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions stated in his June 11 policy statement that "those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion may seek asylum".
Asylum was not meant to alleviate all the problems that people around the world face every day, even all the serious problems.
Deadly rescue efforts in Palo Alto as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse.
The 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kusuma, comforts her son who was burned at the stake in the ruined Pallu City shelter, saying, "I'm very nervous".
"Every minute, an ambulance is bringing bodies in.
There's no clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for their flooded possessions, trying to salvage everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had a broken hip and shoulder, were resting outside the Palouse Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in the open air due to severe shaking.
He was moved by the feeling of the tremor shaking the fifth-floor hotel room where he lived with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save myself.
Harris said, "I think I was dragged into the rubble of the wall", she told the Associated Press, adding that her family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I just hope they're safe.
The American ambassador is suing China for harassing them with propaganda.
The US ambassador accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda, a week after China's official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily for the mutual benefit of US-China trade.
President Donald Trump last Wednesday commented on the subsidy paid by China after accusing it of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper.
Trump's accusations that China was trying to interfere in the US election brought to mind what US officials said in an interview with Reuters that Washington was a new frontier for pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, China and the United States are currently caught in a growing trade war, where they see each other's imports being taxed.
At the beginning of the trade war, China said that the retaliatory tariffs were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to the US and the governor of Iowa, a major exporter of Chinese agricultural products, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a commentary letter published in the Sunday Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China is "now doubling down on harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press".
Branstad wrote, "The Chinese government is using the tradition of press and freedom of expression that America cherishes, by spreading propaganda and putting paid ads in the Des Moines Register".
He wrote, "On the contrary, here in Beijing, the press will find a limited voice of opposition, and given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, it will not reflect at all the ideological views that the Chinese have about the economic trajectory that is worrying".
He added that he "avoided publishing his article in one of China's leading newspapers", but did not say which one.
Republicans are warning that moderate female voters ahead of Kavanaugh Debacle are being ostracized.
With many Republican leaders supporting and defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault, analysts warned that the upcoming midterm elections will be a setback, especially for women.
The sentiment around this has been extremely heated, and it shows that most Republicans already want to vote.
"These things are irreversible", said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published by Congress on Saturday.
Leher said he doubted that the latest crackdown on the FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake would be enough to drive off angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, they will not forget it in November", according to the Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive organization MoveOn said Friday.
When the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to force Kaverno's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford on Friday morning, protesters entered the Senate corridor and shouted, "November is coming!"
"The passion and the deceit of the Democratic Party are falling out of the popularity charts", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, said on a news website.
The Chinese are saying they've already got high numbers: Yes.
But it's especially higher among suburban, upper-class female voters who don't like the president, but don't vote often, and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29".
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, there was a growing concern that Republicans would backtrack if they violated the ratification.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, "This is a confusing situation for the Republican Party".
"It's not just about committee voting or the final vote, it's not about whether Cavern will get on the bench, it's about how the Republicans handled this issue and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of the American Priorities Council, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But from the testimony of Ford and Caberno, Americans seem to have a rather divided opinion about who to believe.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents said they definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Cavernano.
And 38% said they thought Cavern would lie during the testimony, and 30% said they would lie about Ford.
The FBI is investigating charges brought by not only Ford but at least one of the plaintiffs, Deborah Ramirez, after the Flake investigation, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavern was 17 years old when he assaulted her while drunk.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Plans, the founders of Google and Facebook, are starting a new Internet to take over.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Burns Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In a one-on-one interview with Fast Company, Burns Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was to "dominate the world".
He said, "Now, you have to do it.
"This is a historic moment".
This app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, schedule management, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all of which are available in one browser at a time.
What's unique about personal online data stores is that it's entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information they can access.
The company calls this "data-driven empowerment".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and the right technology to help everyone use Solid products.
The company is now made up of a security platform that Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM have acquired, some of the field developers that have signed on to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own distributed apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burns Lee and his team have said that they're not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they're going to introduce a complete change that will completely upgrade all their business models overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Burns Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on commercial energy and Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burns Lee has been a powerful voice in the pure-neutrality debate.
Even while starting Inrupt, Burns Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Memorial to the Victorian Crusaders of the First World War
The only Anglican clergyman to win a victory as a fighter in the Victorian Crusades during World War I has been commemorated in his hometown for over 100 years.
Lieutenant Bernard van Reuven was awarded for his actions on 29 September 1918 against the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he didn't know that he was killed by a sniper four days later and had been awarded the British Army's highest decoration.
His two grandchildren unveiled the memorial at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the monument, exactly 100 years later, is a "sacred symbol" that reveals his grandfather's award-winning career.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog, under the concentrated bombardment of artillery and machine guns".
He later rushed up to the firing line, led the line forward as "the greatest warrior", and then with a single stroke he rushed into the cannon, knocking down three of the platoon.
Lieutenant Van was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said, "I know I'll never be able to follow his actions, but it's a little bit of a stretch".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said, "It's a great honor to be in the parade", adding, "The courage of a true hero is proven by the support he receives from so many people".
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 get Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you've been watching the crowded Bellator 206 all night, but you've been denied access to the main event.
The San Jose program had 13 games, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 all night in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gerard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, British viewers were stunned when the coverage shifted to Peppa Pig.
Some of them, especially after staying up late for the game, didn't feel anything.
One Twitter fan described the shift to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said, "We had to switch to a children's program at 6 a.m. because the content was inappropriate, but that's the government's policy".
I'm not going to be able to do this.
Scott Coker, the CEO of Bellator, said that they would plan their schedule to include the British audience in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, we might be able to sort it out", Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we're not going to be able to solve this problem until Sunday, which is their time, which is our time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when that changed, a lot of letters came and went, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that next time, it won't happen.
We're going to reduce it to five games instead of the usual six, and we're trying to give the fans too much, and we just went overboard.
It's a sad state of affairs".
Tom Daley felt "equal" about his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
He said that he didn't realize that "everyone is not like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking about the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne gave me, he said he spoke out about gay rights, which gives other people hope.
He also said that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a break for several months due to illness.
In her first Laverne show, as a cast member, Daily said she felt "like I was more of a bum than everybody else because it was not socially acceptable to like men and women".
He said, "Those feelings of feeling less and feeling different than I did today, were the real things that gave me the strength and the courage to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was something, something, something, and he said that he didn't disappoint everyone when he finally found out what he was.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a prominent LGBT activist, using his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries not to punish homosexuality.
He said he was lucky to be able to live in the open without waves, and he said it because he wanted to give people a glimmer of hope.
The three-time world champion said, "I felt amazing", when she met and fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black in 2013.
Daily said that she married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so much at such a young age", he said -- he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- "it was hard to find a climber who had gone through the same kind of trauma".
The couple became parents of a son they named Robert Ray Black last June, and the Daily said his "comprehensive perspective" had changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, it was, 'You should win the gold medal.'"
There's something bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
The Daily said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of his last requests was if they still had their 2012 London tickets, because he wanted to be on the front lines.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You can't be in the front line,'" he said.
He said that he was holding his hand while he was breathing, and it was only after he actually stopped breathing that I admitted that he was not a killer.
The next year, she competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, diving in front of home fans at the Olympics, and it didn't feel better", he said.
It also inspired his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which resonated with him in the gymnastics up to the Olympics, and still resonates.
Desert Island Discs is on Sunday at 11:15am on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson is in bad shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set the record for the 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll have to turn the ball over to avoid a disastrous milestone.
Mickelson played his 12th game in the biennial tournament, and was benched by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday with a penalty and foul.
Instead of being the center of that action, as he's often been for America, the five-time major winner spent the day between being a cheerleader and working on the field, trying to figure out what would help him.
The 48-year-old, who never had the most straightforward driver in his prime, is not ideal on the tight Le Golf National course where the long run is routinely punished for wrong turns.
And if the course itself isn't overwhelming, Mickelson will play in his ninth game on Sunday against the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the first 12 games of the regular season, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk couldn't say much else, but she expressed confidence in her man.
Furyk said, "He understood his role today, he patted me on the back, he looked around my arm, and he said, 'I'm ready for tomorrow.'"
"He has great self-confidence.
He's a hall of fame and he's added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it worked out and that's how we thought we should go.
He wants to be outside like everyone else.
Mickelson is set to surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched his personal record height.
Mickelson is on a record of 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 ties, but Furick said his presence has brought a little bit of a gap in the team.
"He's funny, he's witty, he's witty, he likes to make fun of people, he's a great guy in the team room", he explained.
I think it's funny that the young players have given him a room this week.
He offers more than just playing.
The European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the Great Lead may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup in singles can easily turn into an uncomfortable win.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros, five points ahead of the Americans, barely made it past the finish line with the narrowest score margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
You keep reminding us that we had a big lead at Valdelamma; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, which we lost, and at Valdelamma, which we won, but we just won.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You'll be completely bored tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until you get the point.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I'm always focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know so well what's on the other side, and that's the best players in the world.
Bjorn was pleased with how his players played on the tough golf course, adding: "Chenna will never be ahead of this.
Tomorrow is different people.
Tomorrow is a solo show, which is a little different.
It's good to be with a partner when things are good, but when you're going out on your own, you're being tested to see if you're up to the task as a golfer.
That's the message we need to send to the players, to do our best tomorrow.
Now, leaving the partner, he has to go and get the best out of himself.
In contrast to the Bison, the opposing team, Jim Furyk, will find his players to do better individually, with Jordan Spieth, who scored three points out of four, or Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four, as an exceptional partner.
Furyk himself was at a major turning point on the final day of his career, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, when Europe broke the Magic Shield and lost to the West Indies.
When asked how captain Ben Crenshaw got the players through to the final day in 1999, he said, "I remember all the shit".
There are 12 big games tomorrow, and you want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina?
When that momentum flows in one direction, it puts a lot of strain on the middlegames.
We lined up and sent men out in a way that felt like we could do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was challenged to take on Rory McIlroy in the first round, and European players such as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter joined the first round.
Bjorn said about the singles selection, "I think I know everything, I followed this order".
The new German battleship was delayed again.
The latest German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War-era armament, but due to the flawed system and skyrocketing costs, local media reported that it would not be there until at least next year.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman, the approval of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Rheinland-Pfalz, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but a problem after delivery plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It's being identified as having some stealth technology, including powerful artillery, a range of air and naval missiles, and radar attenuation, infrared, and sound signalling.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance period, which means that the latest frigate should be able to deploy at home port for up to two years.
But the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art military that allows Germany to project power overseas will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit said.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after the delivery.
Although little is known about the background of the return, the German media frequently cited critical software and hardware flaws that rendered the weapon useless when deployed in combat.
The Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by about 120 sailors, only half the manpower of the old Bremen class, so the software flaws were particularly important.
Also, it turns out that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade further in the future.
The 7000t class of Rhineland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the hardware flaws, the pricing of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It's up from $2.2 billion to $3.1 billion.
In light of recent warnings about the decline of the German navy, the issue of capturing the latest frigates is particularly important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German parliamentary defense minister, admitted that the navy was actually "running out of deployable traps".
The official said that the problem is growing like snowballs over time because the old ships have been dismantled, but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were fit for the Navy.
The National Trust has been listening to the secret organism of bats.
A new study being conducted on a private reserve in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use this landscape when they hunt for prey.
We hope this discovery will help us to shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow brown long-eared bats and Daubento bats, as well as the common soprano pipistrels and soprano pipistrels, at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using mobile detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and what species are doing.
We're going to create habitat maps and reports that will create a detailed landscape map of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help us determine the benefits of managing habitats like grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across England have declined significantly over the last century.
They're threatened by construction and development that affects the habitat loss and the conservation of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be dangerous, because of the chemical processing of foil and building materials, as well as the attack of pets.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes for catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technology to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
The NTS, which manages over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously.
Ten trained experts regularly conduct investigations and tests, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation is the first in Scotland to have designated a bat conservation area in the Trimble area of Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species currently living in Scotland are found.
According to the site manager David Thompson, the site is an ideal habitat for bats.
And David also says, "There's a very good bat-friendly area in Thurib".
"There are old buildings, there are tall trees lying on the ground, there is everything you need for bat colonization.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, and we're going to understand the many things that are necessary for bat reproduction while protecting bats in this territory and in other areas".
David emphasized that it's important to check the requirements before managing a bat habitat because if one bat breeding site is destroyed unintentionally, up to 400 females and young bats could die, and the resulting bat populations in the area could become extinct.
Currently, bats are protected and acts that kill, harass or disrupt bats, including destruction of breeding grounds, are legally prohibited.
Elizabeth Perell, who works for the Scottish Bat Foundation, asked her to actively participate in the bat protection effort.
"We still have a lot to learn about the bats and how the various species that live in Scotland thrive", says Perell.
Ronaldo denies sexual assault charges and plans to sue a German magazine through his lawyer.
Cristiano Ronaldo refuted the allegations of sexual assault against him as "fake news" that "concerned people manipulated to use his name to gain fame".
Lawyers for Ronaldo plan to sue German news magazine Spiegel for its coverage of his sexual assault allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of sexually assaulting American Catherine Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to a report by the Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo paid $375,000 to the woman after she was forced to have sex with him.
Hours after the alleged sexual assault was reported, Honaldou, 33, refuted the alleged sexual assault reporting as "fake news" via an Instagram live broadcast to 142 million followers.
"No, that's not true.
The news that we've reported today is completely fake news", said five-time Ballon d'Or winner, looking at the camera.
"They're trying to use my name to get famous.
It's not a new thing.
I'm trying to make a name for myself, and the press is always going to be all over this stuff that's going to be a big deal.
I'm very happy and everything is going smoothly".
According to Reuters, the lawyer for Honaldu said the case was "unacceptable news that violates privacy", and that it was against Spiegel for reporting suspicions of sexual assault.
According to Cristiano Serts, a lawyer for the company, "This is one of the worst cases of violation of privacy rights in recent years, and the company is seeking damages for the moral damage and the seriousness of the violation of privacy rights".
The alleged sexual assault occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Mr. and Mrs. Mayorga met at a nightclub and went up to the hotel room where Mr. Mayorga was staying, after which Mr. Mayorga forced and suppressed the attempted sexual intercourse.
According to Mayorga, Honaldo got down on his knees after the sexual assault and said that he was "99% good" and did it because of "1% bad".
According to the documents filed, Honaldu admitted to having sex with Mayorga, but claimed it was consensual.
Mallorca said she went to the police station after the sexual assault and reported it and took pictures of the wounded parts in the hospital, but agreed to consult later "for fear of reprisals" and "for fear of being publicly humiliated".
Now 34, Mayorka said she wanted to cancel the agreement because she had suffered a continuing trauma from the sexual assault.
Ronaldo was in the lead of a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged sexual assault, and this summer he moved to the powerful Italian club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: UK carmakers 'will regret leaving' after the withdrawal
UK Industry Secretary Greg Clarke said the UK's industry, which had been a leader in car manufacturing since Brexit, would be "turned upside down" and "regretful".
A Toyota official also told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without any agreement, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Barnstone near Derby, with Minister Clarke raising his "voice of confidence".
"We need to reach a compromise", Secretary Clark emphasized.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, if Brexit is implemented without an agreement, there could be delays in crossing the border and a reduction in jobs, and even a situation where you have to flee.
The Bernaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Oris and Avensis, exported 90% of the 150,000 cars produced last year to EU member states.
"I think if the UK does Brexit at the end of March, we're going to have to stop production", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and others, have also expressed unease about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will be conducted.
For example, a BMW official said that they would close their mini factory in Oxford from the next month when Brexit takes effect.
The carmakers are concerned that a no-deal Brexit could cause a major disruption to the supply chain.
Toyota's production line is not built on the "JIT" method, which is to build a car by stacking parts, but by ordering them on the spot, so the parts needed to produce the ordered car arrive from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK does not agree to Brexit on 29 March, there will be problems with the passage of parts across the border, leading to delays and shortages.
A Toyota plant in Derbyshire said it would stop production as it was impossible to store more than a day's stock.
Secretary Clark noted that when Theresa May plans future relations with the EU, "we need to be specific about not going through unnecessary verification procedures at the international level".
"We need a consultation that is urgently needed, not only to capture the success that is now in sight, but also the opportunities that Brexit brings", Minister Clark said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Considering the concerns of not only Toyota but other car manufacturers, we should be able to ensure that the supply chain structure that has been successfully operated so far will be secured in the future".
Toyota is unable to predict how long it will halt production, and warns that in the long run, additional costs will only reduce production competitiveness and jobs.
Peter Sowalris, the union director who worked at Barnstone for 24 years, said that unions are very concerned, "My experience is that jobs that were once lost are never restored.
A government spokesman stressed that "we will implement a precise and credible plan to establish a good relationship with the EU in the future".
According to a White House statement, Trump will postpone his meeting with Secretary Rosenstein.
A White House spokesman said Sunday that the meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a sensitive issue as the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kaverno continues, will be "delayed by one more week".
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump's support for Russia, and the possibility that the president might interfere with the implementation of post-election justice.
In the US political arena, rumors have been swirling for months about whether Trump's removal as deputy attorney general would make it impossible for Mueller's special counsel to be independently investigated.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Vice President Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a listening device to record conversations with President Trump and of removing him from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that the report was true.
Last Monday, amid reports that he was about to resign, Rosenstein went to the White House.
Instead of resigning, he announced that he would meet with Trump on Thursday, attending a United Nations conference in New York.
Trump stated that he "preferred not to prosecute" Rosenstein, and postponed the meeting to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where both Kavernov and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavernov of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the Cavernano sex scandal for a week, and postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Sanders' spokesman said, "The date is not set, and it could be this week, but given all the issues that are going on in the Supreme Court right now, it's likely to be postponed for the next one.
But the White House is still considering the situation and will keep you updated".
Some reporters may be uncomfortable with Sanders's statement, as he has not had a White House press conference since September 10.
And let's ask Chris Wheeler, the host, why he's not doing it.
Sanders said that he didn't like the "attractive behavior" of TV reporters, but that he didn't object to the fact that it was "attractive behavior".
He suggested that there would be more opportunities for the president and reporters to meet in person.
"Unlike the previous presidents who had formal Q&A sessions, President Trump is going to be frank about the issues", he said, adding that he was "looking at the facts", without providing any specific evidence.
He said that a press briefing was about to take place, and he said, "Wouldn't it be so much better if you could ask the President of the United States directly for me?
The White House is trying to have a conversation more often, and we've actually had a conversation in the last few weeks, and now, in the press briefing, you can have a conversation with the president of the United States".
President Trump has been asked questions periodically when he leaves the White House, or has an open session with his current staff, or has a press conference with his vice presidents.
I rarely have a press conference on my own.
This week in New York, President Trump may be able to explain his reasons freely to the press at a barbecue.
The Health Secretary sends a letter to the EU workers at NHS Scotland about the Brexit scare!
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to the NHS Scotland, expressing his gratitude to the EU staff and expressing his wish to continue working for them after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, wrote the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has decided to cover the costs of applying for settlement status for EU citizens already working in the public service sector.
The letter said: "We have continued negotiations between the UK and the EU, which were in a state of stagnation for a while during the summer, and in the coming days we will be able to decide on matters as planned.
But the British government is also preparing for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.
I know you're feeling very uneasy.
So I would like to once again express my humble and deep gratitude for the hard work of all the workers, regardless of their nationality.
Thanks to the valuable experience and expertise of our colleagues from the EU and other countries, we have improved the quality of healthcare and delivered more benefits to patients and communities.
Scotland is your safe haven, and we're eager for you to stay".
Christian Abercrombie, in emergency surgery after a head injury!
Tennessee State University's Mike Organ said that Christian Abercrombie, linebacker for the Tigers, was taken to emergency surgery after suffering a hamstring injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State University head coach Rod Reed told reporters he suffered a hamstring injury just before halftime.
"Christiane walked into the line and fell down", Reed added.
Before the trainer and paramedics could get him on the sideline, Abercrombie was put on an oxygen mask and taken to the hospital for further tests.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris that Abercrombie completed the surgery at the Bandbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "we have not yet heard any details about the type or extent of the injuries".
After his first season as a sophomore, Abercrombie transferred from Illinois to Tennessee State University.
He made a total of five tackles before being suspended for the season, recording 18 total tackles.
The British government, if foreigners buy property, will charge higher cognition taxes.
Under the new Tory rules, foreign investors who buy property in the UK will be charged an additional recognition tax and the money will be used for UK homeless people.
This decision will attract young voters and put a dent in the fragile Corbyn.
The tax will be levied on people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is raising £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign investors will be charged a higher recognition tax if they buy property in the UK, and the additional money will be used to help homeless people, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
This move is intended to counter the weakness of Jeremy Corbyn, who is supported by young voters, by promoting cheaper housing and attracting more senior voters.
The additional tax collections are for private investors and overseas institutional investors who do not pay taxes to the UK government, and the funds collected will be used to effectively address the problem of homelessness.
If you buy a house for one-family, two-family or rental purposes two years ago, you will be subject to a tax of up to 3% on your current income tax, including the imposition of a higher tax rate.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise an additional £120 million a year.
Foreign investors who do not reside in the UK are buying up about 13% of Newtown properties, causing a price shock to the housing market, making it difficult for residents to provide single family homes.
As foreign investors spend most of their time outside the UK, many wealthy areas, especially the capital, are becoming "ghost towns".
This policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson announced that he would drastically lower the tax on the first home purchases by young people.
He accused the real estate prices of rising as big business is clutching at straws after land acquisitions and urged Prime Minister May to ease restrictions on affordable housing to fix the "decomposed UK housing market".
Corbyn has announced a series of groundbreaking housing reforms, including the adjustment of rents and the end of the end of the term of office.
And I want to give the committee more authority in terms of building new housing.
The Prime Minister said, "Last year, during my term as Prime Minister, I said I would revive the British dream of ensuring a better life for the younger generation.
That means fixing the broken housing market.
The British government is open to anyone who wants to live, work, and secure asylum in the UK.
But it's not right that private investors who don't live in the UK, or foreign corporate investors, can easily buy property, and hard-working British citizens have a hard time buying a home.
The dream of owning a home is becoming more and more real, and more people are asking for a bed in a poor environment".
Jack Ross, the final goal for the Scotland captain.
Jack Ross, who was appointed manager of Sunderland, said his "ultimate goal" was to become Scotland manager at the right time.
The 42-year-old Scottish-born Ross is delighted to have lifted the North-East club, who are currently in first and third place in the First Division, with three points.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
Ross told BBC Scotland Sports Sound: "I wanted to play for my country as a driver.
But I was a top-class player, and I couldn't go any higher".
"I grew up watching my father and I playing the Scottish team in Hampden, and there was always something that attracted me.
Running a successful club is the only way to seize the opportunity".
Ross was previously managed by Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foyt and Paolo DiCanio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he could follow Ross, who had successfully led the club to relegation from Banstead and Goosewich Town, without any fear.
"My goal is to get the club back into the Premier League.
"Given the structure and facilities of this club, it's a Premier League club".
"It's not easy to get back into the Premier League, but I'm probably the only one who can say that it's been a success to get the club back", he added.
Ross was assistant manager at Dumbarton, after 15 months on the Hearts' coaching staff, and then only managed for three years.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren to the Championship the following season, when they were on the brink of relegation.
Ross, who has spent time at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy, said he was more comfortable than ever.
And he said, "That would have been a real turning point".
"I honestly believed that management was more appropriate than playing the game.
It might seem strange that I'm going to leave, having done quite well in the game, having enjoyed a pretty decent life, and having the honor to do so.
But it was too hard to play.
I had to do a lot of things every week.
I felt a lot of stress and pressure every time I went to the game, so I thought, well, the management is better for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, but I'm doing it now, and as an adult, I feel most comfortable doing the best job I can".
The full interview with Sports Sound on Friday 30 September can be heard on Radio Scotland from 12:00 - 13:00 (UK Summer Time).
Polls show that Saturday at 5:30 p.m. is the best time to drink a pint.
British pubs, which were in decline as the crowds broke through, saw sales rise, but franchised restaurants saw sales decline.
According to statistics, Pub & Bar's sales rose 2.7% in July, while the restaurant's sales declined 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who produced the figures, said, "As the weather continued to be hot and the England team was expected to dominate the World Cup, sales in July showed a similar pattern to the previous June, but the restaurant sales were down.
The restaurant's sales, which were down 1.8% in June, were even lower in July.
Pubna Bar, which is the main staple, has seen its best month-on-month sales increase, while restaurant sales have fallen.
Pubs, which are primarily food stalls, are not as classy as the cluster, but not as classy as the restaurant chain.
People want a light drink.
This month, all over the pub and bar, the mainstream sales went up 6.6 percent, and the food sales went down 3 percent".
Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Audience Analyst, noted that "after April, we expect these results to continue, based on the current situation".
Important social events, like weather, or sporting events, are the biggest factors that affect the revenue of the catering industry.
It is obvious that restaurants will continue to struggle in the future and the fall in revenue by 4.8% compared to the previous year is adding fuel to the cost problem.
The storm hit the food-store operators who were on the brink of collapse, and if the storm hits in August, we'll see if the sales increase as much as the school year".
The total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new locations, were 2.7% in July, which is delaying the opening of new locations.
Copper Pitch Tracker, which monitors the industry sales of the UK pub, bar and restaurant sectors, is collecting and analyzing performance data from 47 operating groups (over £9 billion in total revenue) to establish industry benchmarks.
One in five children have a social media account that their parents don't know about.
The survey found that at least one in five children aged 11 to 15 have a social media account hidden from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students found that fake Instagram pages are on the rise.
The fear of sexual content being posted is being heightened through the news.
20% of students said they had a Jio account that they showed their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, said they had a social media account that was secretly held by an adult.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students found that the number of students with fake Instagram accounts on Instagram sharing photos is increasing rapidly.
The fear of sexual content being posted is being heightened through the news.
20% of students have a "young" account that their parents would be happy with, and on the other hand, they have a private, secret account.
One mother happened to see her 13-year-old daughter on a secret website asking other teenagers to "sexually assault" her.
A study by Digital Awareness and the Independent Schools Organisation (HMC) found that 40% of pupils aged 11-18 had two accounts, half of whom admitted to having a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said, "The fact that many teenagers are looking for their own space online that parents and teachers can't find is a source of anxiety".
Eileen Doyle, the Scottish Athletic Commission's representative to the Athletes' Doctor.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the flight controller for the Scottish Athletic Council's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beatty sees this appointment as a great opportunity to fully exploit Doyle's extensive experience in international competition over the past decade.
"Ailrid is a highly respected figure in the athletic community in Scotland and the UK, and around the world, and I believe that by joining the committee now, athletes will benefit even more", added Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm going to be involved in delivering the doctors to the players and hopefully contribute to the development of Scottish sport and give a little bit of help".
An American who won two gold medals in the 200m and 400m freestyle at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a professional on the BBC, had to retire after suffering a stroke that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted, "I had a stroke a month ago.
It was impossible to walk.
The doctor said that it would take time to know how much he could recover.
It was really hard, but I had to fully recover and learn to walk again, and today I'm going to do some agility training.
Thank you so much for sending me a message of encouragement".
The controversial online commercial for the breeder, the analogy of a breastfeeding woman to a milkman?
An online controversy has erupted over a breastfeeding device manufacturer's ad comparing breastfeeding women to dairy cows.
Breastfeeding device manufacturer Elvy has released a somewhat obscene music video ad to express the freedom that the new breastfeeding device will bring to breastfeeding women, with the launch of "the world's first wearable silent breastfeeding device".
Four women who recently had a baby appear at the milk festival, dancing in the shade, and the lyrics on the soundtrack say, "Yeah, I'm milking myself, but you can't see the tail", and "Can't you see the breast? This is my breast".
The chorus continues, "Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, and then, let's go, and then, let's go, and then.
The ad was posted on Facebook and sparked a controversy online.
The video has been viewed more than 77,000 times and has received hundreds of comments, with mixed reactions, many of whom say it is a disaster for the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use milk to advertise this product.
Like humans, we have to water the milk, we have to milk it, and the difference is that we separate the calves within a few days of milking, and it's a bit of a mess.
The Elbi adapter can be attached directly without being visible on the inside of the underwear.
Another commented: "It is a given that this advertisement traumatizes breastfeeding women and babies.
But why not use it to advertise a breastfeeding device for women who don't need to lose their babies?"
Another comment read: "A disgusting advertisement!"
There are also comments defending the commercials for the breeders. One woman admitted that the ads were "fun".
"I think it's a very ingenious idea.
If I'm still breastfeeding, this is something I want to have.
Every time I was breeding, I felt like a complete suckling pig.
I thought it was a bit weird, but it was a reflection of reality.
It's a product where genius thrives".
And another commented, "I think this is a fun ad for breastfeeding women who think of themselves as a cow while they're breastfeeding in the office or the bathroom".
It's not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry".
The back of the ad shows women dancing with a bra attached.
The ad was based on the fact that many women who breastfeed think of themselves as dairy cows when they are milking.
The Elvy breastfeeder is completely noise-free, has no wires or tubes, and can be attached in a breastfeeding bra without being marked, so it can move freely and hold the baby and can even exit during breastfeeding.
Anna Vallarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, said, "The Elvy breeder is a groundbreaking product that should be launched in the world.
By showing breastfeeding women and their breasts at the same time, it illuminates the issues associated with breeding and shows in an interesting way how much freedom the new breastfeeding device guarantees.
This isn't the first time an Elvy breeder has made headlines.
During Launder Fashion Week, two breastfeeding women walked the walkway wearing designer Marta Yakubowski's clothes, with a breastfeeding device attached.
Hundreds of illegal immigrant children are being held in seclusion in Texas border detention centers.
While the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border each month has not changed significantly, the number of detained illegal immigrant children has skyrocketed, in part because the Trump administration has issued a ruthless security alert that makes it harder to connect children to sponsors.
Generally, most sponsors are afraid to take action because they are illegal immigrants and are more likely to be deported from the United States if they decide to take their children.
The risk of deportation increased in June when the U.S. Department of State announced that all adults associated with potential sponsors would be required to submit their fingerprints and share their fingerprint data with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Alvins, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that he had arrested dozens of applicants who had applied to sponsor orphans.
The enforcement agency later announced that 70% of the arrested applicants had no prior record.
"Nearly 80% of the refugees and their families are in the United States illegally, and a significant number of them are foreign criminals.
So we're going to keep tracking these illegal criminals", Alvins added.
According to the staff of the protection agency, in order to process children more quickly, the US administration introduced a new law that instead of waiting 60 days as usual, takes them to court within one month of their stay.
In many cases, instead of going to court directly, they use a virtual currency to answer the immigration counsel's questions about their legal status.
If they are not deemed to be a target of support, they are immediately forcibly deported.
The staff and the system have reported in recent months that the longer the time they are in detention, the more anxious and depressed they become, and the more they suddenly try to escape or attempt violent behavior.
Supporters said they were more concerned that in large facilities like Tornillo, the scale of the children's emotional symptoms was easier to ignore.
When children are not psychologically prepared, or when they don't greet their friends properly, and suddenly they're isolated in a shelter, they're traumatized in many ways.
Syria, which has demanded the immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey's occupation forces.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Almowaleem urged Syrian refugees to return to their homelands, even though the war has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign occupation forces are illegally staying in Syria under the pretext of a terrorist attack and that they will deal with the situation accordingly.
"Foreign occupying forces must be withdrawn immediately without any conditions", the UN General Assembly said.
Muallem claims that the "war on terror" in Syria is over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
The government of Damascus also added that it will continue this "sacred battle" until "terrorist groups and all illegal foreign occupation forces currently stationed in all Syrian territory are completely uprooted".
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops to Syria to train and advise mainly Kurds and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed 1,000 ground troops on war-torn Syrian soil.
On the refugee issue, he blamed the situation for improving enough to allow the return of refugees, and for creating an irrational panic in "some Western countries" that refugees are not returning to their homelands.
"I have asked the international community and human rights organizations to help the refugees return to their homeland".
"It's just a political issue about what's going to be dealt with as a human rights issue", said Minister Mu'alem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support reconstruction until Assad and the opposition agree politically to a ceasefire.
According to the UN representative, Russia and Turkey recently agreed to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, creating an opportunity to promote political talks.
Thanks to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, the area of 3 million people could not be attacked by the Russian-backed Syrian army.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has a clear deadline and hoped that the military operation would wipe out the jihadists of the Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaeda.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes the new committee, which will be composed of the government and the opposition, will draft a post-war constitution and prepare for elections in Syria.
Muallem put conditions on the committee for the Syrian government to participate, warning that government officials should be limited to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution and not interfere.
Why Trump Will Re-elect
And so, in that logic, Trump is likely to succeed on the premise that he will not step down with impeachment or impeachment, as many liberals hope, before the end of his term in 2020.
It will be the most dramatic end to the presidency of President Deng Xiaoping.
We can't pick up any signal of viewer fatigue at this time.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years earlier, and MSNBC's The X-Files Show attracted 3.5 million viewers in its prime-time newscast, achieving the highest ratings among cable channels.
Neil Bear, general manager of the ABC drama "The Untouchables", said "This is just a way to get people to understand it". "The Untouchables" is the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Congress's Democratic Party is destroyed by a raid.
Comedy writer and author of the hard truths of the story of the gang's only collection of funny parts and the sneak-in to the Hollywood Boys Club, Nell Scobel, presents a different theory.
Scobel recalled a taxi he had taken in Boston just before the 2016 election.
The article told her that they were going to shoot Trump.
She said, "Why?"
Scobel told me that the article said "Trump makes me laugh".
There is value in entertainment in the midst of chaos.
Of course, unlike anything on television, the story in Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Switching channels is a privileged audience's prerogative.
And yet, I'm seeing Bob Woodward's use of the deep background shadow, quoting from his book, The Flatbush, Paul Mannifort's $15,000 tambourine leather airplane jacket (the Washington Post called it a dress full of conceit), and Stomach Daniel's suggestion of Trump's, well, wild depiction of his body, all discussed by a panel of experts, and I feel like I'm crossing the line of civilized citizenship.
I'll never see Super Mario from the same perspective again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of the television series "The Phantom", said that Trump's behavior is like a reality show because he feeds the audience every day.
You can't miss an episode because you're stuck.
When I visited Mr. Plais this week, it was a sunny day on the north shore of Kaua'i, 80 degrees, and he was locked in his room watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't even see Brett Kaverno's fight with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court on the final day of the trial.
Mr. Fleiss remembers that when we used to do a ridiculous show, people would say, "Oh, the end of Western civilization is here".
I thought it was a joke, but I knew it was true.

External funding, the most powerful parliamentary elections, the midterm elections, the midterm elections, the midterm elections, the midterm elections, the midterm elections, the midterm elections.
It's no surprise that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is getting funding, because the redistricting of the congressional districts means that the two incumbents are fighting for the same seat.
The recent redistricting has seen the incumbent, Conor Ram, who won a special election in another district last spring, go on to win.
Ram is pitted against incumbent Republican Rep. Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former Pennsylvania 12th District. The 12th District is heavily overlapped with the 17th District.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's ruling in January, the newly drawn map was delegitimized to suit Republican tastes.
The campaign for the new 17th District has sparked a financial standoff between the Democratic Electoral Campaign Council (DCCC) and the Republican National Electoral Campaign Council (NRCC), the major party's financial backbone.
Ram became famous after winning the March by a narrow margin in the high-profile Pennsylvania 18th District special congressional election.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts say the Democrats will be a little bit dominant.
The US is backing China in its efforts to impose sanctions on El Salvador.
Diplomats have witnessed the fact that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized China without any American objection.
Trump held a peaceful meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Barrera in June 2017, and kept a hotel in Panama until his business associates fired the Trump corporate management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the top US diplomatic missions in the Dominican Republic, Panama, and El Salvador, following the recent decision by State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert earlier this month not to recognize Taiwan.
However, the sanctions were only targeted at El Salvador, which received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 in the form of drug trafficking, development and economic assistance.
Sanctions included the removal of financial aid and visa restrictions, which would have been a painful experience for El Salvador, which is facing high unemployment and murder rates.
With internal meetings continuing, officials in North and Central America decided to postpone a high-level meeting focused on security and economics similar to last year's meeting, which appeared to be a step forward in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
However, in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, effectively blocking the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was recommended to speak at the meeting, which was scheduled for mid-October, and diplomats said it would show the importance the government attaches to the talks.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any ruthless remittances or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussions described by the three U.S. ambassadors, two of whom agreed to discuss internal decisions under the guarantee of anonymity.
An outside expert who is closely connected to the administration and who has also agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity has confirmed their explanation.
The history of research
The possibility of Trump's judicial obstruction, as presented by special counsel Robert Mueller, may be inevitable. Considerable evidence of this has been gathered through official records.
Muller has reportedly launched an investigation to determine whether Russia colluded with Trump's campaign to disrupt our election.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be accused of being responsible for the core of the case just before he stands before voters in the re-election, and he may be in a position to be a jury of his peers.
This is a "if" -filled imagination, and the fact that Trump's fall is unconditional doesn't mean that the same thing will happen in Europe, of course.
Both sides, which are holding the Atlantic in their midst, have a choice to determine the continuity of this situation.
In 1938, German officers completed preparations for a coup against Hitler, which would have been successful if the West had continued to resist Hitler and support Czechoslovakia.
But we failed, and we missed the chance to stop the slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these tipping points, where the progress of unbroken democracy can be accelerated or slowed.
Americans are at a turning point in history.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who could have derailed Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since the newspaper reported last year that he had secretly recorded the president's speech and assumed he was not fit to be president.
Rosenstein said the Times's account was inaccurate.
What would we do if the FBI investigation of Hubert Caverno was inadequate or unjust, or if the Supreme Court acquitted her despite credible allegations of false testimony and sexual assault?
And above all, will you vote in the midterm elections for Congress, holding Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will fall into a bitter winter.
But I believe that the lessons of Prague will not fail us.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, where I was once an ambassador, and was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied Czechoslovakia.
My mother survived, and 60 years after immigrating to the United States, the Nazis sent me to turn on the Sabbath candle on a table with a painting of the culture of the Manchus.

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers, a very optimistic opponent ahead of Raphitt Beane.
Rangers face home team Lafitte Bean on Thursday. Rangers know that if they win against Austria in this match, following their amazing draw against Spanish side Viaregall earlier this month, they can lay a solid foundation for their entry into the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance was sidelined for the first time in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal with a knee injury, but he believes Rangers can achieve greater things based on these results.
"We had a good scoring situation because we had a good team in Pamplona", said the 31-year-old.
We believed we could do something, we went into the stadium, we scored.
I don't know if I could have scored more points at the end, but overall, the draw was fair.
I think Vialreal was probably better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
On Thursday, the big game of the Europa League will once again take place.
The hope is that we get three points, but Viareggio is going to be a tough game because we did well in the last game, but if we work with the fans on the pitch, we can make positive results with all our strength.
Last year was definitely tough because of personal injuries and changes at the club, but now the club is quite satisfied.
The team is in good shape, the players are enjoying themselves, and the training is good.
I hope we can move forward and forget about last season and make it work.
Women, you can't sleep because you're worried about your old-age fund.
Although the respondents had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, very few of them talked about it with their families.
In a nationwide survey, half of the respondents said they talk to their spouse about long-term care services.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children.
Holly Snyder, president of the National Life Insurance Corporation, said that the Yankees want their families to take care of them, but they don't try to talk.
This is how you start a conversation.
Tell your spouse and children: If you don't have enough time to talk about what you want, you don't have enough time to prepare for caregiving.
Talk to your family and your child about where and how you're going to get care, because these choices are a big factor in how much you're going to get care.
Bring financial advice: If you have advice, you can help to arrange for care costs.
Funding for long-term care services can be provided through long-term care insurance policies, cash value mixed life insurance policies, or if money is sufficient, the expenses can be covered by personal capital.
Make sure you're dealing with legal paperwork: avoid legal disputes.
Set up a health insurance agent, get a trusted individual to oversee health care services, and get the experts to follow your lead in case communication is impossible.
Also, consider hiring a power of attorney for financial management.
Choose someone you trust to make financial decisions, and don't let your salary slip when you can't live normally.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine an elderly parent on his way to the hospital for a medical emergency.
Can you answer your parents' questions about medications and allergies?

Martin countered that the judicial aspects of the case were not only important, but also who the doctor was.
"What medication do you have?

The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police are seeking witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications at a standstill, rescue workers were unable to obtain any information about the Donggala area north of Palo, closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people in Fallujah fled the disaster.
Some important facts about the Palau and Donggala areas of Sulawesi are as follows:
It is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Region, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi. The population of the city is about 379,800 as of 2017.
Fallujah was hit by an earthquake and tsunami during the celebration of the city's 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency extending 300 km (180 mi) along the coast of the northwestern region of Sulawesi.
The prefecture is one administrative step below the provinces. The population of Donggala was about 299,200 as of 2017.
Agriculture and fishing are the main industries in the central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala region.
Nickel mining is also important within the province, but is concentrated in Morowali on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the last 100 years have seen the worst tsunamis in the country's history, including the Fallujah and Donggala.
In 1938, the Tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami in the western region of Donggala killed nine people.
Indonesia is geologically located in the Pacific volcanic zone and is often affected by earthquakes.
The major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently are:
2004: On December 26, a threatening earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, North Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that devastated 14 countries and killed 226,000 along the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of these deaths came from Aceh Province.
2005: Strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, and causes a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hits the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh Province, causing unrest among people who recall the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but over 100 people died when buildings collapsed.
2018: A threatening earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist resort of Lombok, killing more than 500 people. Most of the damage occurred in the north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son, arrested for domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Track Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Track Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, harassment and resisting arrest, police said in a report released Saturday.
According to police reports, a woman who knew the woman reported to the police and tried to report the charges, and Palin stole her phone.
Palin is currently being held in the Matanuska-Sustina Pre-Psychiatric Facility and is tied to a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He also appeared in court on Saturday to declare his innocence.
Palin could face a maximum of three Class A misdemeanors, a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently pending before the Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
Palin's girlfriend claimed he had priced her face.
In 2016, Palin was accused by a group of veterans of her son's violent behavior, saying it was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, a psychological trauma resulting from his experience in the Iraq war.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are paralyzed and the death toll is expected to rise within days.
The quake passed slightly over the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video of the shock is circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered in Palo to enjoy the beach festival when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors, a rare attempt at a death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terror attacks.
Federal prosecutors in New York are considering a death sentence for Seppulloh Sypoff, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people. This is a rare case of a federal crime in New York State that has not been carried out since 1953.
According to the indictment, 30-year-old Sypoff used a Home Depot rental truck to hit a pedestrian and bicyclist who were driving on the Lower Manhattan Westside Highway.
According to a plea agreement filed by the prosecution in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death sentence, the prosecution must prove that Sypoff deliberately killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted lethal wounds.
According to court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the incident, a federal grand jury indicted Sipoff on 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, violent assault, and car destruction, which federal prosecutors often bring up in planned criminal cases.
Prosecutors said the raid would have required careful planning and deliberation, describing Saipoff's criminal style as "extreme, brutal and depraved".
In the wake of the death of his father, Habibullevich Saipov brought injuries, damage, and death to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Anhelini, Nicholas Clevès, Anne-Loire Decardt, Deron Drake, Ariel Irrig, Hernán Perucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pegnuko.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District Court of New York passed a death sentence.
Defendant Khalid Bans was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Essel Rosenberg, who were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saifov, a native of Uzbekistan, has not shown remorse for the long time since the incident.
Police noted that Syphoff told investigators that he felt better about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Szipoff told authorities that he had seen ISIS videos on his phone and that he had the idea to commit the crime.
According to police, Saipov also requested that ISIS flags be flown at the hospital.
He denied 22 counts of theft.
David Patton, one of the lawyers representing Sypoff, said that his lawyers were frankly disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of release and trying to get people to admit to the charges, trying to get the death penalty will only exacerbate the wounds of everyone involved", he added.
Saipoff's lawyers asked the former prosecutor not to carry out the death sentence.
The Conservative MP, Naidu Parrish, says he should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Naidu Parage vowed to activate the People's Army during a protest at the Conservative Party's meeting place today.
Former British Independence Party leader Parragh said politicians must feel the heat of opposition to the EU, to the point where one member of Theresa May's cabinet says he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bourne told protesters in Birmingham that if Parragh was the Brexit minister, Britain would have left with a bang.
But Prime Minister May is finding it difficult to unite a cabinet that is severely divided, with the European Union's remaining conservative faction taking part in anti-Brexit protests.
Prime Minister May is working hard to get the deal with the EU on track, amid continued attacks from the pro-Brexit, the anti-Brexit and the EU.
May's allies advised her to keep pushing for negotiations with the European Union headquarters in Brussels despite the backlash, and to make the Labour and EU opposition parties choose between her negotiating proposal and the Pyongyang.
The MP said at a rally in Solihull that the withdrawal would mean a withdrawal and that he wanted to scrap the agreement with the EU.
He said he should have taken Parag as a partner and given him authority in negotiations with the European Union headquarters in Brussels.
He said that if Pamela had been the CEO, we would have already resigned.
Bonn, MP for Wellingberger, also added: "We will fight for Brexit, but first we have to abandon the deal with the EU.
He voiced his opposition to the European Union, saying that the United States did not fight a world war to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
The MP denied that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, saying that it was completely wrong that the people of the United Kingdom had changed their opinion to the EU's remainder.
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative MEP, also took part in the protest and told reporters: "I'll be blunt: Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Prime Minister's deal has lost popularity among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, and it is not popular within the Conservative Party and even among the activists who took to the streets to elect us in the first place.
Please, cancel the deal and listen to the people.
In addition, through her remarks to Prime Minister May, she added that it is law that the Prime Minister can only hold the post of Prime Minister if he keeps his promise.
At the rally, Parazzi said that if politicians betray the 2016 referendum, they will feel the heat.
He added that the issue of corruption is a problem that affects us, the people, and our political class.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here to tell the people that we're betraying them and we're not going to get away with it.
In his statement to his ardent supporters, he hopes that you will show a taste of the heat of our political class just before it betrays Brexit.
We will mobilize the people's forces that have brought this country the victory of Brexit and will never stop until we are an independent, self-governing and proud Commonwealth.
Meanwhile, the EU Remainers have staged a protest in central Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally.
After the Remainers' march began, some of the activists waved their arms at the Conservative Brexit manifesto.
Labour's senior secretary Adonis held a rally to insult the Conservatives over the security issues of the party's app.
The people who said that the Cheyenne could put all the information technology systems and all the other technologies in Canada, that there would be no friction borders, free trade with Ireland and no borders, etc.
It's a lot of nonsense.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren, I'm going to run for office.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, shared his plans with the town council in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Trump, is running for re-election in 2016 against Republican state representative Jeff Deal, who was co-chairman of the Trump campaign.
Warren is currently being considered as Trump's opponent in the 2020 election.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was Warren's 36th town meeting, using the town council system that has been in place since Trump's election.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run.
Warren replied that it was time for the woman to go to Washington and get to the top and fix the broken government.
Suspect arrested in Louisiana State University shooting that killed Sims.
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana say they have arrested a suspect in the Friday shooting death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Ditton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. on ET News.
ET News released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said that Sims suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head and died as a result, according to Per 247 Sports.
Wade tried to protect his friend, but Simpson shot him.
Simpson was present at the scene during the interrogation, and he was in possession of a weapon, and confessed to firing at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims is a 6'6" basketball player from Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games last season, making 10 starts, averaging 5.6 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 17.4 minutes per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton, team leader, replacing Sebastian Petel as the world champion spider.
Since Valter Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has been clear that Mercedes' team order will be a major factor in the race.
From the start, Bottas had a good start, keeping the lead for the first two laps, and calling in Pettel to attack his teammate Hamilton, who seemed to be dropping him.
Pettel got into the station first and let him run at the end of the crowd, which was a bit more careful.
Hamilton came into the stop after one lap, but after a fierce confrontation between the two cars, the Ferrari driver was unable to get out of the front, and was at risk of resistance after a double-action at the third gearbox.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the field on his 21st birthday and finished seventh in the first lap.
After most of the race, she held onto her tyres and led the race, allowing her to see a quick finish line pass, and at the same time, she overtook Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He finally got to the stop on lap 44, but couldn't get up the pace for the remaining eight laps, and Reichnen regained fourth.
The Vivaldi was excellent all weekend and it was a tough day to be so gentlemanly that I could pass.
Our team finished first and second, and we had a very good performance", said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump publicly mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally last Saturday, claiming she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blaisdell Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kaverno of sexual assault.
Trump did not directly address Ford's testimony at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting in West Virginia, where he accused the current Senate proceedings of "showing well the hot, messy, untruthful people".
"The thing that's been going on in the Senate these past few days, and the beautiful thing is, when you see the anger, you see people who are angry and jealous and stubborn and not honest", he said.
And you see the leaks and the leaks, and you say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Did you get a leak on Senator Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer -- did you leak the documents? "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
"We leaked... No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against the Caverno nominee, which was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied the letter was leaked from his office.
The Hill newspaper reported that a member of Parliament, Feinstein, had argued in the Senate that "Dr. Ford did not conceal her claims.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, as she asked.
But Trump did not accept Sen. Feinstein's assertion, saying at a Saturday meeting that "it was really bad body language".
She might not, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee who is being accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these accusations for their own purposes.
They're trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You'll see how miserable and miserable they are, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to take down to get power and dominance", Trump said, according to Medium.
The Dundee Stars win the league 5-3 over the Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against the Dundee Stars.
The Dundee Stars won 5-3 in their second game against the Belfast Giants at Dundee on Saturday, and were relieved of their duties following their defeat in the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants on Friday.
The Giants took a two-goal lead in the first half with strikes by Patrick Dewyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie added goals for the home team Dundee Stars before Dewar recovered the Giants' lead and tied the game.
François Bouchard added a point before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured the win, allowing Dundee to tie the Giants.
It was the third Elat League defeat of the season for Adam Kipp's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
Dundee and the Giants won their fourth game of the season, and the Giants have won their last three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the third minute, 35 minutes into the game, with the help of Kendall McPaul, and four minutes later, Bobille, assisted by David Rutherford, doubled the score.
Sullivan helped the home side to take the lead at 13:10 in the early stages of the game, and Connie scored the equaliser at 15:16 with the help of Matt Marquardt.
The Dwyers scored their second goal of the night, and the Giants held the lead until the first half.
The home team took the lead and Bushar once again tied the game with a power play goal at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Coran helped Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the second half, and he led the team to victory in the mid-season finale.
The Giants, who have played four of their last five games, will play their next game Friday at home against Milton Keynes.
Hundreds of passengers are trying to escape the quake, air traffic controller dead.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has died trying to help a plane carrying hundreds of people safely land. He is being hailed as a hero.
A major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, followed by a tsunami, killing more than 800 people and leaving many missing.
Strong earthquakes continue to damage the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of Pallu City.
But despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Arang refused to leave the control tower of the heavily shaken Mutiara Siss Al Jufri Airport, Pallu Airport.
He remained on the runway to ensure that Battic Air 6321 could take off safely.
He jumped from the traffic control tower thinking it was falling down.
He later died in hospital.
Australian broadcaster ABC reported that Johannes Sirah, a spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Authority, said his decision would have saved hundreds of lives.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balipapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
It breaks my heart to hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, access to Donggala, Giga, and Bungalow is restricted. Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands.
A spokesman for the Sotofo Puruu Ngoroho Disaster Relief Agency said: "The death toll seems to be still rising, many bodies are still under rubble and it is difficult to recover the bodies".
Waves of up to 6m have swept across the city of Palo. A massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are importing relief supplies and materials.
The mother, Kusuma Lisa, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes to pick up the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small bushes are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelpand, the head of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Society (IRC) in Indonesia, told CNN in an interview that "the Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there".
It's already tragic, but it could get a lot worse".
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo Alto on 23 and issued the following instructions to the military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related missions".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
More than 550 people have been killed in an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, earlier this year.
A man has gone missing after a plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean, according to Air New Guinea.
The airline said one person was missing after the plane crashed into a reef in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, and the remaining 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
Air New Guinea said in a press release on Saturday afternoon that it could not find a male passenger at the moment.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details such as the identity or nationality of the passengers.
After the passenger plane was submerged while attempting to land at the Irish airfield, local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said seven passengers were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, the exact sequence of events, is still unclear.
Both the Air Force and the Navy said the plane landed on the reef before it hit the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane came in very low.
"It was really a good thing", said Mr. Jains.
Mr. Jaines said he and others managed to walk through the waist-deep water and into the emergency compartment of the sinking plane.
The panicked crew members were screaming, and he said he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water, sailors working on the pier sent people ashore using expansion boats that could carry me to help with the rescue operation.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), 111 people have died in PNG registered airline crashes over the past 20 years, but there have been no accidents related to Air New Guinea.
The analyst described the time of night when the woman was seen burning alive.
Prosecutors took a break Saturday from re-trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert in intelligence analysis at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours.
Roulette used cell phone records to explain to the jury how she had identified the vomiting of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis on the night of the death of 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
According to Clarion Ledger, Roulette received location information from several cell phones, and the fact that Telles was with Chambers that evening contradicts his earlier claims.
And the cell phone data analysis showed that during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, he was actually with Chambers, and the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on the stand Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tells was telling the truth about his statement that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He's lying about my truck being in Nashville".
Another paradox is that Tallis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
According to their cell phone records, they've only known each other for a week.
Roulette said that after Chambers died, Tallis deleted Chambers's text messages, phone calls, and contacts from his phone.
"I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let you go".
The defendants will begin their final hearing on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be returned to the jury later that day.
What is high-end, racially conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based High Breed argues that hip-hop has moved away from its original focus on political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop, and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Fuji and Kerman have been revived in the UK recently through artists such as Akala and Rookie.
Another black man?!
New York-based nanny sues for dismissal in connection with a racially offensive letter
A New York nanny is suing the couple for racial discrimination after receiving a misconfigured text from her mother, who complains that she is "another black".
The couple described the case as "a robbery" and said they were not racist.
Lindsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed embarrassment at the fact that her foster mother, Giselle Morris, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman sent a message to her husband saying, "No more black people".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
The New York Post reported that after the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman realized his mistake, firing Morris, saying that the active black nanny was not doing her job properly and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Morris was sent home by Uber for a day's pay.
Morris is currently seeking compensation from the couple in connection with the dismissal. Although there is no formal contract, he is seeking compensation for his initial employment, which was for $350 a day for six months as a nanny.
She added in an interview with the Friday Post: "I want to show them that they shouldn't do this, and I know it's discrimination".
The couple refuted the claim that they were racist, saying it was only fair to fire Morris because they feared she would be unreliable after displeasing her.
"He sent me a text I didn't mean to.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, "said her husband, Joel Plasco, in an interview with The Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who you've been disrespectful to by mistake?
What about the newborn?
Please.
"Mr. Plasco likened this case to a case of a miscarriage of justice, where his wife had just given birth and was in a very difficult situation".
"Would you hire him?
That's not a good thing", added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case was still ongoing, the court quickly condemned the couple through SNS, rebuking their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers were concerned that readers might not empathize with the bear, a new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to understand the attitude of someone who first reads it before it is published.
For those of us who know about Paddington's tremendous success, it's just fascinating.
Her father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was inspired to write a children's book after seeing a little toy bear. She said that her father was optimistic about his work and could not have predicted that it would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which came after her father's death last year, was "sad and sweet".
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family", saying that her father was proud of the ultimate success of the work, but was not overly excited.
She said that he was a rather quiet man, and he was not a man who liked to whine.
"But Paddington felt so real to him, like having a child who had accomplished something, something you didn't really do, but you were proud of them.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always threw the ball at Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but failed.
Ms. Ednan Rapperhouse said, "Nad called regularly and said it was very bad, that she was going to be very difficult to live".
"Then I got a call from Nad, and he said she was going to die in two minutes.
And I said,
I love you so much, Chantash".
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors had injected her with to keep her heart beating was slowly disappearing and leaving her system.
She died a while ago, and it was all coming to an end.
I knew all this was going on, but I just had to sit and wait.
Surrounded by her family and people, she couldn't cry or scream or cry.
I had to be really patient to get myself out".
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan Rapperhouse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, and unaware of the ordeal she was going through, boarded the plane along with the other passengers.
She said that no one knew.
"I was bowing my head, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane, and I felt a strong compassion for Nad that I couldn't resist.
That you needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
A card to stop women from committing suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent another person from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting up cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Wales Bridge to encourage people to ask for help.
Davis' son Tyler began suffering from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
I wish no parent would feel the way I do every day, she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They said his smile had warmed up some room".
But he was in a really dark place, and he gave up his job before he died".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, first discovered his brother who had committed suicide.
"I'm worried that the domino effect will continue to occur".
Mr. Davis made a card, "To let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, including friends.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk".
Humphries, who had been friends with Davis for several years, lost his partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
She said that he hadn't told her that he was feeling bad or depressed.
"Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was in a state of abject depression. He didn't look the children in the eye when they opened their presents on Christmas Day.
She said that his death was a huge emotional shock to them, but they had to get over it, because it was a hole in the family's heart.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

As the FBI began its investigation, Brett Caverno's future became unclear.
If what he had asked for, such as a time-limited, scope-limited investigation, were actually done, it could bring some unity, Plek said Saturday, fearing that the committee would "overwhelm" in a party-driven stalemate.
Why would Mr. Caverno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They're all timing them out.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6, and if the Republicans don't campaign as expected, it will have a serious impact on their efforts to elect him to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called on senators to support Cavern. Cavern worked in the White House for President Bush, and through President Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI writes the report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear yet if Cavernano will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, and if he does, Vice President Mike Pence will cast one vote to confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors under Kim Jong-un is 'down'
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of defectors entering South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park said that last year there were 1,127 defectors, compared to 2,706 in 2011, citing South Korea's Unification Ministry.
Park said the main factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the impression of the amount demanded by the companies that help with the de-Korean.
North Korea has not made any public comments about this.
Most defectors from North Korea eventually receive Korean citizenship.
The South Korean government says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are defecting through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China often considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and forcibly returns them.
In fact, relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for a meeting focused on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where Trump and Kim agreed to work extensively on denuclearization.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Li Yongho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Yousafzai said that if there is no trust in the United States, there is no certainty about our national security, and in such a situation, there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm first.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Caverno "neurotic", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House of Representatives Chief Justice Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavern a "neurotic" Supreme Court nominee, saying she was "geologically unfit to serve on the Supreme Court".
Pelosi said this in an interview with the Texas Triangle Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday and said of Caverno's testimony, "I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say 'neurotic.'"
Caverno emotionally denied the suspicion that he had sexually assaulted the doctor, who was both a teenager and Christine Blasey Ford.
At the opening, Cavernot was very emotional about his family and his high school days, sometimes almost screaming and even choking.
He also blamed the Democratic members of the committee around him, calling their arguments "a pointless and organized assassination of the personality" by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 election defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Caverno's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
She thinks he fired himself with such statements and his attitude of blaming Clinton and the Democrats, she said.
Pelosi questioned whether he would try to impeach Caverno if he was confirmed, if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only ineligible to sit on the Supreme Court, he's not eligible to sit on the court he's currently working on", said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi, a Democrat, added that he was concerned that Cavernano would make a hostile ruling on the former president's Affordable Care Act or the Road vs. Wade decision, because Cavernano is viewed as conservative.
Cavorno avoided questions about whether he would reverse the Supreme Court ruling at a public hearing.
"This is not the time for a nervous, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'I'm not that great,'" said Pelosi.
And women have to overcome it.
It was a just criticism of months and continuing anger, and she couldn't say it without crying.
We were mad and then we got mad, and 45 years later, Mr. Steele told me,
It's not uncommon, is it?
She goes on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was somewhere in the middle, and she said that she cried when she was angry, but she developed this technique: If she starts to cry and get angry, she might tell the person she's talking to that she thinks that she's sad because she's crying.
I'm going to make a mistake.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are partly allowed as an outlet for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of my early career in the men's office is when I was shedding tears of indescribable anger when an elderly woman grabbed my collarbone and led me down the stairs, a cool manager I always dreaded a little.
She told me that she never let anyone see you cry.
"They don't know you're mad.
They'll sue you because they think you're sad, because they think they're harassing you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado House of Representatives, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, Hart was involved in a scandal involving a ship called Monkey Business, and she gave up the race. At that point, Schroeder was deeply frustrated. She felt that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a decision made after careful thought", she said, smiling 30 years later.
"There were seven more candidates in the race, and the one thing they didn't need most was another candidate.
Someone called it the White-tailed Princess and the Seven Dwarfs".
She was pushed out of the fundraising drive because she started her campaign late, so she vowed not to run unless she raised two million dollars.
It was a fight.
She realized that some of her supporters who would give $1,000 to male competitors would only give her $250.
"Would they think I could get less?" she wondered.
When she announced she would not run for office, she was overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult, frustration with the system that made it harder to target voters rather than deputies, and anger at sexism.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", said Schroeder, recalling how the press reacted to her behavior.
"I would have thought Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they thought they were going to write on my headstone.
I heard her crying.
How the trade war will help Beijing.
The start of the trade war between the United States and China seemed to be a long way off, but experts say the rift between the two countries could be detrimental to China in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important milestone this week was the imposition of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which would tax half of all goods coming into the US from China.
China has retaliated in the same way every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is not likely to be surprised anytime soon.
While Washington's submission means accepting the demands of the United States, publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if China can make the best use of the options available to it, the U.S. trade war pressure could reduce the interdependence of the two economies and work in China's favor in the long run.
The fact that quick political decisions in Washington or Beijing could create a situation that could trigger an economic crisis in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged, said Abigail Grace, Asia researcher at the New America Security Center, a think tank.
The Secretary of State says the repatriation of Syrian refugees is complete.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem told the UN General Assembly that the situation in Syria was improving.
"Today, with the progress in the war on terror, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure", he said.
The government continues to evacuate residents to restore normalcy to areas devastated by terrorists.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are now in place, who have had to leave Syria because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled abroad since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Minister al-Mu'alem said he would welcome the Syrian government to help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not receive any conditional support or help from the countries that supported the war.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team defeated the United States 16.5 to 10.5 in the 2018 Ryder Cup final at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight Ryder Cup tournaments in Europe and has not won in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown with a team led by Danish captain Thomas Beecham, who scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, dropped a teesot at the 16th hole of the third, giving the win to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari is one of only four players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament's current rules were implemented in 1979, shining a light in every round.
Jordan Spice of the United States defeated the European team's lowest placed Danish player, Tobi Olesen, 5-4 in the final.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Potter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has scored a career-high 25.5 points, making him the European player with the most wins in the competition.
"I'm not crying, but I can't help it today.
It was a tough year.
Thomas picked me, and I'm so grateful for his trust.
So happy, I'm so happy to get my trophy back.
"It's for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, who was moved by the team's European title".
He presents a statue to Spanish golfer John Lamb, who defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a Sunday fasting match.
I'm so proud to be able to say that I watched Tiger Woods play, and I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has been eliminated in four Ryder Cup matches in France and currently has a total Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
The second most 14 major titles, except Jack Nicklaus, but a weird statistic written by one of the greatest players of all time.
The U.S. team, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Pinaud, who played high-powered golf throughout the tournament, worked tirelessly to send the ball to fairway throughout the weekend.
And the captain of the United States, Jim Furyk, said, despite the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these players. They fought.
This morning we had a little bit of pressure on Europe.
We were defeated.
I pay my respects to Thomas.
He's a great team leader.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to refinance the team and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to show respect.
The other team played better".
Redfish concentrations are declining in Pine, Manate, and Sarasota.
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that redfish concentrations are generally declining in some areas of Tampa Bay.
The commission says red fox are being observed in the craters of Pineapple, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating that concentrations are declining.
The Red Sea stretches along a coastline of about 130 miles from Pineiras in the north to Lee County in the south.
The redwood fragments were found about 10 miles away in Hillsborough County, but in a smaller area than last week.
Red eagles have also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, Pinnacle County reported moderate concentrations, Hillsborough County reported low or high concentrations, Manatee County reported near-peak or high concentrations, Sarasota County and coastal counties reported near-peak or high concentrations, Charlotte County reported near-peak or medium concentrations, Lee County and coastal counties reported near-peak or high concentrations, and Collier County reported low concentrations.
Respiratory illness continues to be reported in Pine Ridge, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
No respiratory illness was reported in northwest Florida last week.
