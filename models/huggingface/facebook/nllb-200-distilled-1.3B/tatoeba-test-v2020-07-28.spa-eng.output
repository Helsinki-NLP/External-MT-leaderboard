When we die, we will be alone. Of all our earthly possessions we are about to leave.

Of those bound to us by stronger ties - our relatives, our loved ones, our children, brothers, sisters, and others no less dear to us who have become our friends because they and we are friends of the same Savior - of them we must also leave. Though not everything will leave us. One must "remain closer than a brother" - One who, having loved His own who are in the world, loves them to the end.

The place was as wild as the center of a thick forest.
