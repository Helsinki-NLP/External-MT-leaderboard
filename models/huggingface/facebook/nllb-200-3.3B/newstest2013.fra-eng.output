Republican strategy to counter Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat voter fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, regards the latter as a myth, claiming that voter fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in the last decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on participation rates.
In this sense, these measures will undermine in part the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the US states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments enacted new laws beginning in 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
These laws also shorten early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deprive citizens with criminal records of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to produce a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
In the last two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
But it often costs more than $100 to get the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income individuals.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
More than that.
Students, voters considered to be more likely to vote for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their institution-issued photo ID.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs that vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
But it turns out that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 sponsored legislation abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters seeking to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register some 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states to shorten the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted early were African-Americans, while African-Americans made up only 13% of the state's electorate.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
They represented only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in anticipation.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of the electorate only accounted for 46% of the early voters.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by Democratic governors' vetoes.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to contain some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have been put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see them as an obvious objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new arrangements will have a negative influence on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening - Should You Get It or Not?
The APS test may give false negative or false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This may make men who are already reluctant to take a test even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We consulted two experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of cross-contamination between the control groups, so it's difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up of 12 years, that you have a 30 to 40 percent higher chance of having metastases if you're not screened.
So I recommend testing at age 50, or at age 40 if you have a direct relative who's had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we detect cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer, by offering them the options available, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, and by opting, in those cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We'll suggest active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we'll offer treatment.
Increasingly, criteria are being defined precisely to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend you take the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be passed.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that allows the evaluation of the pros and cons of the APS test.
The document can be downloaded (in English for the time being, a translation will be available soon) at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the best way to reduce the risk of developing diabetes is to adopt healthy lifestyle habits.
It's estimated that if everyone ate right and got enough exercise, we could prevent 30 percent of cancers.
"If everyone stopped smoking, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Society continues to make tobacco control a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It's very bad for people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, says the CCS.
It is said to increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life is protective against colon cancer", it adds.
The food supply
The agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
So are carcasses, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"These can damage cells in the body and lead to cancer", it says.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not yet conclusive.
Studies on vitamin E are conflicting, according to the SCC.
While one showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"You can't get cancer by having a blood test".
The Higgs boson peeled
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It's believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more.
And then, it's the last particle that the Standard Model predicts exists - our best, or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's not yet entirely certain that it's the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we're holding a genuinely new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Let's assume it's the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is.
There is a law in this world, a law that cannot be circumvented, that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
Now, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it too has a law of this sort: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then split into two groups, according to the (very extraordinary) site The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be noted here, are not all as exotic beetles as you might think.
In fact, if you are able to read this column, it is because of a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" comes an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
Field more stable
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond that only a very large rock could ride on.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 17 miles in circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles, not all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold up on its own in a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, you know) don't.
Now, what "can" all this research "bring", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and the SM's predictions.
Many of them are very keen to find them, because the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" and close some holes in the Model.
It is true that the theory is still very flawed, offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (ouch!).
But we haven't found such discrepancies at CERN until now.
The consequences
The repercussions of this research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. All-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960's, the laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would unleash.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already heard from the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - that the laser was originally seen as a "lab gadget".
Can you imagine that?
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light detector in 1969 during his work in optics.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and it won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care-- the best way to die-- is to have it.
With its Commission on Dying with Dignity, Quebec has recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
But in this vital area, much remains to be done.
Duty tried to look at it more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
He had two years of relief from the prostate cancer that was eating away at him.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven", he said, half-figure, half-grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it", he said.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Overwhelmed by a delicious lunch, he accepts help to eat, resigned to the situation.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who rush around him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhoea, it's humiliating", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"We learn in our lifetime that a man urinates standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois firm.
To regress to the childhood stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the regression, he says.
Because, according to many people who work in palliative care, great moments are happening at the heart of this regression.
The patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois hospice are all suffering from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of three months at most.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the illness has brought me to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no wishes in life", she said, before agreeing to be fitted with a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for her son to come from Italy in the next few days.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
It's palliative care, which is given when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's not much when you know that we're all going to die someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Whether it's physical comfort, emotional comfort, or spiritual comfort.
When you're dying, we'll agree to provide mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on your request.
Diabetics will no longer have to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who passed away during the night.
This morning, it's his son who'll finish the beer at the dead man's feet.
"We help the relatives as well as the patients", says Nathalie Savard, the director of the clinic.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, days follow one another but are not the same.
A 93-year-old man enjoys his last family gathering in the backyard, cuddled up in his pillows, and a toast is given to him. A 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds have been occupied by cancer patients under 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems of access to palliative care
It is said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is care designed to alleviate the suffering of a terminally ill patient, whether at home, in a hospital, or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that makes several doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by leading figures in palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will have access to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently", she said, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in severe pain, without any help.
I'm afraid patients are asking to die because they're not getting the proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are working their patients to the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard's chances of survival were already slim when she abandoned the grueling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she said she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
She said I was finished!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank the caregivers for not granting their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Society of Greater Montreal, 8 percent of patients are resistant to pain medication.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is the practice of putting a patient to sleep until death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't hear that part of the pain anymore.
More and more, the unrelieved patient is going to have the option of having this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not cured always say the same phrase: "I want to die".
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable "system" involving the building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
This "industry" has been very costly for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system is falling apart since we took the big steps", quips Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into embezzlements related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to reculons.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult funding of parties and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", he points out, with some holding back their instincts to grab a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he added, hoping that it would be able to "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also working on this with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the cops from the "Hammer Squad" who, since 2009, have allegedly led the Montreal "sewage cartel" to put the pedal soft on contract swells...
In recent weeks, it has conducted a series of searches and brought fraud and corruption charges against elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, a suburban mayor.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of taking bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
The other defendants were engineers from the Montreal road works and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito was a big-time donor in the 2000s, donating more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about $68,000) to provincial parties, mostly to the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts he inflated the cost of
In Montreal, the corruption "system" was working perfectly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained to the committee: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000 from construction companies in exchange for contracts for sewers, the cost of which he inflated.
Other road officials have admitted that they have been greased by adding 30% to 40% to the bills, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget that fed his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has been protesting since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resold ... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be set up, she says that it "shoots at a thread of understanding the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-based investigative unit and a watch to prevent any further suspicious practices.
How we clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme", when they were not stepping into the trap!
He estimates that 70% of the money used in Quebec's election campaign is dirty money. He quipped: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to $100 but this will not change the situation, he says: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral expenditure, there will be dirty money in politics".
He advocates a complete overhaul of the public procurement and party funding system: "We cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression ?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
I'm making progress with them every day.
The technical staff has also been very helpful.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my game.
And in a game, it's easier.
Things move fast in football.
But I'm not getting excited.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine Pre-Training Centre to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by steps.
So you're taking advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's rookies are used to playing high-level games.
They also know that every practice is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and deliver the maximum.
And Carlo Ancelotti is a great help to me in my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man for the job?
Of course you are.
Ancelotti commands the respect of all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience and won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He's been around some great players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heart-warming conversation with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
How do you feel about the first game of the season for PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the lead from us.
But we're still in the lurch.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the last eight with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We're gonna try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we'll have a say against some very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, so we can receive the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He's already got the budget for it.
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and to be in the running.
Today, that is not the case.
The project is financed by the PSG.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we're really focused on getting that championship.
Last season, we didn't get very far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualifications to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, you're supposed to be the champion...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expects too much from the PSG?
It's only natural that we're expected to do a lot given the investment and the players we have.
We accept it completely.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame us for, it's sure to be a little frustrating.
You wonder what people expect more of.
We're never gonna win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put together a game plan.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer with a present.
Look at Manchester City, who haven't been able to make it to the last eight in two seasons, they've also spent a lot of money!
With the money you've invested, we thought you'd be 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
It shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say there is a "Zlatan addiction".
It means Ibrahimovic is very good and he scores a lot of goals.
He came for that and he's proving he's the star of Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He respects the men around him, too.
What he did is truly exceptional.
It's what drives the others to raise their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
What a disappointment.
I was so looking forward to this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from grabbing any playing time.
I saw things out there and I came out stronger.
Now I can make good plays in the national team.
It's what I've been looking forward to since I got baptized in the Blue.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now show good behaviour.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps' first months as head of the Blues?
He's got the results for himself.
We're well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires winning.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the draw in Spain on 16 October (1-1) a decisive match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before the crash in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
This is the exact opposite of today's monetary exchanges, which are based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded by 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Not much to be impressed by, compared to the world's trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has taken an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is distinct from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", which are used to advance in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
Facebook has also developed such a system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are at once bookkeepers, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses in the same way as an email.
Except a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can then verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins actually exist in the public ledger, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the imprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other being orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, which leaves a margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power.
Life on the network has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
"The flaw is not in the protocol itself", says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company that uses the Bitcoin network to make payments in real currency.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Big players like Wikipedia are refusing donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80 percent of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, "giant sales" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who has also written a textbook on the currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement away from hierarchical systems towards more horizontal ones.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to gain traction, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of a success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, not to expect everything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants whom we have punished as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 soldiers dead, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former chiefs who have fled to Pakistan, but often peasants who reject the foreign military presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base at Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, flying over by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban march on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country was in flames and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are joined in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They've become businessmen, seizing government land to sell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They have disrespected themselves; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, long for a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from the generosity of the United States: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have been exposed to the modern world in their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they have enjoyed the benefits of it.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of both girls and boys.
We must provide work for these young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opponents, is fond of mobile phones; television, with its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is watched everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already busy rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralisation, like the Western nations, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralised state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industries have been restored, no dams are in working order, no major irrigation systems are being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
It only added to the feeling that the Westerners were there to take it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or transportation to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employer.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of their imports and exports depend, to reestablish normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: girls' and boys' high school, university French department, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a department of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has led, and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which were carried out with the help of local labour, helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in arable land.
What will we leave as a memory after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would help to improve the local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, often situated at altitudes of over 2,000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small farm developments from local communities in Kapisa Province.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's agricultural policy is not affected by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.
A Constitution at the Grip in Egypt
This is another poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
With Egypt more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he decided to play it cool.
He took everyone by surprise when he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
The President of the Republic has given this Assembly two more months to complete its work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal tricks.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
Opponents say the president is still "a self-appointed madman", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample on the law".
The supporters of the new government claim that it is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within two weeks.
A very short period of time that forced the Brothers to abandon their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the contestation rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems confident that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
This is especially so as the rushed vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I keep my full powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling that they could not assert their views.
The same was true of representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 members, substitutes, were added hastily yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, most articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators have also mocked the fact that one of the only differences of opinion of the day was expressed around the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the clock of the constituent was badly adjusted.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Despite all the attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of the sharia are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", say the Liberals, who see it as a simple communication ploy.
Because they think the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They are particularly concerned about Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying the conformity of laws with the Sharia.
Egyptologist Sophie Pommier says this is worrying because "people who are called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It is the beginning of a theocracy".
The Liberals' fears are further fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
"At this time, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some of them trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity about Article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
References to "fiqh" are included.
And the question may be raised in the future as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on them".
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is heavily criticised because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are markedly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention was the powers granted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will civilians be barred from military trials, as human rights groups have demanded.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including freedom of the press.
Moreover, no article is more in line with the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern conveniences, and wildlife.
Argoumenty i Fakty has picked five big reasons to go to Israel.
Go worship at the holy places
A must-see: the banks of the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these "baptism pools" will be touched by divine grace.
Galilee is the land of Jesus' miracles - where he turned water into wine, where he walked on water, where he calmed the wind, and where he miraculously caught fish.
It was in this very place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk along the Street of Suffering, or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path starts near the Antonia Fortress (the Praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the Old City to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the place of the Anointing Stone and the burial.
This is the Christian world center, the symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is built on the site where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
It also houses the holiest place of the Jews, the Wailing Wall, which is the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
Tradition has it that people of different faiths leave small notes with prayers that are then answered.
Traveling high
Visit the ruins of the fortress of Massada, a former refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C. for his family.
These ruins are on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only those who love mountaineering can reach it on their own.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit of history.
In the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which is visited by many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs say that pagan gods once dwelt on the top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
It's impossible to visit all of them in one trip.
Here are five of the most interesting ones that are definitely worth checking out.
First, the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly half a million archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art
The main exhibited works are those by the Impressionists and the Expressionists - Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths made up of casts of visitors and guards of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guidebooks or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which revisits the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were exterminated in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in and you go into total darkness.
The stars are twinkling.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea.
Each of these islands has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not drop below 21°C, while the air temperature can reach 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and you can swim in it all year long.
By the way, this is the world's most unique sea, occupying the lowest point on Earth, 417 meters below sea level.
The blue water contains brine and easily holds swimmers, even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes around it are surreal in beauty.
People come to the temple for treatment with salt water, lime, and curative mud, and for various ailments such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, and diabetes, as well as for relaxation.
Unlock the Secrets of the Ancient World
They are guarded by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially enjoy walking along the narrow alleys named after the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls of the street that correspond to your sign, fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to take photos from all over Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquering" the Crusader fortress.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your travel, it is better to prefer dollars to euros, since they are easily exchanged for shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
In terms of urban transport, the main means of transport are buses, but Jerusalem has a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost like an underground cable car.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1 hour 30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition requires the Sabbath to be kept on Saturday.
From Friday night until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops and public transportation are closed.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, shellfish, and dishes that include both milk and meat.
It offers a wide range of dishes made from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, as well as hummus, traditional Jewish dough, various sauces, ground chick pea balls, falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, many well-fed cats walk around with a haughty air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats like to be in the open and they don't mind being tamed.
The price of a car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
The average price of admission to the museum is 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists debate what the law on the compulsory language test will bring, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families back home.
Since December 1, a law came into force that states that every migrant worker will have to pass an examination in Russian.
At present, this rule applies only to those intending to work in the service, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, in time, promises the Federal Migration Service, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also the knowledge of Russian history and the foundations of law.
You will need to validate your knowledge of Russian in order to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian is an official language are exempted.
The law also does not apply to persons who obtained teaching certificates or diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all cities in the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question many times in the press: what will happen?
What will the requirement to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
Firstly, say the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many speak about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service's office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the would-be migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the guise of helping, will provide him with a "trip" to a crowded house where he and dozens of his fellow migrants will suffer for months without food and paper and have to toil 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken, and they do not get the salary", confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for Work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many nationals from the Central Asian republics who wish to come to Russia to earn money say that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to visit, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune that few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford to have even a decent primary education.
Their families do not even have enough to feed their children, let alone to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these youngsters go to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished".
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no exam or formal work afterwards.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or not welcome"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always those language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
Besides, you can get a fake recording fast for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian cops know we have fake documents, we don't have a record, hence the extortion cases.
"They ask us for 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea", said Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, to the reporters.
"Hurry, don't skimp and buy yourself a fine work of art"
On the first day of the language law's entry into force, it was discovered that the immigrant registration papers were not the only ones that were fake.
Several forged language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The forged papers come out of a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not get them for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the examination had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Government officials and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper clippings".
The authorities may give migrant workers who were unable to pass the examination in the first place time to take language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered jobs in fields that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior is not in charge of the arms market.
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Interior is proposing to tighten the law against civilian gun owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents, from shootings at weddings to the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead.
Police want to ban the carrying of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the Arms Law will be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "screwing the screws".
An open letter has appeared on the Net in which the authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanded to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, in a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a registered firearm in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of the laws on civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot from a website taking orders for weapons
The first is "the military trace", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians", Baranets explains.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from the police stock and those stolen directly from law enforcement representatives.
Illegal guns are coming out of military warehouses.
Many of these have been the victims of explosions.
"According to the accounts, some fires were set deliberately to cover up the deficit", the former military official said.
Baranets thinks the gun manufacturers are behind it.
"Private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market are selling arms on the black market, especially in Moscow", says one expert.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
A large share of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes handmade, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply", adds the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
The experts have estimated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was produced in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from gun websites.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the guns on the black market ended up there "because of employees whose work is related to guns", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% come from "clandestine searches".
A salesman and consultant for a weapons factory who asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these specialists in the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most of the time, he says, the salesmen go to the military warehouses to get the new merchandise.
The person purchases a unit, for example a TT pistol, through a trade mark.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a grate.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers", he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from the illegal arms dealers", the salesman adds.
" Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone was going to take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, I was given it on the spot
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I have to know someone who has a contact, the salesman explains.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you also have to come and say for example "From such and such person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
The new kids look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried his hand as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish a paper on the subject.
The patterns, he said, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album that had "everything we wanted" in it.
"I thought I was in a luxury boutique", the soldier recalls.
There are no secrets for the buyer, Baranets explains, everything can be tried.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller in the woods and set up a target.
"They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating", the expert explains.
A shop from her couch
Search engines show the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
You don't need any documents or anyone to meet.
"All you need is a certain amount of money", says an advertisement on the "Buy a Fighting Pistol or Machine Gun" website.
Users leave their requests and ask their questions.
And sell to the miners?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a vast network of fake websites and is scooping up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush for food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia.
Victor Baranets, observer and former military
I've heard of these types of schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People are taking over.
The buyer makes the payment at the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions on where the gun is hidden", explains Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to a Gun Association.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying on the site, you can end up unarmed and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has created a vast network of fake websites and is rounding up people who want to buy guns.
"People are running for food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia", he says.
A Makarov for a hundred bucks .
Experts estimate that the cost of an illegal firearm can range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to a Gun Association, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100 to $300.
It'll take about a month and a half.
He got out of the long-term warehouses by running these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Ministry's official data, compared to the period from January to October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% and stood at 22.9 thousand, while the number of confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: fast food and supermarket workers strike
Almost a quarter of American teenagers go through a job as a cashier at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has been mounting against the low wages being paid by Walmart supermarkets and popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow in size or fade out quickly.
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the modest wage increases for the low-wage workers at Walmart and fast food chains, the protest organizers are pushing for the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, "Black Friday", when a torrential downpour of sales by millions of people swept across America, sometimes triggering scandals.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize picket lines with unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores, whose products are intended for consumers of the low and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs to milk.
The average price of groceries in these stores is 8% to 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of Walmart's low-paid employees shop only at their workplace.
Price and product choice made Walmart one of the most powerful corporations in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a pay rise, complaining that the price of health insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For the average Walmart employee who makes $9.50 an hour, that's a lot of money to pay.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkley, show that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That's 1.1% more than he's spending right now.
If Walmart were to shift all of the increase in wages onto the shoulders of the consumers, each purchase in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the group.
Black Friday continued in stores from 8pm to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second during that time.
His banks made a total of 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman assured the left-wing Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just a "com among many" by the organizing union.
"Next one in the line!"
The protests continued this week in New York and involved not only Walmart stores (which are not very popular in this progressive city, which is why they are not yet there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's advertises selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the federal minimum wage and New York state minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food companies are increasing them over time, but slowly, the average New York City employee is getting $8.90 an hour.
Nobody in this town gets paid less than they do.
I can't imagine living in New York with that kind of money.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living at their parents' home.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Now I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, there are comments that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protesters who started the movement at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday near McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law forbids the administration to interfere with this and punish union protesters by bullying or firing them.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over the fast food industry is still a difficult task, and for good reason.
One of the main reasons is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
They disagree.
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you have done honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said "we must all support fast food workers to get the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times described it as the largest fast-food industry event in history.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is difficult to say at this time whether this spark of mass movement will produce children.
"We're only getting average brain-tricks at the moment"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the head of the 3D Interactive Technologies Group at the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists at this company, glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by the creation of virtual open spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying at the same time to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has been left with pixels on the flat screen and sometimes touch screen for the time being.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and predict the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors were a step up, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the gesture control.
- What else is in the future?
- Although the Kinect has rendered the interaction physical, a lot of it takes place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has been improved (the system receives more data), but the yield, for the moment, not so much.
We're trying to change that, and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work with different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to bring the computer world into our own, into the physical world, make it more tangible.
However, this requires not only identifying the user but also the space surrounding him.
So we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command ?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
This is not the panacea. The problem of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of our actions or intentions.
In fact, every kind of computer interaction is good, but each in its own niche.
For example, in order to control the devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, not about broad gestures, but rather about discrete, narrow gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera in the device, but by a wristband worn on the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's currently large, but it's theoretically possible to shrink it down to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by mixed control, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this can?
You would do it with words and with gestures.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, this is gonna be hard to tell.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and that's very important.
- If we're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what is it that you don't like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
Obviously, it would be nice to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 cps.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all the current technologies are pretty good, which adds work to the algorithm designers.
The resolution should be kept in mind for the X and Y axis, but also for the Z axis.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is pretty dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond lab gave the sensor touch a regular processing delay between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
I'd need a device like this in my work, but it doesn't require touch, so I get more frames per second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second one is a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a common field-of-view sensor.
It's not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has never introduced its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with a smartphone in your hand all the time is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" augmented reality that would allow you to switch from glasses to smartphone from a cloud platform.
Glasses are a very personal device, and that's what makes them both strong (the personal elements are the ones you're the only one who can see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
It's perfectly recording the pressures!
But there are also technologies which are really intended to give palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the fingertips.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, and they are also a workplace that presents perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he normally should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task below which will take a long time to work on: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (not like those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we're only able to fool the brain to a medium level, and there are still many years of work to go.
That's what makes virtual reality work so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the project "The Petersburg Avant-garde" dedicated to the city dwellers who are in the vanguard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city's borders and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and vernissages trendy.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring crowds together, no matter where they're exhibited.
He is one of the St. Petersburg storytellers who are mainly social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller was a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took up a Barbary organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his bohemian image.
- Kirill, why are you walking around town in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as my couturier's specialty in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image maker and society.
But in society, anything that isn't grey is a source of aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to talk.
- And when did you know you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture where my work was.
I knew this was my path.
So, the old wave of unofficial painters was over and the new, free, my kind were misunderstood.
I started to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, everything but words.
And all of that ended up in your art clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I took a place at Pushkinskaya-10 which before the works housed a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Petersburg.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I can still see Chnour arriving with the project "L'oreille de Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in playback in tight t-shirts, including Igor Vdovin, a now fashionable composer.
When the band started to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of shows before Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his basic training and education was received at home.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboedov": these are reflections of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I'm a hero from the last century, from a time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: it was the award "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new age with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Nowadays, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work has a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they possess a very strong actuality and acuity.
I'm having an exhibition scheduled, "Russian Museum Through the Clowns".
Clowns belong to a category that is timeless.
I used to be a social person, but now it hurts and it's scary to be that way.
But with clowns, all that fades, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it's the dress that matters, we're interested in the outer mechanism, but not in the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we should spit in his face instead.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else can play it but me.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today's commercial art must be neat, delicate, and liquorious.
A disintegration of the culture is taking place.
In the old days, people were divided into herds, the bohemians liked one thing, the nerds another.
Everything is divided into micro-communities these days, so it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everybody.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to please.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people who've been dumped who come to see it, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and in the end it's less management, money, everything is wasted.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was younger, I used to paint paintings that a collector would hang next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones that people paint at the end of their lives.
Today, people often confuse ideas.
They say there's the spiritual culture, the consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I'm for that culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- They're good cultural experts.
There's this concept of the cultural official.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the good tsars, it wasn't like this, the tsars didn't understand culture well, but they understood that good experts must be kept.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're sidelined, because we need higher experts who will properly assess these experts and pave the way for them.
At present, it is the "reign of taste" that is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they don't take all contemporary art, that there are painters that should be found in other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who go to see exhibitions, concerts.
In our house, this layer is very thin.
We must make art as fashionable as it was in the early part of the last century.

Giving Birth in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle convoys with Earthlings on board are off in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, the big question is how do we continue to keep our species alive in zero gravity or on a backup planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
There are actually two real planets that we can conquer, if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Institute for Astronomy (GAICh).
If on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature on Venus is 500 degrees.
It's only habitable at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to look at issues of space reproduction by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, people were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of pea grown on orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put insects in orbit, small, breeding drosophiles.
In 1979, a team sent quail eggs into space to observe how a weightless embryo developed.
You get a normal chick when you go out.
That's when the trouble starts.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving", explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
With no support, the chicks moved in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks were not responding to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We opened their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there", explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, we have found nothing supernatural.
"It was still about biosatellites and it's the only experiment. You have to do this kind of research", says Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to reproduce directly in space.
It's not a small matter.
When animals are removed from their natural habitat, they are no longer able to exercise their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable of it, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thought, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not done for ethical reasons.
But women have been going to space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is the most precious thing in the world.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one had an answer to that question", says retired rocket and space industry expert Vakhtang Vatchnadzé.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Terechkova, gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, after two orbits and even working in extra-vehicular environments, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have very, very few cosmonauts who have nothing and give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it is dangerous even during orbital flights", concludes pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Centre: compulsory stage of flight preparation
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts are training for extravehicular exits.
Water is imitating weightlessness.
If for adults, water is a comfortable but alien environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on Earth came from the ocean.
Since the baby develops in the mother's lymphatic fluid for about nine months, it is easier for him to get used to water later.
It makes sense, because from birth to her first bath, it's only two weeks.
"It's very easy to forget", explains Marina Aksenova, a swimming instructor for infants.
In short, if for the newborn child weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of gravity.
In apesighture, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis atrophies very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that and rely on the birthing simulators.
Of course, we can arrange for a delivery in a special room, the woman will be able to get him out.
"And then?" asks Valery Poliakov, inviting us to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the body doesn't feel the pull of the earth, it doesn't form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experiment that we would envisage in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely unadapted", predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the home of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Supreme Institution for Public Financial Control) said: "The control of the so-called independent work (in Czech "Švarc system") has failed because of the politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and good quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution for Public Financial Control in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in our country", said Kala in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "Švarc system" by Petr Nečas.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the contractors with controls; is that allowed or forbidden?
"The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting and enforcing the law", Kala says.
At the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control in the Chamber of Deputies you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of the two countries were compared.
What was the specific issue?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for the way in which public contracts are managed and specific national legislation and practice follow.
We have gathered all this together and although this control procedure is not yet complete, some very interesting differences have emerged: in general terms our legislation may be 'more stringent and of better quality', but in some parameters the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to constantly develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the actual application of the law.
How can this project help you in practical terms and what does it mean for you?
A common control of this kind should help us to stop trying to specify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest price), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the thresholds of the markets will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who seek to find fault with it will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different way of organising it?
As regards the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof is similarly organised to the ISC, and also has a board with a somewhat different composition, but these two institutions operate in a fundamentally similar way.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country is the state's resources.
The public funds administered by the regions and municipalities in Germany are controlled at the level of the course of the Länder accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in certain areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, I'm sure it's not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country which we regard as a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment to the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution? Are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has only recently come into force, it has not yet had any impact on our control operations.
As we do post-audit checks, we have to expect a certain delay.
Our remarks are for the moment only about the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument for 'detecting the risk of mismanagement' with which we have screened almost 14 000 public contracts - but these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore regard the adoption of this law as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to comply with them.
Under the previous system, the provider (e.g. the regional council in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the law on markets constituted a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put additional pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to this?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going and inspecting and enforcing the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it", but he can't say we're going to act like it's nothing.
The law on contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a tenderer is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what we lack.
The roads are frozen in places, but most of them are still passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely operable, with some areas under increased surveillance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable this morning, but in some places frozen and also snowed.
Temperatures have dropped and are now hovering between -5° and -10°C but they should rise slightly in the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains on the plains.
The peaks of the Krusné hory are, however, covered with about a foot of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service shows that due to the fog, visibility was reduced in some places.
The R6 motorway and the national roads in the region are now easily passable.
However, caution is still needed, for example on some bridges where the coating can be frozen and slippery.
All county roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
Some of the tracks still have some frosted snow and in some places traffic jams.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers must be extra vigilant.
The regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Road and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and that snow layers, which are dampened by traffic, can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of frost formation in the areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be glazing in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the provincial and third-class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow, which is compacted by traffic, is present on the roads in the areas at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, mostly clear, with possible cloudy passages.
There will be a slight wind and temperatures will generally range from -3 to + 1 degrees Celsius.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen area are now passable, although in some places it is necessary to be more careful and adapt the driving to the weather conditions.
It's freezing this morning, with temperatures ranging from -3 to -9 degrees Celsius.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost easily passable, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The pavement of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be vigilant, especially on the less-traveled roads in the Šumava region.
The following areas are listed in the table below:
Drivers travelling to the higher areas of Olomouc region today have to count on a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field last night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are easily passable.
"On the heights of the Šumperk district there are remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník should expect to encounter a thick, soft layer of snow at the "Červenohorské sedlo" pass", the head of road maintenance services in the Šumperk district told ČTK today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also went there during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are easily passable, in the Šternberk district however drivers should be careful in the forested sections of the road to the wet roads.
The regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, the maintenance services of the North Bohemian highways have reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below freezing at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads.In the plains, especially in the south-east of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there is no problem and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic problems have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melting during the day, clear skies and freezing overnight.
The main traffic axes also report difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches that have bent under the weight of the snow to reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "Together we want to collect positive energy".
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month, the world should be ending?
It's just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group, The Tap Tap, we kind of laugh about it and think that we're the only group that can gather some positive energy left to postpone or prevent the end of the world.
And in December, you're putting together a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this project to our readers in more detail ?
It's a charity event we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically at the end of the Mayan calendar on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of the present time zone.
Whose idea was that ?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed it with our designer, Honza Augusta.
Aside from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world we are leaving for our children.
To celebrate the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap band along with other artists also recorded an anthem against the end of the world called "End of the world canceled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It's already very popular on YouTube, will it be heard at these charity concerts?
Of course, all in the end, well, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't occur...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also be played together at some point in a live broadcast, which is unique in the Czech Republic.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech showbiz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We are trying to get them to participate in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and enjoy it.
What good will the profits from these concerts against the end of the world do ?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the Jedlička institute, with the Tap association, for the last six years.
Teachers regularly visit the Jedličkův institute and offer students activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves cannot afford to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will move this project to a new independent building.
Do you have multiple bands and performers on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria did you use to select them?
We have tried to develop a programme that is suitable for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will take the stage.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" like this in the future?
In May we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring, and there we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We'd also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once in the States, I'd like to combine gigs in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap is still a group of disabled people.
How do you manage the organisation and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members in electric chairs whose machines must travel in a hold, and of course we also carry a lot of luggage and toolboxes....
So far everything has gone more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Your travels abroad will enable you to compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than here, we have just witnessed in Moscow that everything in the East is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to the disabled; there it is still not common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the city centre.
They do not yet consider it a matter of course to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, an association is also being set up there to try to draw attention to the problems of disabled people.
What do we have to do to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things that we're still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
It is not very common there, however, for a large number of disabled people to actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather the opposite, at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have among us famous sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are just isolated cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is very popular right now, so let's go back a few years, what was it that made you in 1998 start this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people who were ready to invest in something.
And since I'm a musician myself (I play saxophone, among other things), a colleague and I have started a music business.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we lost a little bit of control of the situation. (Laughter)
Success has only come in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
Yes, connecting with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We realized that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the subsidies of the European Union, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you ever set out to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
Show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned beings that we should pity.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the means to do so.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it's not just a breakthrough for them but for the whole of society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you're a demanding leader, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand a certain amount of discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and a head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already here in 1998 ?
There is only one, Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and go out, you can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to anyone who wants to join us.
That will be the day before the end of the world, starting at 9 p.m. on Thursday, December 20, 2012.
This action will take place in Prague in the arena Incheba, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song "The End of the World Cancelled" by The Tap Tap band will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre in Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The ticket price for this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the agency, the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the years since has participated in a number of ESA projects.
Poland's road to space, however, began much earlier.
Even before World War II, passionate Poles were working on spaceflight; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
The late Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great proponent of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned proponent of astronautics, and his contribution was rewarded by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925 a draisin was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, we do not know the author or the details of this project.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was intended to propel or slow down the drainage.
The only information known about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to focus on rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the archives that this research has reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937 plans of a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of operation, the outbreak of the war brought its activities to an end.
After the war, other works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problème, which contained four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to the study of space.
By this time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched, and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and as of autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held the post until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
An improved version, RM-1A, was subsequently built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was about four and a half feet long and weighed about 30 pounds.
The next prototype should have been capable of performing concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963 all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This two-stage rocket had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 23 miles.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland joined the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and a national committee was set up two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second non-Soviet cosmonaut in the program after Vladimír Dans Remek.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has caused a lively debate in the public opinion.
It is certainly worthwhile to look at this problem from a broader perspective.
The economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and the free (unlimited) movement of private capital in conjunction with unrestrained financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a tension on prices.
The term 'price-fixing' is used to mean that a producer, by importing goods sold at low prices, is trying to resist economic competition by 'making the competitor's price more expensive' in order to take over a larger share of the market and thereby increase his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to move production abroad, buy cheaply or disappear, resulting in high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and hence no responsibility for the unemployment it creates, the social burdens of the State are bound to increase.
All this is intensifying the perfectly unwillingness of the businessmen to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in different economies where governments of different countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard for social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to force the economic acceptance of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages, on the population.
This is achieved on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of longterm unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, public food distribution points have been in place for years for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own labour.
The number of such persons is already in the millions.
As the German economy becomes more competitive, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such salaries that the State is forced to pay extra to ensure that they reach the minimum living standard.
The scandal was revealed in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live on low wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that private capital will one day invest in their country.
The question to be asked is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of saying that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the command economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital is strongly defending the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question then arises whether private capital is not influencing and even directing politics today, and thus the whole state, in its own selfish interests.
The answer to that question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a practically all-powerful lobby present in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the drafting of draft laws to law firms with close links to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The whole of power does not come from the people, as the constitutions of the Western model declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracies are now rapidly confronting the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long in full decay and the functions were assigned by violence.
Bribery, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-performers and the corruption proliferated without limit and the people went to the elections with already sold votes"... ... "The honest people did not seek any office, the result was that the state remained 8 months without consuls".... 'It really began to be said that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man of energy"... It is true that Appianos had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, today's society is based on the preference for personal profit, with no regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and promote the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, today as in the past, an unprecedented decline of the elites, with no effort to carry out any deep reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely ignorant of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human losses, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abolition of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways of lowering the social level of the population.
This is a systemic trend.
The solution is sociopolitical reforms, which will increase the investment of state capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel is a laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will", Sting says in the song Fragile, whose main chorus line is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none", said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some are on Israel's side, arguing for its right to self-defence and casting the Palestinians as terrorists, others are on the side of the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is guilty and who is the victim in its waves of recurrent killings; after all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not live to see the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a "behind the scenes" view of who is the main beneficiary of the tensions that have been going on for over 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others arise from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
In any age, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individuals were acting independently or whether they owed their actions to someone on the throne who directed their actions according to pre-defined goals.
We must recognize that we are living in an age of global wealth concentration in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that creates certain powers could not have been achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth stands out the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
There is little written about them.
Of course I will.
In the early 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the link between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them an increase in their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 such countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschilds' Bank of America as a central bank and started issuing his own money during the Civil War and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK started issuing his own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while trying to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for power on a world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially British colonialism, and the third was to reduce the world population to between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and, finally, to acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - order following chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent a repetition of crises such as those which they caused in 1907).
After successfully starting World War I by assassinating Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the splitting of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany far-reaching war reparations, thus creating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it was enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing the finger at the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that was to play the role (which it actually tried) of a fifth column to set fire to the dust and start a war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to judge whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or whether everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany started the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel started the fire that could start a Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be as it was in the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just look at how sharply people divide between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong breeds another wrong in a never-ending cycle of violence and where the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world is at the root of everything?
We must distinguish between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like us, the international bankers only put their own candidates forward for elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand into a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all the world's oil passes (this sea corridor is only 2 miles wide) and generates a destruction of the world economy.
In what light does David Rockefeller's statement in 1994 now appear: "All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order?"
In their minds, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth with an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
"And he makes all men, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their hand or on their forehead, and that no one may buy or sell except the one who has the name of the wild beast or the number of its name.
Let him who has understanding count the number of this ferocious beast.
That number is man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: when things go wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, the revolution was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The hostages were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The movie Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, depicts an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After a complicated series of events, they met at the Canadian ambassador's residence.
Working with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran under a ruthless cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as part of a film crew scouting for a science fiction blockbuster.
Gender combined
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on the film project, press conferences were organized, and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, as the film was based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is part of a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiance is one after another: footage of Tehran in documentary style (in the subtitled footage are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events and the way, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with men in costumes discussing the situation around conference tables, in hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a derisive actor, he became a respected director, and his acting no longer provoked sarcastic remarks.
Argo is her third feature film after the dark police drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not to be set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above the Hollywood standards.
Affleck also shows this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive for its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does it very well, sometimes adding some elements to reality and here, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing strip is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipative nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it's true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a bigger role and they are by no means the only ones.
Affleck's film lacks a little dramatic tension, and is seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the direction and retro style of the 70s.
He's drawing the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story that is still, in some ways, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the portrayal of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the job.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually conducts a public survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition of the most absurd settlement or ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies was the origin of our decision", said the organizer of this survey, Patrik Nacher, to the newspaper Právo.
The absurdities mentioned already include, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have been better off in terms of life insurance rates because they are objectively less of a risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the requirement to add components to biofuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been voiced in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term 'tanning butter' or the withdrawal of conventional light bulbs.
The quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also behind, for example, the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm tall or have an 'abnormal curve'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogeneous national standards which complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some States, who claim that the existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize in this survey may be awarded to last year's EU regulation that inflatable balloons must have a warning on them that children under 8 years of age should not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American survey which showed that among toys, balloons are the leading cause of death in children from suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing into carnival trumpets.
We have some strange ideas in our house too.
The following rule regarding European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, anyone holding an official position within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" of liberal economists, Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum quantities for food stocks that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, subsequently exceeded the quantities fixed for canned mushrooms and was therefore liable to a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay sums of money to certain countries because they have no access to the sea and to grant a subsidy to apply for the granting of subsidies.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"Not having a sea is a handicap.
We are going to ask the European Union for reimbursement.' So said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that because of our wheat production and the so-called interventionist purchases, the State had been left with full stocks which it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
The European Commission finally responded positively to the Czech request and called for tender for the purchase of wheat from landlocked countries.
The grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), and were to be used to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "odd rules are rare".
While regulations often provoke criticism in the Member States, many experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the efficiency of the Union's functioning and its overall development are worthy of praise.
More serious, for example, according to the experts, is the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight in which it does not always win) is causing strong emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battling the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky', for the 'Tuzemský rum' appellation which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name 'Tuzemák'.
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, not beet sugar, may bear the name 'rum'.
The official list of registered products in the EU today includes world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck mashup or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň carps ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr") and Žatec hops ("Žatecký chmel").
The Pardubice spice bread ('Pardubický perník') and the cakes called 'Cornets de Hořice' ('hořické trubičky') can also be proud of their Community trade marks.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how does one get the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything was running smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can't stand to see how the country has been plundered for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and key and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to bring a solution to change it.
And since I am over forty years old and independent, I have no other choice to influence the situation than to run for the presidency or the senate.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set off for the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I always said I would enter the battle for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections
Later, I made it clear that if elected to the Senate, I would run for president.
My purpose is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That's why I need the most influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a nation are whining in the bar or in front of our television set, but that we are also trampling on those who are trying to bring about change.
Added to this is the press, which tarnishes the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been accused of bribing journalists or of being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Now, about your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the theme of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax returns over twenty million [CZK].
To do that, you have to change the law.
As president, you do not have that power and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, pushed for tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is the political system: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, non-party member, I have a much better chance of getting support from all the parties in Parliament.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and put it into practice.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing man or a left-wing man ?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn 't what you 've said prove it ?
When you're developing a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You try to get close to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without the support of Parliament, you're left with nothing but slogans.
You won't survive in politics for long with that.
Do you think that if you go and see people and talk to them, you will be able to, for example, to impose material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected President, it would be no problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
Then they may need to explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who identifies abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, which was achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without any hesitation, that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I'm a new political enthusiast trying to win the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to make things work on my own, and if it doesn't, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run for the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the oil fraud.
I came because people are really unhappy, but now I'm hesitant.
Sixty percent of the people didn't vote, and those who did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
I will nevertheless fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check every potential member's background to make sure it's spotless, and I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand in my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have a land in Prague worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, a collection of artworks worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth one million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a childhood dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove cars, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a $60 million estate, and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don 't want to invest your own money ?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not attracting much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my own pocket.
My campaign expenses are largely covered by the compensation I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, like paying for my son's English school which costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn't run for any elections.
So you 're going to continue your business activities so you can live ?
Didn't you say you were going to put your activities on hold?
But this is not linked to the amount of this remuneration.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan saving the Republic.
I must have something to live on.
What was your average monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was making, and I'm still making, between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd shut down my business operations.
You can read this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination.To be convinced, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it looks very futuristic, it's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer engineer at a large company nearby, tells us, "Yes, it's a really nice building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everybody has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
No one goes willingly into one of those lousy libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town that has nothing to attract Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 people has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give the brain a few extra neurons, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture by reproducing the seven fictional bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty little painted concrete miniatures.
The cultural offensive was not successful.
The city authorities realized that there was only one way to get control of the statistics: to build a library!
Winy Maas, of the Rotterdam architects firm MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the members of the jury still looked at each other, puzzled and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the shameless one, piled his choice of books in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech backed by activist arguments with a: "common thread!"
So here's my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the $30 million mountain came out of the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and some apartment buildings and community houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the book mountain received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus this dull little town, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of stunning ugliness, whose white facades invite the idea that they house a dairy, has been enriched with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under the cheese bell.
While an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, the real joys of reading and architecture are revealed to you when you step on the floor of the building and discover its topography.
The interior, made entirely of glass, is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant streetlights speak the language of the city's public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for public pews, dogs, and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Normally, the library racks are along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal", explains Willy Maas.
We completely upended the traditional spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain has been cleverly laid out: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and the technical centre of the building.
The library's black bookcases are particularly beautiful, sometimes as canvases, sometimes as balustrades, sometimes as stairwells.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and engineers don't want unfamiliar materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a reply to the Standard.
We found a waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membrane of one millimetre thickness has been used for many years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, and then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the Landbouwplastic (KPL) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and athletic shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
These create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the coastal mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology", says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun only shines for a short time inside, even on good days.
The thick wooden beams, set across from the glass façade, serve as a sunshade, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computer scientist mentioned earlier, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as the "soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This was done to fill the vacancies in the library, which was not yet fully filled (it now has 70,000 volumes).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are overflowing everywhere.
Architect Winy Maas said, "There is nothing worse than a half-empty library".
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration".
This is how MVRDV reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page in literary history.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
It is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why would you do that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany doesn't approve of what the Israelis did to Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has a special relationship with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have difficulty in taking a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to speak, defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union.
The Germans are therefore facing off on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still groping for that role, but they're on the road to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean to Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and the European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, i.e. its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other great powers: Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and its abstention from voting at the United Nations?
Firstly, Germany has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively one-sided relationship.
But this is a crucial element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany damage its relations with the United States by abstaining in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and the Americans understand perfectly well the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are mixed.
The United States, on the other hand, has announced its clear veto.
Do the views differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic American political scene.
I think that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overwhelmed with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policies.
Does Germany have difficulty reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand with the position of the major European partners on the other?
I don't think it makes things any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but that is not the case today.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider political line and must assert their singular position.
That is what they are doing now on the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will in future be a driving force and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It's not easy for Germany, especially because of the relations with Israel.
This question has always been a sensitive one.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which is more independent.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, or does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have trouble taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable with it and, for obvious reasons, it is still finding it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany decides to weigh more, there is a lot of anti-German sentiment.
It doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it's still the same problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with neighbors and a wide variety of opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European politics is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling that void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant and they're only less appreciated, that's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America collaborate on analysing the challenges facing the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a fellow at the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, U.S. foreign policy, and transatlantic relations.
"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trademark is thus protected in such a way that the company bearing the name cannot bring a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd win the case.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specialises in infringements of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my desk.
The copycatters only need a few more letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we're going to record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we're going to record Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as sports equipment manufacturer Puma, are also being copied legally.
Pattloch opens a file containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are many storey-high malls that sell almost nothing but counterfeit goods.
However, the Pattloch case is different: his clients instruct him to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
This is the term used for women who marry wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame themselves for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend", Pattloch demands.
"The brand is diluted, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially for the costly flagship products.
According to the market analysis company CLSA, China is the third largest luxury goods market in the world and the fastest growing, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros.
However, it is not easy to remove questionable registrations from the register of trade marks and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions cases where the court rejected the complaint because after a long period the name in question had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as it would damage his brand in China.
In this field, the law of the jungle sometimes prevails.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use a badge that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the buyer of Volvo, used to use a blue and white logo that reminded BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to the Hong Kong and Singaporean plagiarists who had turned the famous crocodile's gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office reportedly went from "an emergency in the course of work" to "a return to normalcy" last year.
Thus, the number of unaddressed opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases were reportedly closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
However, 81,500 cases remain pending in the Office.
The cost of action
As is often the case in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and it means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth consecutive time.
The same would apply to the total number of registered trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each recording earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or $1,200.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family-owned Freudenberg company illustrates.
For over seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans have certainly succeeded in getting the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to stop.
However, the copycat was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany", says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munich residents.
Freudenberg won the case in the next two cases, but the other side continues to fight to this day.
A Vigilance Needed
Today the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The process is long, demanding, and costs us a lot of time and money".
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs, and the archives department has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even offered the opposing party a "large six-figure sum in euros" to settle the dispute, but in vain.
"That's how you see what it means to you", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from that region were to exploit the unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register Freudenberg as a shoe and leather company in Germany.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the filing.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is the key".
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international trademark law, but foreigners should "register everything that is likely to be protected in China as well", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explained.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in that market segment.
World AIDS Day: stamp your feet, sing, help the people
The Imbongi Choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland are looking forward to their visit.
This is the story of a bond that goes far beyond the 8,733-mile distance.
First, we tap the floor with our feet: cowboy boots, sneakers, women's slippers, and men's loafers, all seek the rhythm by tapping the floor with their feet.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - as they go up, down, and down.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly supple gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers ranging in age from 23 to 69 came, from the human medicine geneticist to the house man.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each chorus member has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Getting Help for Helping Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations program for the fight against AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are infected with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found godparents in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of these are in secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a godfather.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
The Zulu word "imbongi" means "story-teller" or "praise-singer".
No one in the area can fluently speak Bantu, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany and now returns to its home region: South Africa.
For the village of Esitjeni, which is 8,733 kilometres by air from Heidelberg in the north-western Kingdom of Swaziland, is dependent on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest huts of straw or dirt and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as their parents have died of HIV.
In Esitjeni, one can see on a smaller scale the ills that afflict Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon for people to die in their mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had the opportunity to discover the village, and the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who not only lack parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who personally committed themselves to paying a few dollars a year so that they could send a child to school and provide a hot meal every day.
But just one year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since then been dealing almost professionally with the AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubis lice and scabies are parasitic STDs.
Which groups are mainly affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany are caused by male sexual contact.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhoea and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV transmission among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, but about 20% of new HIV infections are observed among this group.
The rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher among young people than among other population groups.
According to European statistics, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of infection?
It is not compulsory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases more than doubled in 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital abscesses, urinary pain, discharge, lower abdominal pain, and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they usually do not cause pain or other symptoms and so remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100% protection.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or close bodily contact.
So experts recommend that anyone who frequently changes sex partners undergo regular physical examinations.
Most STI diagnosed early can be cured and late-stage complications can be prevented.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds raised by the choristers thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the funds are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, handles the money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans have a good place to live, perhaps with one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, as the Zulu call old women, are the pillars of the village.
Some of these homes house up to 14 orphans, provide shelter for them, and make sure that they arrive at school on time in their uniforms every day.
The orphan, who has no one left, is taken to a safe place, to Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school and helped build two chicken houses, and with the help of the American health organization PSI, has organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not to be taken for granted, for although the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo", says Lennartz, "because it is a sexual subject".
That's curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These and other government-sanctioned practices are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
Yet, says Annette Lennartz, condoms are found on every street corner, "but hardly anyone uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh".
To promote cultural exchange, the chorus of the Imbongi choir goes on a trip to Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white people singing in African languages is such a sign of gratitude that it not only brings good cheer and joy but sometimes tears to some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godparents.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light", they say.
And after a flight of 8,733 kilometers, back to Heidelberg, in front of those choristers who are stamping their feet in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find light.
NASA has discovered the presence of ice on Mercury.
The MESSENGER probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The American space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the sun, it has frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the journal Science.
The MESSENGER probe has reported evidence of an ice sheet in the region of the planet that is permanently shadowed.
The blanket would be at least 12 inches [30 cm] thick and up to 20 feet [60 m] long.
The water is probably from comets or maybe asteroids that hit Mercury.
However, no one has linked the discovery of water with the hypothesis of life on the planet, says the lead scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help us understand how water and other elements essential to life arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes, and tiny robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send back images to Earth, like little gaps through which we observe infinity.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition of the term.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the more difficult-to-identify pink dots are the "newborns" in the birthing room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this star-forming region, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer telescope has photographed the blazing brilliance of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star throws out when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust are forming new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen by the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope is more colorful.
In this infrared image, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to an earthly continent earned it the title North America.
The combination of the normal and infrared images produces a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its glory.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest pictures ever taken by the Hubble telescope is of the Whirlpool galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can be works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (split, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic shambles in the constellation of Serpentarius: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are rushing towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname "southern fire wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a detail of the Iris Nebula, in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was created from optical and radiographic images taken by various telescopes.
Here you can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle is always giving birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are linked by the Rosetta Nebula, also continually form young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy, with its bright rays and a small black hole hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe - The Major Telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow, and with them it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows one to observe the universe through two mirrors each measuring 8.4 meters in diameter.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on La Palma, Canary Islands, is enormous, with the mirror alone reaching a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa was segmented to save money.
The diameter is still about 35 feet.
The disadvantage of the economical method of construction is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed to the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is its great light-collecting ability.
Despite the mirror's relatively small diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for signals from beyond Earth with the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 1,000 feet.
Anyone with a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) by contributing the computing power of his computer.
View from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a facility worthy of the name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach an impressive height of 42 meters, and it will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors, each 30 feet (10 m) in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and IRTF.
A new giant telescope is also planned to be built on Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of up to 100 feet [30 m].
This illustration is admirable.
However, the most important images of space are from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks will be to search for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Scientists think that the south pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's north pole.
Radar data had been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the MESSENGER spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now know for sure.
Drink butter every day, and live to be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach old age, worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
Many people in southern Azerbaijan reach an age that is comparable to that of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years old.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is a little bit of a romantic.
The small bus swerves along the many bends of the road, along wooded hills, over flowing rivers, and along modest farms.
It's green and fertile, and it's almost like the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group known as the Talysh, about whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azeri fluently and have a very long life span.
I'm going to finish it.
The small town is a shining example of the Soviet-era architecture that is not at all compatible with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, and the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is far too arduous.
It takes eight hours to cover the 200 miles [323 km] of one-lane road.
The province has yet to benefit from the country's legendary oil wealth in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision song contest, and next year the festival of the world's oldest people will be held here", explains Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
The life of about eight dozen Talyshs from the region who are over 100 years old can be seen there.
This is my grandfather, he lived to be 120 years old.
Having another child at 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who reportedly lived to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And when we consider that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973", Fatulayeva said.
The man was said to have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 years, he was said to have conceived another daughter.
Could Şirali Müslümov have been wrong about his age by a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck-Institute in Rostock, Germany, also heard of the old man of Central Asia.
"Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", explains Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old".
However, it is impossible to establish scientific proof due to the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
A glass of melted butter every day
Nevertheless, it is true that the people of Lerik often live to the age of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
But Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the area.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barrel, beating the contents of it tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little kids are also playing around in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests served in typical armored belly-shaped cups.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long dark blond braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost it and kept the color.
"I have never used shampoo", Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate what she grew on her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never bought a single food item from a supermarket in my life.
Then she tells us about her husband being in the military.
The worst times were after World War II.
But things got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is amazing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He remained in power until 2003, when he was succeeded by his son Ilham.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) monthly for her pension, a sum that guarantees a good standard of living in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-graying son is right: "older people are highly respected in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human Rights" Missed in the Constitution
The revolution is born again in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia is hotly debated.
The Egyptian president is not short of words full of emotion.
We must make the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the people as a whole, but also to Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For all the members of the opposition confused and desperately disunited are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world don't really know what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the University of Southern California in the US, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drawn up by the majority-Muslim constituent assembly of 100 people in a fifteen-hour night shift are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides for jurisprudence based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to enforce a stricter interpretation of sharia.
At any rate, this is what a newly introduced article suggests, stating that in all matters concerning the Sharia, the al-Azhar University should be consulted, the institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will control the legislative apparatus, which would in effect bring the judiciary under its wing.
Many points of the draft constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts were used to suppress dissent.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, the bill says, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State could even control the content of the art of cinema and literature.
In plain English, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his emissaries.
But the article does not define what a transgression is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording that implies that "offending persons" is forbidden.
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
There are many points to be interpreted in the bill that Morsi is putting to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians "very soon".
"The revolution is rising again"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concorde in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down Sharia law before it comes into force.
"The revolution is rising and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of fomenting a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls for a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated", said Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they will not monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile where a large prayer was being held in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the Salafist supporters, who participated in large numbers, shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
"Clean up our country!" they demanded of Morsi, claiming that "the Koran [was] their Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have created a situation akin to a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud.
They believe that now is the time to let the people decide by the ballot box the direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will surely win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned even once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their worldview, but because he considered human rights indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even mentioned once in the new Constitution", he said in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are a blatant violation of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto taking away all its powers", Saeda laments.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control".
Is Norway rakfisk the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be tied to the locals' appetite for a fish that smells extremely good?
Have some of those advanced cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of wet, dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the unpleasant smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It snows, the scenery is spectacular - and that pervasive smell permeates the air.
Rakfisk is made up of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can be up to a year.
When it gets dark and it gets cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw and then you swallow a glass of aquavit", explains full-time local firefighter Havard Halvarsen, also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival management.
All around us, people are swallowing little pieces of fish and stuffing themselves with a lot of booze.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk", says Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying out a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it's not bad - it reminds you of sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before refrigeration was invented, the fish was dipped in airtight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, after the fish had been well fermented, it was taken out and - no doubt with the senses dulled by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - over 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Sweden, their old rival, whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 euros each.
Norway is not often mentioned in the international news, which is not to its disadvantage.
Here people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they refer to this killing, they refer to the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could commit such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has been rich from its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success", explains our waiter Anna, with blond hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, holding a tray of rakfisk in her hand.
We are - how you say - a cautious people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be seen.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window, in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway kept its purse strings very tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm standing in line to buy food - I've had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made of eel, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or maybe the most smelly of them.
There's a TV show where the host wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"What did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Harvard".
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, possibly from over-watering.
Or maybe it's because of the fish fumes.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto has had a rough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges ahead and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
In a city where traffic jams are rampant, a security barrier has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to stop people from going to their work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarves to become the new president in charge of the nation.
He's got a complicated assignment.
Mexico's economy is doing well, thanks to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of some 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before working with the US president, Mr Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A vast, sprawling state surrounding the capital, and in his beloved homeland, opinions are divided about his new leader.
A man of directness
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is written in the memory of all.
The locals attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune to him.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement in these roads, once bumpy and full of cracks.
Plaques bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting changes", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and Mr Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
In terms of security and the economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so badly needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He's a man of integrity, a man of commitment, with a great vision for the country.
He's an excellent statesman and, above all, he's a good listener.
However, this is not always the way people think of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the highway bridges, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help fight drug gangs that are rampant in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly severe.
In one disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years were found along the edge of a landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's critics say that at best, he has failed to stem the problem of murders committed against women during his time in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version is that Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I got to her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed", relates Señora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the rigidity of the corpse had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana is hung on the wall, next to a cross with the word "Justice" written on it.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions", she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his wrap on Saturday, it will come with a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make it a priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as president as he was when he was governor", said Olvera, to Congressman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of mistreatment that Bradley Manning was subjected to during detention.
The trial is about Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is requesting that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's abduction was carried out under extremely difficult circumstances.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the U.S. military -- missed numerous opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he claims he suffered while in military custody.
In cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Major Ashden Fein claimed that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be dismissed on the grounds that the detention was made under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after their meeting with Manning, while he was held at the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to maximum custodial isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein discussed the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he received in the prison was overall "very professional".
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and that didn't mean I didn't raise problems", Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the special committee that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed to indicate a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his own protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from that status... to have a better quality of life from my perspective", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he contemplated suicide when he was in Kuwait and once fainted in the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also said that the only items he had were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to keep moving, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after he was forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no point was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During Friday's questions from the judge, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he had to drop his blanket that could have concealed his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he was trying to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used his underwear band or his thongs to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences in detention and significantly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty by a military court, a trial that is scheduled for early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the lesser charges and fight for the dismissal of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations that govern the conditions of detention of all inmates at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, colluding with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmitting information relating to national defense.
If all the charges are dropped, he faces life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of the hard times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I was lost in the lobby of the immigration and customs office.
Signs pointed to two routes, one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and one for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which way to turn.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It is an ethnic qualifier, as well as the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for special qualifications or links.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I grabbed my American passport and headed to the "foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite topics are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons that Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking their lives in the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada in creating a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto vows to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, though he didn't provide any further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory at gunpoint in writing.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
So, as soon as any U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one it has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and its losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country offers none.
The only reason there are so many Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, maybe a relative or a grandparent, didn't find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person matched a typical profile -- dark-skinned, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream right now, and we've been to good schools and we've got good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it's the American dream that we're living, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
And we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they treat us as if we were individuals of inferior race and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
To them, our existence is a failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they never would have left.
And we wouldn't be stuck on the good side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans are more assertive about their identity and Mexican-Americans are more upset about it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels that she belongs to two countries.
And many of the Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they belong to either country.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the music of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in neither.
In Mexico, they think we're Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as goodwill ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a great country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the inequality of pay, corruption and drug violence that are rampant, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to fend for yourselves, amigos.
It's only natural.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still hold grudges against them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I know.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old feuds, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started it, dozens of buildings have been razed to the ground; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring blew it all to pieces, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to believe that it could help them to break out of this deadlock.
A War That Has No Losers or Winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire agreed on November 21st is still in place, this week's fighting has strengthened the forces on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has been beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven Gaza's 1.7 million residents back to one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals in Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders may say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful.
Turkey, a rising regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken up the cause of Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members are cheering and saying that the Islamist crescent is bending around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah militias dominate, to Syria, where Islamist rebels can topple Bashar El Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more likely to rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a major player that cannot be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven effective and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their heels for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
But most of all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket attacks from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, thanks in part to the separation barrier that encircles the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more hawkish party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the upper hand.
Why coddle these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were heading for the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they pop their heads out.
Maybe the hardliners will win; but the Arab Spring may change the game.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is a good omen -- and could be the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, denying the Palestinians their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories - much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains that advocated by reasonable people on both sides, and by most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One small, short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity for outsiders to advocate for this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state according to the 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs in the outside world should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming pseudo-state proposal at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has a vested interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow view.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packets have come into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs cover the dark green packages which are all identical, regardless of brand
This legislation, which has been enacted in Australia, is a world first, with the logos and colors being replaced by dark olive green and horrible photos of diseased organs and images of children and babies whose diseases were caused by the smoking of their parents.
Apart from the different pictures and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small letters on all the packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by removing all glamorous depictions.
Studies have shown that if people don't start smoking before the age of 26, there's a 99 percent chance they'll never start.
"Even at a very young age, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image", said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have found, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess".
Even though Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering similar approaches.
The tobacco industry lobbied against the bill.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would revive the black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be harmful consequences from this legislation", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had given their activity a boost.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for replenishment.
We're doing well.
The only downside, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the targeted population.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local businesses and websites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you're in the tobacco business and you have a small display window to promote your products, the Internet is the place to go", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple Marlboro cigarette-loving citizen who has taken the trouble to make a video, or is this a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning pictures on packaging mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are being issued in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are currently being considered in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these pictures.
I don't mind the pictures, you know.
I don't know them.
"You take a cigarette and put the pack away", said Victor El Hage when he was buying a pack that had a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is because of my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to keep packages on the shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours", Yu said.
"The government should have banned them once and for all and we would have said OK, fine, we'll stop and lock the door", he added, raising his arms.
In a world that's constantly connected, it can be good to be bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during the Thanksgiving season because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
As a result, I have had ample time to reflect on the subject of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and child-development experts are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
It forces the brain to take interesting paths, even feeding creativity.
And because most of us are constantly in front of multiple screens, we no longer experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
I know.
And you didn't.
But I'll get back to you.
First, like many others, I thought that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes back a long way", he said.
Latin graffiti on the walls of Pompeii, dating back to the first century, evokes boredom.
Then there is our definition of boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing many publications and presenting the idea to a panel of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to do something but failing to engage in a satisfying activity".
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not actually undertaking a task even though they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
At the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, coupled with a sullen mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two may be linked, bored people tend to think the problem is the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem is them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's really a concentration problem.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard the sound of a TV show that had no connection at all coming from the next room, others heard the TV show only, and a third group heard no sound at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low volume said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or demanding task, a disruption in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you are doing a boring task, "like looking at objects on a production line, music can help you not get bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that when you squirm or scratch, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at one time or another - my flight delay, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Boring Predisposition Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Many of the tasks I perform are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all".
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and one of the things they need is a wide variety of stimulating activities.
But teenagers are usually quick to get carried away.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he reached out to nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of the teenagers reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the boredom rates of today, 21 years from now, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its peak", partly because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
Let me ask you again, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes it doesn't, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble, or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of letting you know you should be doing something else", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do is.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Dr. Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another", he says.
Your child is not just learning to have fun, he is gaining more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just like I don't think we should be criticizing him.
To feel comfortable outside the constant seething of activities and technology is the goal we should strive towards.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We need to be bored more often, but boredom awakens a keen and frenetic desire to be connected to something meaningful", he said.
He says what people are looking for is a way to unplug and enjoy the downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated", he added, "it is difficult to find ways of getting into something when the noise stops".
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old college student and football player Anthony Orozco in Colorado is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were riding in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and paraphernalia - minor offenses, each carrying a $100 fine - and a court date.
"We are treated like criminals", said Mr. Orozco.
But is he?
In the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low-level drug use was more about location than law.
Here and in Washington state, which has passed a similar measure, hundreds of marijuana-related crimes have been dismissed.
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 and older for minor marijuana possession, as the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have called for accelerating existing marijuana cases and continue to charge people with possession.
In parallel, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-licensed marijuana retail stores in their neighborhoods.
"Things are moving so fast that I don't know what the future holds", said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
The regulatory agencies in Washington state are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether you like it or not, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for therapeutic use and now for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and that's a good indicator", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves", he said.
Washington's law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of a year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state's mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis retail establishments within a 30-mile radius of a school, park, playground or daycare.
"There will be no place more difficult than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis business, especially in the Seattle metro area", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Cannabis Legalization, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 and older for possessing small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this type of offense "with immediate effect".
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck embodies a more rigid view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure users to get clean.
At present, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are facing other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was a recognised offence", said Mr Buck.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer serving adults for possession of narcotics.
County prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana possession cases without a trial.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a proper legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana use is not an easy task.
And the mixed reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"It's a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing people accused of marijuana use and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it is legal", he said.
As the first states to treat the moderate use of marijuana on the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are on their way to becoming a case law for drug legalization.
As advocates and state representatives anticipate a new frontier of legalized sales, they anxiously await guidance from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates hope the Justice Department will back down.
Despite some well-publicized arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed businesses selling medical marijuana to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While police are unlikely to break into homes to seize small bags of drugs, they are likely to oppose the licensed marijuana businesses that are allowed to sell marijuana for personal use under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities didn't wait for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana retail stores, even if it's only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and they're expected to impose that ban next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we have a federal problem", said city councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're interested in the community vote rather than the state vote.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory.
It's not just students today who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far back as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what I thought was a preeminent place of learning, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheater that encouraged the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late '80s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduates were having sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson famously said that I left after being forced to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was constantly bullied and intimidated.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why bring this up today, you ask?
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, along with those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Student Chamber (JCR) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their plight was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which focused on student politics and depicted the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Among them was student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, sported a silver suit and walked with a chrome-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for the implementation of the tuition increase".
Luke Black, 20, vice-chairman of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday Times that "there is a growing left-wing bias in the universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even having met us".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members", she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and a paralyzing shy girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to award Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I got a taste of what was to come.
I found that the professors not only shared in the sarcasm of the Tory students, but also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the politics of striking miners, privatization and government opposition to the apartheid sanctions in South Africa were etched in the classroom.
The first sarcasm I was subjected to was about an 18th century French text translation into English, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a puffy face, was prone to anger.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears were burning in my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time - well, if you're not too busy making friends", he said in a snarly tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I was sitting alone and then I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the case.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This ploy failed.
A first-year student in philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was a pervert, a dirty one.
"How do Tories make love?" one of them asked.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I was a homosexual before the liberal legislation of the '60s.
Could I have at least had a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become a Labour and renounced my views?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He was hardly ever there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he said.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
When he was at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the town with the dreaming bell towers.
Even my Communist friends had some very good manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional strength gradually declined.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
In a course of study the following week, when another history professor suggested, in the most serious manner in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
With a deep, red-faced shame, I admitted that my parents had been brainwashed and called them "crazy old men".
The respite was short-lived.
My father was the one who nailed the final nail in my Oxford coffin.
At the time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed hidden in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a wet, crying chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school setting.
The most tragic part is that it was Oxford, which has not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier acknowledged him at the unveiling of "Valentino: A Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-fashion models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and the nobility apart.
The first room of the exhibition, which will be open until March 3, will feature a striking number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest couturier of the northern Italian town of Voghera to the international jet-set idol.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't smash cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model of the car
Argentine model Valeria Mazza has not forgotten the charism of the couturier either.
Several years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the décor, the food, the music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go out of style, because its creations are works of art", she concludes.
The parade of the noble line
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He likes people with high status and the biggest titles, and they like him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous stage sixty meters wide that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk on the podium to admire a "public" of dream carrying the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and fur that had belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
Among the models in the audience are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like first love, "unforgettable".
I remember it well.
It consisted of a pair of trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection of 1971-72.
"It was a gift he gave me", said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muse's.
"I prefer him to all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they're bright and they brighten up the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg, a fashion designer, cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of being old enough to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a skirt with flip-flops, a draped bust and a neckline that fell off.
"It was a dream come true", said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless", says the Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg preserves the couturier's evening gowns with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the tailor calls his tailors) to make this dress of ivory silk with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of lace, and a four-and-a-half-meter sleeve.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority on the fashion industry, the dress represents a historical fact of late 20th-century high fashion, "the return of high-society clients".
Overshadowed for years by the "well-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now their best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of her clients' husbands.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, its calmness, its neatness and its perfection", says d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my dearest friends.
"He was impeccable, the years had no effect on him".
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen human mules
For four dollars, Indonesian volcano porters risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep stone paths.
There are people who work in hell and others who work in literal hell.
One such person is Antwo Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the Indonesian island of East Java.
He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfuric gas from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with air.
After collecting large rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of about 70 kilograms, he places them in two bamboo baskets and carries them on his shoulders across the steep paths.
It is only 250 meters to the summit of the 2,386-meter-high volcano, but the exhausted bearers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance at the pace of a tortoise, keeping their balance and measuring their steps so as not to trip and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell to her death from the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners at Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once on the top, they fight their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the three kilometers to the scales that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters.
The company that has been operating the volcano since 1960, PT Candi Ngrimbi, and its employees, are paid 662 Indonesian Rupees (US$1.45) per kilo of sulphur.
She then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to bleach sugar.
"Because we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees ($3.70) for each trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each one takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this earns him 138,000 rupees (US$80) at the end of the day.
Although it may seem a pittance for such superhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees ($1.50) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees ($1.70)", says the porter who once worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and eyes irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he's spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already started to take its toll on him despite covering his face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay for pursuing his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Abused by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he is doing the job of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden hut with other carriers, rising every day at two in the morning because sulfur keeps gushing out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters carry the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not pay the 30,000 rupees ($1.75) surcharge per camera, in addition to the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees ($1.85) that the park guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the animals, not for the humans", protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old, stout porter who has worked at Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he says he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious illnesses - to which are added, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only carry 50 kilos.
Each day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a goat trail covered with weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life", Unainik says, opening her mouth wide, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur porter.
Time passes, but misery is passed on from generation to generation. One of the most difficult jobs in the world is the work of the human mules of the volcano Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population must grow".
I'm a husband and a patriot, you're my wife and a patriot, let's do our civic duty and let's give our lives!
It may seem unlikely that these words came from a commercial for mint-flavored tablets, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics are from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychene in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way with this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty".
It's for the Internet only, so we've been able to make it fun and entertaining.
This is the main problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in terms of birth rates, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing pheromone perfumes or having speed-dating parties.
A lot of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we said, what's more creative than solving this problem by making a rap song?
1.2 Children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure to support marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 as the renewal rate was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Ming Wei, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and starting a family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in the number of single people and to the delay in marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that are rife with thinly disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of pulling down salaries and not fitting in.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year had its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by introducing quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the Singapore example also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to affect the real estate industry.
The urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and are very successful in sales.
However, authorities are concerned that they may promote a celibate lifestyle and discourage developers who wish to build large single-family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" are selling much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For that reason, it's much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in a bind if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new regulations may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district downtown, it does not seem to have much effect.
"People are under a lot of stress, houses are expensive, education is expensive, so people put it off", says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But I think it's important to have my money and my time", says another young man in his 20's.
Both men and women cite career stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for not having children.
So while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What 's private offline is private online .
Confidentiality
According to the Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of private property or "the private property that we can protect from intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under 16?
How can we apply this definition in our daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposing himself to by posting on the Internet events that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, who frequently use the Internet.
In four cases, they combined the term 'something very personal' on a personal level with 'password and username' when applying it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post", says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of the term "private" on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret things, my mother may know them but not everyone", he says.
I post funny pictures or games on my Facebook page.
I also talk to my friends.
"I won't share any of my pictures or anyone who would make a fool of himself", he said.
The boy recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene, naked pictures of people, crimes or humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on Facebook and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are family.
His mother's on the list, she knows the password to one of the accounts.
I've started a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they reply, I just post them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends, in a quick way", he says.
He says he would never accept a proposal from a stranger.
He will not trust anyone who recommends a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friends list.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, like music", he says.
According to the boy, no one made advances or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account", he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we now know as cyberbullying are not new to the young boy.
A friend of mine's family was being blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he says.
According to José, the victim didn't close his account.
"He just passed it in private profile".
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this youngster would post photos of people he knows in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or pissed off.
"Even though I know it's cyberstalking", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English professor and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was born as a way of finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in education from Yale University and is the author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are those children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves", she said.
He adds that the issue is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined standard on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
The expert says that the most effective way to teach children and teenagers confidentiality is to use thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do it is pointless", she says.
Next, Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like it if they posted a picture of you like a friend's picture you posted?
Do you know what other people are posting about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people's permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every second?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the internet, everyone should act with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be true on social networks", she says.
The monitoring
Eduardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary school teacher, and an educational consultant, says that it is vital that parents carefully read the terms and conditions of social networking sites.
Understanding each term will provide a solid foundation for discussing the implications of Internet accounts with your children.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish", he said.
Guardia says that it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was announced earlier and theoretically adopted by the 7 mandatees present.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit, and then stated that it would be published at any moment on the Peruvian government's website.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Access to information on the summit was constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information that was circulated among journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the governments of UNASUR who were present at the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the summit's "final declaration", but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of the South American Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, despite press pressures, it did not release the declaration also known as the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the access to information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru jointly agreeing to accept a Hague Court ruling that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they respected the ICJ's decision to hear the pleadings of both sides in the case that Lima filed against Santiago and which starts on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and implement the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing before this international court today", declared President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts", added President Piñera as he shook hands with President Humala, alongside flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was given the task of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Commissioner read out the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would make "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, access to low-cost Internet throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to envision a better future for our peoples", President Humala concluded.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connectivity of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Of these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the cross-sections of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a larger connection with Ecuador, although he did not give the most extensive details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of peace and prosperity, integrated and in good relations with its neighbours, was another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ ruling requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will ask for a discussion with that country", he stressed.
'I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,' added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship", says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example from Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "had killed each other in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make a thing of the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also advocated the reestablishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Human Rights Pact.
Those who tell us off never compromise, but we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington with US funding", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret his decision, as he did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
He also criticises the Swedish justice system for requiring him to be interrogated on Swedish territory for alleged sexual offences, while "Sweden's own legislation allows for this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa claimed that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health was deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious", the Ecuadorian president said.
It is possible that physical and mental health may be impaired by being confined to a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects everyone's health", he concludes.
Correa points out that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he points out that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We don't negotiate with human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings before different European bodies", he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain were to grant safe passage tomorrow, it would be over".
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has done in other cases, interviewed Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interviewed him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and made it clear that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists for the sake of greed, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this sense, he was pleased that this is not the kind of journalist "or the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than promoting his reelection, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We must tackle them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that it would be "beneficial for Latin America to go to the international courts if both countries agree to accept such a firm judgment".
Referring to the possibility of his running for a third consecutive term in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, he said he looked at the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the February 2013 primaries, he will retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility", he said.
If I win, it will be my last presidential term and I will then retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health", he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with an appeal for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths today are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he tested positive for HIV.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head", he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", to no avail.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take charge of his illness and began to inquire about it and his determination was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmas.
Even the director of a clinic at the IMSS refused to say good-bye to him "because he was speechless".
In those days, AIDS was a death sentence.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "worn out" their immune systems and fall victim to opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious disease specialist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system damage that patients present at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to 30 years for those with a CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those with a CD4 count of 500.
Simply put, this means that if someone is diagnosed as HIV positive at the age of 25, "as long as they remain under control, they can live without problems until they are 75", the scientist said.
To put this progress in context, it is important to note that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the emergence of AIDS, 60% of the patients registered in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
For the last 12 years at least, we've never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it in very advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact that "nine out of ten patients arrive with an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, to offer mass testing to all those who ask for it".
The experts and members of the Jalisco State Council for the Prevention of AIDS (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to take his test in a private laboratory simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he already had AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you find out you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better have sex three times a week", they say, which I don't.
The change has been beneficial, I'm eating right, I'm exercising, I'm taking my medication.
So far, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day against AIDS.
Let them get tested, if they've taken risks, the sooner they know if they're HIV positive the better, and if they've already been diagnosed, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, responsibly.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter.
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who has covered the HIV cause.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, that is very good, but the result is that even today, some people do not have access to condoms", he says.
Among those most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?" asked sarcastically and value-judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, the journalist assures.
He proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but be found in the dispensers of public toilets and in places frequented by young people.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González said when asked if there would be a condom distribution in his administration.
"That's not how sex works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active", he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases combined (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in the number of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are bloodborne and 2% are perinatal.
An estimated 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every one reported case, there are four or five people who don't know they have it.
A ruling upheld on appeal by a US court ignores the debt restructuring of the Vitro group that was agreed through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a damaging precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighboring country and solvency problems.
It seems that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star-studded flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling delivered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of embargoes on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court on three grounds of inconsistency.
First, while the trial judge noted that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, affirmed that the principal proceeding is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases involving companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity in International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbiter.
Second, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case isn't the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Insolvency.
Furthermore, what is certain is that, since the subsidiaries' votes were left, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the US courts, i.e. the "vault" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A fact the appeals court omitted.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation it had been facing since 2008 without addressing the severe economic crisis facing the United States, which was spilling over costs to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appellate court to have the vote taken in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance appeal will claim non-prosperity and require review of the case by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, stating that this freed it from the agreements signed by both countries to bring it up to the same level as paragraph 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
It also points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part mix-up: they beat Vitro and they beat the country.
The overall picture
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Company against the former patron of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were kept under silence for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Air Pilots has already encountered problems.
The group, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on a transaction carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust fund of the IXE bank 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were allegedly used to purchase shares in the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're laying siege to the Dragon Mart.
Gathered this weekend in a University of the Caribbean amphitheater, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mars in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast zone to oppose the monumental project, which is partly located in protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this topic is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long term homex
In order to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the real estate developer Homex has launched itself on the stock market for 500 million pesos.
This issue of securities is the first of four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competition
The new consortium, which is being formed by leading IT companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, has been created for a social purpose, and will be targeting the Central and South American clustering software services market.
The investment in this area is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The basketball globe-trotter "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation with the field and, thanks to it, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage put him in a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor league player, a member of the national basketball team, a manager and national team leader, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón, or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s", Reyes recalls during a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife of over 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life".
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The walls of his home, almost all of which are decorated with photos and memorabilia of his extraordinary journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he cherishes the most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967 onwards, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
That's a lot of years of satisfaction, including five championships between 1971 and 1975.
I retired from the championship in 1981, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was the manager here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, saying to me, "I have a big player for you, he's six feet tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy started, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He rejoiced at the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only from a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's national team responsibilities.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian referee hadn't made us play the last game again", said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we put a racket in the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won bronze in the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the 90 World Cup because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy in the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His international tournament statistics are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín has.
And that's not to mention his track record in the various leagues he's played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. They were the best players in the world.
As a young person, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
What would you say is your greatest accomplishment in the Federation?
Having been part of the national team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had as many as 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to have put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce play only in their zone and only face teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Today's young people travel and play too much when it's not necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for officers, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
I usually listen to music, watch old YouTube videos, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
The death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for playing the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a ruthless, fearful, and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and he will be sorely missed.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he had admitted to having been a heavy drinker for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made his name in television as an ordinary guy in the NBC series "The Ginny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is transformed when he discovers a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brings her home.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film credits include critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful portrayal of the deliciously obnoxious J.R. that Larry Hagman's greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing family and their relatives ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who killed J.R.?" slogan, invented to maintain suspense around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is nearly murdered, has generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars in gambling.
This, among other things, helped the series set a record for the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched the show, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in the world, behind the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which drew 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had got her pregnant and then threatened to charge her with prostitution if she didn't leave town, but other people had reasons to attack her, too.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but charismatically smiling man: a dishonest contractor and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) committed.
"I know what would be the epitaph for J.R"., Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here lives the good citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only part of him that's missing.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman as a man "huge, both on the small screen and in life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Filming of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in the works, the channel said.
As of now, neither Warner nor TNT has commented on how Hagman's death will be incorporated into the show.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 while married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stages of the New York theaters in the early 1950s and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met and married the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he released his memoir, "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I have not written anything in this book that would hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation advocate and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I give them advice, I give them confidence, I go with them when they come for surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I try to offer them a little comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's not going to be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay".
He was also an anti-tobacco campaigner and participated in several campaigns.
A class on the "End of the World" just started.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a class on the end of the world, he knew he was throwing an irresistible hook: the end of the "great recount" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many refer to as evidence of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what lay ahead in the months ahead: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have dubbed "debt Armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would unfold.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever had", Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what's going on in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, that was a very good time.
And we must remember that evil is good to those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only professor to give lectures on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker is teaching a course on "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to give a lecture, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We are adding '2012' to give us the opportunity to give the class again, in case the world doesn't disappear", said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students are required to study, create projects and take their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be taken the day before the apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The classes have proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours", Restall said of his high-level course, which consisted of 35 students.
We got emails several weeks before the semester started from people asking if there were still any openings.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to me what people are able to do to comfort themselves", says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University-Camden.
For fear of the apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, claims to have watched every apocalyptic movie.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject", he said.
I appreciate that.
But not one of the students we interviewed, let alone a teacher, told us that he believed the world would end on December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and we kind of discredited it", says Julie Zegel, a 21-year-old senior at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it's just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I will admit that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in this speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about that", he says.
This is predominantly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond when asked if he knew that classes on "the end of the world" were being held here.
"The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world", he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pope's pardon.
Restall notes that over the years, there have been many speculations about the supposed date of the Last Judgment, and he claims that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
Students and faculty take the date lightly.
Many of them told us they were thinking of going to parties "for the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call my friends and we have a laugh", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
