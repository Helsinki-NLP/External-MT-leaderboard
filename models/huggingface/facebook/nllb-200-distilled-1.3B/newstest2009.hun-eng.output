The Prague stock market went negative at the end of the day
The Prague stock exchange has corrected its losses after the sharp drop this morning.
The Czech authorities have not provided any information on the amount of the aid.
The Prague stock market, which began trading on Tuesday, continued its plunge from Monday, when it fell almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street stocks is behind the decline.
This is the market reaction to the vote of the US House of Representatives to reject the financial sector stabilisation plan.
The fall in stocks in Asia
Asian stock markets saw sharp declines on Tuesday, though some of the losses were finally wiped out by the day's indicators.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percent during the trading period but later cancelled some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but in the end, the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market has fallen 3.6 percent, according to the Taiwan stock market index.
"The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect global financial markets", noted Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets its monetary policy autonomously, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are on par with those in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says American lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and approve the financial system bailout proposal.
Otherwise, other countries are threatened with the consequences.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a financial-system bailout that would have cost $700 billion.
The legislators have thus ignored President George Bush's call for support for the plan.
Bush said the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath and the major stock indexes registered their biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones has fallen almost seven percent, the last time it fell to a similar level was in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but once it was revealed that the House of Representatives had not passed the bill, the index started to drop.
Congress backed down, so the U.S. government could pump $700 billion into the banks.
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader agreement and financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
That's going to be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
But it's not a victory yet.
Congress must finalize some of the details of the agreement before it can publish the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The financial system bailout bill is being debated in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported by Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, to Reuters on Sunday.
Senate sources say the bill is likely to be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
Economists say there should be an announcement that the bailout plan is approved, which is the first major psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, a "clean-up" takes place afterwards.
The plan must be effective.
"We've made a big step.
We have resolved our differences about what the shape of the market stabilization package should be", said Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
He says the final vote could be on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Saturday night to finalize a new government fund.
It should buy up unsellable mortgage assets from financial corporations, which are causing financial corporations to incur serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
'We are close to a final agreement on a design that will work and that must be effective in the market.
The corrective plan has yet to be completed, but I think we are there", said Paulson.
Signal to Asian trade
The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said lawmakers are now trying to get a deal through Congress by Sunday.
The move is intended to reassure investors before the Asian financial markets open, where the time zone is the first thing Congress will decide on Monday.
But it's not clear when the two chambers of Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the hearing will be held at the last minute.
Lawmakers are hoping to get the bill passed in the next few days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
At the request of President George Bush, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining $100 billion, and then $350 billion, if it feels the program is not doing its job.
Bush praised the progress in the negotiations.
While the president can veto this resolution, Congress can override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained to acquire financial assets to buy bad mortgage securities that were losing value because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages.
"We worked it all out.
The bill should be able to pass the House on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesman, said the president was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "bilateral efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of bus termination payments
The negotiators, led by Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said lawmakers agreed on accountability for the financial program, protection of taxpayers from losses, closing of the rebates, and timing of the funding bill.
The new law also limits the so-called bus termination payments of directors participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Treasury.
"We've worked very hard on this and we've made great progress toward a deal that will work and that will benefit all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to homeowners who have problems paying their mortgage.
The government should make new installments on the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly installments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Spiritual help
The proposed plan, according to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
'This is because it is impossible to know how and at what price the distressed assets will be bought back.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share losses", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Marek says it's not so important whether the plan is approved now or early next week.
"It is more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give its blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of getting agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at the moment,' Marek stressed.
Couple of knife fights, MP3 players versus cell phones.
We'll help you choose
While almost all cell phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be used to make phone calls.
It seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are many reasons why people might want to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the use and the needs of the prospective owner.
You're probably having a hard time getting a high-end, expensive record player to play that latest Maxim Turbulence record.
First, such music products do not appear on Bakelite records, but there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz, or blues records, you probably dream of a record player like this.
It's similar to traveling, which is compressed -- simplified to MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a 20-crown headset on the market.
Two extremes, with enough room for everyone.
We have a wide choice.
Battery life is also important.
Some high-quality music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but they also do what most cell phones don't even happen to be capable of.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the basic functions of calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, has a camera, a camera, and even a navigation system.
And if you factor in smartphones and communicators, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
It's a bit of a miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But there are disadvantages to multifunctional cell phones.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more times the display sends it to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-consuming activities.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
So, with cheap cell phones, you can expect them to play for you for no more than a few hours.
If you are also using your phone, get a charger for safety at work - even for more expensive devices.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the worst ones can last at least nine hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
The next problem is uploading music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto the memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in cell phones without an adapter.
With a few exceptions (iPod), players do not require any special software.
All you have to do is charge the device with music from your computer via USB.
Most mobile phones and players already create their own music library, sorted by artist, album, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only render a bit like Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to manage, phones know more
When choosing a particular device, you should first consider the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and of course the ease of use.
If you are primarily a background musician and only listen to music for a short time a day, such as on the tram, any mobile phone with an MP3 player is fine.
And any cell phone can do that.
You don't even have to pay attention to the music formats your phone or your player can play.
MP3s are all they can handle, and the vast majority of music that comes to you will be in that format.
MP3 is one of the most common formats, and most other devices can handle WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better cell phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
All you have to do is visit the relevant websites of the provider (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service alone could be a compelling argument for buying a music phone.
Unfortunately, the service providers' offerings are meager and usually limited to one-year radio camps.
The prices are also the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this kind of music sales (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever he wants to listen to something, he's gonna go check his cell phone in his pocket while his forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your earphones or at least your speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which is available on almost all mobile phones but only on a few MP3 players.
For many people, the biggest advantage of music phones is probably the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent walkman.
But most of the time, you're limited by the lack of output from a traditional earpiece.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to 15 000 kroner with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones.
The players' advantage is, however, among other things, the ease of use.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest - players (see our selection) are really something that everyone can handle.
Minimal function, the previously conventional cassette tape recorder or gramophone-like handling is obvious.
There is no threat of a crash in the form of accidentally switched on mobile Internet, nor of the enormous data bill that follows.
What to Choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
With the right credit card, you can get up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The default types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with 8GB of memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowson, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgton or Iriver.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you don't have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are a more demanding student, choose a special mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 controller, which makes them as easy to use as an MP3 player.
The most advanced in the sector was Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series mobile phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can provide the same service for the same price range up to SEK 4,000, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will be available in the Czech Republic later this year.
Maybe I should
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our operators offer practically the same services as their Western European counterparts.
However, we are missing something here - a virtual service provider that forces traditional providers to make substantial price reductions.
Maybe it won't be like this for long.
We have written on Mobil.cz many times that Czech providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in the rest of the Union.
The latest move by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges may lead to a controversial situation - some Czech mobile phone operators will have cheaper SMS calls from abroad than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, because we have three cell networks and we have a penetration rate well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed by Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Authority, who has previously stated several times that there is no room for a new operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network would probably no longer have many opportunities (although it would probably find it difficult to find frequencies).
But there's another option - the virtual service provider.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a significant price decrease, which was then also met by traditional operators.
Meanwhile, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, there were voices like ours in the UK.
However, it has been shown that such providers have a place and can be really successful.
However, we do not have to go far to find an example.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the mobile virtual service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In less than six months, the service provider managed to acquire more than 100 000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider in the country.
Mobilking is, meanwhile, backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual service providers is that they can target a much narrower target group.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure at issue is compatible with the internal market.
It does not entail relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus generally appear to be low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but often offsetting this with fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS services at a minimum of 50% cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on such a target group can be a good move.
This service is specifically targeted at men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - a service they like and trust", says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual service.
It is difficult to say whether a similar idea to Poland will work here.
The Commission notes that the Czech Republic has not provided any evidence that the measure was necessary to achieve the objective of common interest.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with the services it provides.'
No chance in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our region", Jana Studničková, spokesperson for Penta's financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure is imputable to the State.
On the contrary, they do their utmost to ensure that no potential competition arises.
GTS Novera has long been keen to launch the virtual service provider, which it intends to take a further step towards making Telefónica O2 a real competitor in the corporate customer market.
'We are very interested in providing our customers not only with wired but also with mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have re-negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations", says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
From unofficial information, it looks like we might have a chance with the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
But at the moment, his birth is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
'At the moment we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider has a place on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special, unlike other markets.
So far, we have not been contacted by a single entity with a complex and serious project in this area", Vlastimil Sršeň, from Telefónica 02's press department, told Mobil.cz.
The special situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other providers.
Martina Kemrová, a spokesperson for T-Mobile, exceptionally agrees with O2, adding: 'We have not yet identified a viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further.'
And he added, "It's unlikely that any virtual service providers will be on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
We should have a concrete agreement on the table right now to think about this short-term".
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
From a customer's perspective, that's what we consider the most rewarding.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find partners for the deployment of shared networks for high-speed mobile internet.'
Responsible offices - on the same page as service providers
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of a new operator would mean increased competition, lower prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for a competitor like that to get in?
When service providers are able to work together on something important, the link around the birth of U:fon is also evident.
The greatest pressure on ČTU was probably felt around the birth of the T-Mobile U:phone.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the CTU website.
But right now, U:fon is a good argument for why we shouldn't allow the virtual service provider in.
Martina Kemrová added: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been weakened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of a new player into the market and its services are subject to high requirements.'
However, given the attitude of mobile operators, the complete indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities is simply astonishing.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTU that is at issue here, which unfortunately has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike the UK and other developed countries.
The Competition Authority shall be the only authority to do so.
But the Bureau has a unique approach to the problem.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would only be possible after a contract for the lease of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offers of potential interested parties were probably not sufficiently attractive to traditional suppliers', said Kristián Chlapua, external relations officer at the Competition Authority.
A statement from the service providers in this way would probably not surprise anyone.
But from an agency that should represent consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one takes advantage of their market position, this is beyond strange.
In particular, as Kristián Chalupa adds: 'In the overseas countries where virtual service providers are generally active, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the fall in the price of mobile phone services.'
However, it is likely that the pressure to ensure that the market environment functions properly and to reduce prices is not in the interest of ÚOHS.
In this case, the very touching consistency of the three mobile operators' reactions is indeed shocking.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Just as gasoline prices at gas stations are identical, they are probably the result of chance and fierce competition.
'The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither provider has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately greater responsibility for its market behaviour.
The telecommunications regulator probably lacks the tools to open up the mobile market for virtual operators,' Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership is one of the many points of dispute.
There is of course an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, which shows that telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the establishment of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has, relatively logically, a monopoly on its own network.
So in a certain segment, it's necessarily dominant.
However, even if this argument were not accepted, the fact that three mobile operators behave in a remarkably similar way should be a minimum warning to the OHIM.
Meanwhile, complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera, mentioned above) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the CTU is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, which takes the CTU's hand off the whole thing.
We've seen this before in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted text of the Telecommunications Act did not translate the extension of ČTÚ's competence in the area of economic competition into telecommunications, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
The representatives of the HSE should know this, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one's watching.
In the meantime, the existence of some virtual operators, many of which are already operating on Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile phone services, which are however only partially public.
Because they're all multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to the chosen few.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the service provider, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a preferred customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a measure.
'If the cases you are talking about arose, it would be a breach of contract that we would be dealing with and that could lead to the termination of the cooperation with the company in question,' Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem.
But it is unlikely that news of such activity would have escaped the attention of the operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may have thousands of customers.
Meanwhile, no service provider is immune from such a procedure.
These companies are not negligibly profitable and, unlike the genuine virtual service providers, are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, yet only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phone and therefore cannot be used in full as a general customer of mobile operators.'
But that's what the CTU should be strangest about.
In addition, another question arises for OHIM.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to this kind of procedure, why are they preventing the birth of the virtual service provider?
It must be added that the OHIM has a relatively strong power to detect such activity and, if it does not wish to do so, it must not be satisfied with the providers' explanation that they did not foresee such an activity and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As already stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decrease in the prices of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers have been established, traditional service providers have tried to prevent their establishment to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments used were virtually identical - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulators have intervened at precisely these times, in no way protecting the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual service that others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are mixing the whole thing up.
In our experience, we cannot escape the impression that ambiguous competences are useful in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider really comes soon, the Czech mobile market may be back on track.
If one operator allows the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS cannot be indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And we may not be more expensive to call than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to four renditions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Where Is My Country?" on the day of the Czech Republic.
The anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - male or female singers, vocalists or instrumentalists.
The singers are Katerina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn's modification are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
All four versions can be heard on the iHNed.cz website.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he has deliberately selected young singers with representative voices who are expressive and popular to sing the solo variations.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep both of them and later the orchestra clear of diction, clear of text, and harmonious", he said.
The Czech national anthem is celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where is my country?" was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka's play, with music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously took it as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What's the "new" anthem?
Prague's transport company is delivering on a chip card for the first time on Wednesday.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers boarding the subway, tram and bus will have an electronic voucher in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The voucher is currently available to approximately 100,000 Opencard chip card holders.
Passengers can purchase and at the same time save on their chip cards a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) at the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The tickets can be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Agency www.dpp.cz.
By this afternoon, more than 400 customers had used the service.
Those who start using online shopping can forget about the ticket offices at subway stations, where they used to regularly stand in long lines for tickets.
The voucher can be purchased online and saved on an Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"At these places, passengers have a counter with trained servers to help them shop online and save their vouchers on their cards", said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic vouchers will be available for Opencard savings in the self-service machines in some halls.
What do these vending machines look like?
Red, they remind passengers of ticket counters and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Currently there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be 80", Opatrný added.
The coupon is checked automatically instead of by the driver
The automata, which start operating tomorrow, are easy to operate.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved by itself.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding areas.
So on the city-wide trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly serve residents of the central Czech roads to the capital.
"On trains in Prague's integrated transport system, the guides were equipped with card readers to check the validity of the tickets", explained ticket checking Filip Drapal of Ropid, the Prague public transport scheduler.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the driver's desk.
The driver must therefore not only present the chip card at the time of boarding, but also place the Opencard in a designated place on the side of the ticket office.
It's how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if a passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not use city buses and who will not remember when their voucher expires can again go to the vending machines that save the voucher on their cards.
Information on the validity of their documents will be displayed on the display of the equipment.
The Sudetenlanders wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for Šumava to be annexed by the United States.
This is shown by the letter, which is in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans approached the President of the United States with this wish.
This is also shown by a letter that survived from a private archive and is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans in Česky Krumlov are asking the US president not to allow the return of the "Schumava County" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler had seized under the Munich Agreement.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops are not coming to German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter reads, signed with the words "Men who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
Since annexation of Czechoslovakia supposedly gives Sudeten Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national character - only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the letter's authors ask the American president to take over the protectorate over Šumava "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this territory would be considered a foreign country to us, oppressing and upsetting the minority, and would do almost nothing to help the Allies win", the letter says.
The reason why the authors could not sign was allegedly fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
So if the president of the United States were supposed to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Schumacher, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in Schumacher County on whether its residents want to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the letter's text may seem a bit naive in light of current knowledge of postwar history, some historians feel that it adequately reflects the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czechs had a slight sense of their expulsion, few of them acknowledged the possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to agree to a form of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Still others hoped to simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea during the war as a German from Budějovice.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and sent to the Holocaust concentration camp, dozens of other Czechoslovak Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They were confident that when they returned home, they would benefit from the Czech language", Chalupa said.
He felt that none of the German prisoners in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported under the Beneš decrees.
You don't think, you pay.
Emotional campaign against leaders
The most expensive road safety operation in Czech history.
That's how you describe the emotional media campaign the Department of Transportation is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Prime Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, and even on flyers.
It should warn drivers about speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
It is aimed primarily at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the ads?
Emotional stories, especially human ones.
This is evidenced by the campaign slogan "bloody":
You don't think, you pay.
The phrase "not thinking" is in big letters on the license plate.
And the blood bag says "you will pay".
This should symbolize that one moment's negligence can cost one's life.
The commercials will scare viewers into 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of accident victims are regularly seen.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The commercials were produced by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, drop it for the drivers
"The drivers are under a 'pull and drop' system.
For them, the "slow down" is when they run a red light, saving time.
The "pull" is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk", says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist says.
He thinks the warning signs are less effective.
"If the warning sign is installed, it will likely quickly blend in with the environment and drivers will not take care of it", warned Kořán.
Olmert would give up almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the Israeli provisional government, spoke of returning virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published Monday by the Jediot Akron daily.
"We have to make a deal with the Palestinians, which means we have to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territory", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without that there will be no peace", he added.
He acknowledged that the eventual surrender would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and above all, not to be run over by tractors and bulldozers, as one of my best friends was, has to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to an attack in two cities in July that killed a few people and injured a few dozen.
The prime minister said it would be necessary to find a special solution to "the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" in the Old City.
"Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not going to work", he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also commented on the withdrawal of Israelis from the Golan Heights, which he considered an indispensable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
But that would require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose a peace with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they have to give up to take the Golan.
They must abandon their current relationship with Iran; they must abandon their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they must abandon the systematic support they provide to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister stressed.
Questions after an accident: Is it illegal to have a chaperone on the bus?
The law doesn't know them, you can't ride a long-distance bus
In the wake of the tragic bus accident involving the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether attendants and passengers could travel on the bus while on the road.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a chauffeur is contrary to the law on transport activities", says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The death of a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was probably caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus lane.
Unfortunately, at that moment, she was sitting next to the driver in the least safe seat on the bus, even though two more seats were reserved for her.
The bus can crash or brake suddenly even as the attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
The bus has a parking space according to the driving licence.
If the bus is not approved, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency's long-distance buses have no stops; this was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by Radim Jančura, the company's director.
"We tried to find a solution with the Ministry of Transportation, and at first they wouldn't allow passengers to move.
However, this was withdrawn and we have now decided that passengers can use the toilet on the journey if they have their own seat,' he said.
The law doesn't know the flight attendant.
'There is no clear legal regulation on the role of a flight attendant - there is no legislation regulating this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only defines the concept of driver; it does not define his rights and obligations,' adds Hanzelka, who is less clear.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations at the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has a parking space on its license.
And that's it", he says.
Buses may be urban buses with parking spaces and a maximum speed limit, or intercity buses with a maximum speed limit and a maximum speed limit, or long distance buses without parking spaces and a maximum speed limit with seatbelts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, traffic safety expert at BESIP, sees no fundamental problem with the movement of the attendants on board the bus.
"There are few dangers in continuous progress, as in a service on an airplane.
"It's not even clear when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head".
"But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like on city buses or trams.
The safety of the flight attendants must be addressed by the carrier through internal rules", he says, and he also believes that the problem is not solved from the legal point of view.
Jančura is ready to close down services
The Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer escort services.
It employs 200 flight attendants.
The manager doesn't consider their job a risk even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of flight attendant is risky, I will quit.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
It would also save money", he says.
The lack of flight attendants in their vehicles was justified by safety concerns by Alexei Litvin, the director of Asiana, which operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We have no flight attendants, we have been against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some kind of fatal injury", he told Týden.cz just a year ago.
There was an incredible tragedy.
A young flight attendant from Plzeň, who had been working for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably left the lane without using direction indicators and stopped the bus.
The bus driver suddenly maneuvered to get out of the way, but the right front of the bus hit him.
The fact that the two reserved places for the flight attendants' rest were also sold is rejected by Jančura.
"These seats are not available for long-haul flights, they're blocked".
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By compensating the girl's family, the agency is not waiting for a court ruling, but also for financial compensation from the culprit.
Amendment to the law?
In the distant future
The change in the law on the movement of cabin crew on the buses, which has been in the works for more than a year, could be a step forward for a 30-year-old group of experts from the Ministry of Transport.
"However, the group did not reach any concrete results.
Buses are not so much about speed limits on the motorway as about mobile use while driving", says Hořín.
'The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the cabin crew to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers,' concludes Hanzelka, adding that police and labour offices are responsible for monitoring the safety of buses.
The hopes of Düsseldorf are lost in Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB management to the bank's staff is not short on words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank and Frankfurt's Deka-Bank could create 'the central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group', according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would invest a permanently profitable 'competence block' in such a transaction.
Such a link could provide a decisive impetus for further mergers in the regional banking sector.
That's the reading of when a board wants to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
The uncertain WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the deadline for finding a lasting solution was close.
However, for savings bank customers, the relationship between Deka-Bank, which is famous for its investment funds, and WestLB has long been a topic - also on the Frankfurt side.
At the end of August, when presenting the half-yearly figures, Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, stated that he saw no point in merging the bank on Mainzer Landstraße with a regional bank such as Helaba or WestLB.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, half of whom are representatives of the Landesbanks and half of whom are representatives of the savings banks' associations, entrusted the Board of Directors with negotiating with WestLB on the joint business.
This may include the capital market operation or parts thereof.
However, negotiations, financial sources say, have only just begun.
Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector with its 3000 employees, is not the first to be mentioned in connection with the consolidation of the savings and loan sector.
In 2003, it appeared for a moment that Deka-Bank would merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But this tripartite covenant was nothing.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
The other two banks did not find each other after that.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of a link between Deka-Bank and regional banks was raised again and again.
However, most recently, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba, spoke out against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a need for the different public sector banks to come together.
The first link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is now expected after the elections to the Landtag of Bavaria.
That's not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure to merge increases, he may run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, it would only be a junior partner, although it has so far been significantly more affected by the financial crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which owns 85% of Helaba, ruled out a merger with WestLB earlier this year.
Without it, NordLB will remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of the individual banks fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Banking and Savings Banking Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be used to secure the future of the Landesbanks.
Finally, WestLB could be broken up, but this is not what is desired.
So the letter from the board there says that they are definitely working on a "complete solution".
How this will be matched with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank is yet to be seen.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend".
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But now Elena is here as her friend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind them, beside the five-liter Kaiser barrel, a strong-bodied bearded man demonstrates to the approximately 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest how deep sounds he can draw from his throat.
Elena first licks Luca's face, then she kisses him.
They've arrived in Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus station next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses depart at 23:45 for the destination Monaco, festa della birra, arriving at 6:30.
Three buses are mainly for Italians, the fourth is for Brazilians only.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans were already singing their flags, and the celebration began in the middle of the night.
And so loudly that it's not for Italians", says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long fur coat and wide silver-striped glasses.
He's been going to Oktoberfest for five years, and he's organized three trips this year alone.
There at night, at Oktoberfest, and home at 10:30.
Accommodation would be a waste of money, Marco says.
The cost of the trip is 75 euros, which includes Kaiser, a welcome beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Law, accident insurance and a German-speaking tour guide - Marco took a German course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already starting to go into the night on the highway to Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will soon be quiet, the passengers will be asleep.
That's good, they'll need their strength.
There are rest stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses on the 8 motorway also make a short stop before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven as planned, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already waiting.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is giving one last briefing, outlining the war plan.
First, everyone put on the yellow cap.
On the left side of the document is the inscription 'Oktoberfest' in broken letters, next to which is the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second, "When the doors of the brewery open, run", Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the back of the tent.
"Not forward, or we'll get stuck, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, but we'll spread out in the tent".
The one-litre jug costs 8.25 euros, shouts Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you're behaving yourselves.
As soon as you leave your seats, they'll take them!"
Third, "Be back here tonight at exactly 11:30".
And now we're heading for Wiesn.
Along the way, a man is using yellow hats to sign trees, signs, and even a banner of a major Bavarian populist party.
We must prepare for the retreat.
It's the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; they say 50,000 people cross the Alps and break into the beer halls, and it is estimated that 10 percent of all weekend visitors come from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, and Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, which, in its national statistics, ranks first with some 200 medical services, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British (about 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofbräu brewery was particularly popular.
Sleepless nights for the lenders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed just last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "relatively" and even included in his remarks that the German banking sector is not immune to crisis-like developments.
Because that's what happened this weekend.
Daxon listed Munich-based real estate finance company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has been granted a multi-billion-dollar loan by a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies amount to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate is only required to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
The background is the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, the state-funded Depfa lent money to long-term projects and refinanced itself for them at extremely short maturities - which is no longer possible due to the uncertainty in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio decreased moderately from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net income from cash transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while income from claims credits and fixed assets and from the settlement of special-purpose reserves for credit operations fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only the higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex post clearing costs of the transformation of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Regulation and the business for the group companies, led to a relatively modest overall revenue deficit of 16%.
The former state-owned bank first speculated in corporate real estate loans after privatisation in 1990, which were later spun off into Aeral Bank.
As the traditional state funding offered little to gain, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in private-public-partnership (PPP) projects and expanded its activities internationally.
As regards the value of the subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now has to make write-offs that have a 'substantial impact' on the group's profit and loss account, it was reported quite generally.
The fact is that no dividend was paid.
The dividend was already reduced by a third in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Depfa.
The Commission notes that the Bank has not provided any information on the financial situation of the Bank.
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has stalled as banks maintain liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance a part of Depfa's loan portfolio of around EUR 50 billion.
Hypo Real Estate states that the group's financing needs are covered for the foreseeable future by the loan and the company is protected 'from the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international financial markets'.
According to other sources, the funds ensure the refinancing until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of HRE, however, stated that Hypo Real Estate would not have to use the financial markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the BaFin consider that the marketable position of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
It gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But given the dynamics and scale of the crisis, there can be no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that the funding should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite is also true.
After the late-night news on Saturday that the bank was still on the brink of bankruptcy, even a temporary bailout failed to calm the mood.
The stock price fell by 75% to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up pretty well.
While the debt ranking in the first place was little changed, the price of the subordinated bonds declined significantly.
The crisis affects in particular the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, in a transparent manner, the maturities beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their stability in value must now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, the intensification of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis to a head with the acquisition of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are willing to support the system, the starting point is to pay fees on time.
Or it's something that's happening that almost no one is currently hoping to get out of the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports on partial nationalisation, the likelihood of a certain outcome has now become a mere legitimate hope.
Long-term lenders may have sleepless nights when deciding whether to divest their investments.
Short-term investors can nevertheless use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes due on exchange gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the tin box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to report to Tachibana High School for her first day of classes, the girls start laughing: "The German girl is totally "cavai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - she's talking about Japan in her new exchange blog.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so nervous.
I was on my way to school and I was on fire.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, on the way to Kawasaki, and it's a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my own way, but luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to study at 8:00 a.m. until 8:40 a.m. when a brief conversation with the teacher begins, the "home room".
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I did not yet have a school uniform, I wore an old hostess' skirt, a blouse, blue knee-highs, and black leather shoes.
So I was standing in front of the cathedral in this outfit, and I tried to say everything correctly: "Saionara, vo ne Sylvana "... - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy, having started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls were whispering and laughing and waving, and I kept hearing the word "cavai".
I've seen this before in my manga.
It's a Japanese girl's basic vocabulary and it means "cute, sweet".
Then I quickly fell back to my seat.
The girl sitting next to me was smiling, feeling honored to be sitting next to the exchange student.
The rest of the clock was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they ran like normal.
Everyone was talking and laughing and asking me questions that drilled a hole in my stomach - and Japanese English is quite difficult to understand.
After the break, everyone unpacked their lunch.
My host made me a lunch just like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-pack sandwiches.
I was given spicy rice, sausages, a salad of cucumbers and seaweed, fruit, and a tofu-based meatball.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks weird and tastes completely new.
The fact is, everything is delicious.
Well, yeah, except maybe the salty prune stew, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, the entrance is not just a lunch.
A girl may give a boy a handmade, artistically assembled pendant - hoping to get to know him better during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga.
I wonder if I can observe it here.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it just fascinates me".
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And to better understand comics and the culture they portray, I started learning Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to come here at some point.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and custom.
And these are very valuable here.
Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - and it is strict, disciplined, and traditional.
And because everything was so well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen".
Rats have feelings, too.
A rat or a moth runs away when it sees danger.
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals have emotions.
But how can we test whether they feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
The online magazine "Edge" has been publishing articles by prominent scientists for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE has a series of articles on the question "What do you believe to be real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has not been able to prove, and it's true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But when we look at other species and we look at questions of perception or consciousness in general, we get into difficult territory because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does what many other animals do: it pretends to be dead, runs away, or attacks.
People behave in similar ways, which some researchers have concluded is a comparative subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
Circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/ management functions).
This wide area is more highly developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other living things.
At least in aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, like our sense of who we are, or our ability to plan and make decisions, it's reasonable to assume that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature of the human nature of language is that since a large part of human experience is related to language, consciousness is often said to depend on it.
In this case, animals are excluded.
But even if consciousness were independent of language, it would certainly be affected by language, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
So it's hard to say what consciousness is like in other animals.
If consciousness is not measured as something internal and subjective, and if it cannot be analyzed by our own experience because of special hardware, then his research poses serious problems.
Most of my discussion is about the content of conscious living, but there's another aspect of consciousness that's probably more accessible to science.
The cognitive processes of animals could be studied regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in primate short-term memory experiments, especially in the case of visualization.
However, in this hypothesis, also explored by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: Both may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex in visualization.
What does this mean about emotions?
I'm guessing it's because an emotional system like fear is activated in the brain when it's aware of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we are in when the activity of a localized defense system in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) occupies working memory.
So, emotion is closely linked to areas of the cerebral cortex that are specific to primates and especially to humans.
Along with language, perception is broken down into subtle levels because words and grammar allow us to distinguish and categorize conditions to describe to others, not just ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions come from the simpler activities of the cortex and the brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Because this network hasn't changed much over human evolution, it could easily play a role in species-wide emotions.
I can't disprove it theoretically, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what seems to be fear in rats and humans is probably also felt in both cases: How could one test whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach runs away when it's in danger, does it feel fear?
In my opinion, just the same behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although neural comparisons are helpful: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, but cockroaches do not have brains.
But the brainstem is responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven in humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches, who knows?
However, I don't know how to prove it.
And because their emotions are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm more interested in the emotional behavior of rats than in their emotional emotions.
But any progress in this area is predictable at the neural level, if we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
And just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't research emotions because I don't know if they exist.
To others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I prefer to move forward rather than keep hitting walls.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, UEFA president: time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Ivan Vashyunik said that the preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees in the UEFA Bordeaux decision the confidence it has in Ukraine and the conviction that Ukraine can organise the European Championship together with Poland", Vaszjunik said.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much to be done in both countries".
Both countries are lagging behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EC stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at full speed now", said Grigory Surkis, president of the Football Association of Ukraine.
"We will be monitored by UEFA at all times".
In Poland, they were going to take an even more radical step.
The National Olympic Committee suspended the Polish PZPN Federation after a series of scandals, and replaced it with independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have written to assure Michel Platini, UEFA president, that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Championship".
Just last season, several major league teams were relegated for manipulation, and the league itself was eventually postponed.
The outraged Dennis Quaid retaliates
The actress was promoting a new film, and in the interview she talked about her personal life, and now she's had a heated argument with her ex-husband, and Hollywood star Ryan has accused her ex-husband, Dennis Quaid, of adultery.
♪ Who's got a hunch and a fight ♪
The late war of roses between Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid ex-husband and wife, two Hollywood actors who fight each other in public seven years after their divorce.
In an interview with InStyle magazine, Ryan first spoke about the reasons for the divorce last week: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me a lot of pain".
And it wasn't until after the divorce that she found out how many women Dennis had cheated on her with.
The psychic striptease was done for Ryan's press release for his new film, "The Women", which tells the story of an adulterous relationship.
Dennis Quaid responded strongly to being called an unfaithful husband: "It's terrible", the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is constantly repeating and re-reading the story of our relationship".
It is also "sad" that 16-year-old boy Jack is repeatedly "publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce brings to a child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently fathered twins.
So his answer ends with the following snippet: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy to have a wonderful family, where everything is in perfect order".
Airline tickets and hotel rooms are going down
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, air travel in Germany has become as much as 50 percent cheaper.
Airfare and hotel room rates have again risen, according to a study by travel and financial services company American Express.
The company analysed booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price decrease in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After years of rising hotel prices, accommodations in many places have become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 per cent compared with 2007.
However, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower in the period from April to June than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express attributes this to the low dollar exchange rate, which has led to "the waning travel appetite of American tourists".
The decline in hotel room rates is more likely to affect financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The rise in hotel prices in the Norwegian city of 26.3 percent is a European record.
The Commission also notes that the price of air tickets was upwards in the first quarter.
The increase in kerosene costs has meant that passengers in the tourist class have had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights that require a lot of fuel have been 29.2 percent more expensive.
Between April and June, prices for economy class aircraft decreased on average by 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, but business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9%, decreasing by 23.6% in the second quarter.
The study shows that the cost of domestic flights in Germany has been halved.
The reason for the price decrease is partly due to the slowdown in economic growth, the company claims.
The Commission also noted that the Union industry was not able to recover from the material injury suffered by the Union industry.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air travel between the USA and Europe, increases the competitive pressure.
The tense situation is illustrated by the cancellation of loss-making flights by airlines and the bankruptcy of a number of airlines in the first half of 2008 - 24 in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach by one.
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still can't find a working team.
Kristoffer Klein zooming in for deep flight for national team player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was late to the game and his lift bounced back from the goal.
His precise wording left his lips convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger hissed in the hallway leading to the Hamburg arena's booths.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physical therapist for HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying more prestige than some former players.
So your request was heard at the appropriate place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to show his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order could have been something like, "Give me the second goal".
The order was not carried out.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight", later admitted Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt also "imagined it more slowly".
The 1-0 (1:0) goal result is due to the Hamburgers' Mladen Petric's goal (11).
"It was a dirty victory", summed up Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
By Saturday afternoon, the spectators were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the sign on the projector that showed their team as the class champion.
This is gonna be a no-party birthday.
"We know where to put it", said Marcell Jansen.
He's guessing the mid-table evidence points more to the league's unpredictability than to HSV's dominance.
Although the team is slowly recovering thanks to its late-committed acquisitions - Brazil's Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern's Jansen - it is not yet brilliant.
"We need more senses and manipulation", Jol demanded.
After the vote
Wall Street is in a state of fear.
The initial reports of the bailout's failure have temporarily pushed the Dow Jones 700 points.
It was the largest single-day loss of points in history.
Then the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down by a whopping 5 percent to 10,579 points.
The technology-backed Nasdaq has fallen more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was American Express, down 14%, followed by Bank of America, down 12%.
Not a single piece of paper has strengthened.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank have fallen by almost 10%.
Just a few days earlier, he bought a stake in the bank from Warren Buffett, a large investor.
The rescue operation will provide funds for the purchase of so-called non-performing loans.
However, the amount is not to be paid at once but in stages.
In return, the State would receive share option certificates from financial institutions, which would be redeemable in case of a proper exchange rate development, reducing the burden on the Treasury.
The European and US stock markets are downward
Billions of dollars in aid to European and American banks do not allay investors' doubts.
Hypo Real Estate, the largest German bank, is falling, and the Dax is going down with it.
The Dow Jones index is falling despite a planned bailout of the financial markets by the government.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German equity index (Dax) into a deep negative.
The share value of the Munich real estate lender fell by a quarter despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank weakened by more than 20%.
The Dax has fallen below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and has scored 5,839 points, down 3.7 percent.
Stock markets around the world have been forced to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors are worried that the US government's $700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow has lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, down 3.3 percent to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to approve the bailout plan, with the Senate set to vote on October 1.
The other European stock markets are also in a similar vein: the FTSE index in London has fallen by 3.2%, while the CAC 40 in Paris has fallen by 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after its initial rally.

Dark matter affects the flight of spacecraft
A mysterious phenomenon has puzzled scientists for years, dark matter influencing the speed of spacecraft during a so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew in space for almost 18 years.
The fuel lines are freezing and he's in danger of freezing to death.
Scientists have been puzzled for years by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
A swing-by is a gravitational swing of spacecraft, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physical trick.
But what has puzzled researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave exactly as the ancient law of gravity would have them.
Instead, there are speed anomalies.
The probes will accelerate or slow down unexpectedly.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon has been dubbed the swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which views gravity as the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and he tries to explain the swing-by anomaly by the so-called dark matter that astronauts have discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be found very close to Earth", Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter was only discovered by space explorers a decade ago.
It obviously exerts a gravitational force that can be observed in other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, meaning that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that dark matter makes up about one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Egyptian tourists freed
After spending ten days in captivity, tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free again, Italy's foreign minister has confirmed.
The kidnappers in Sudan have demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shootings that preceded the hostage release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Time and again, Germans are being targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists trapped in the Sahara are free.
This was reported unanimously by the Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arab TV and the Italian media.
According to Sky TG 24 television, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our compatriots and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently examining their health status", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: An Egyptian security official said that the hostage takers had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem is solved.
The ransom has been accepted", said the official.
"The hostage negotiations were just about to begin when suddenly the surprise came".
Sudanese soldiers shot and killed six kidnappers on the Sudan-Chad-Egypt border on Sunday, and two were arrested.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which was to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily al-Mashri al-Jom, quoting a German media source, reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned for their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers release the female hostages after the ransom is paid.
The men are held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
"Led to Suicide" by Stepfather Violence
In court, a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been abusing her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has served six years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of attempted rape.
The Tarrytown Criminal Court has learned that you regularly bound your stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, she wrote, "I feel responsible for his death".
The trial found that Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at his home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound and blindfolded her before intercourse while her mother worked in a brewery.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepmother moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was revealed that Miss Randle, who had spent much of her time volunteering with the National Trust, was haunted by the horror of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, was described by her friends as "emotionally dead" and "dissenting life".
In April 2007, her father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a falling out with his daughter's stepfather, who concluded his statement in a letter: "I always bandaged and blindfolded her.
I didn't sexually harass him.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was terrible for your victim, especially if she was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family saga ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more sobering, though, is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have gone to trial".
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the effect that Stephanie's parents feel your crime has had on their daughter over the years.
If that hadn't happened, she probably would have been a hopeful, successful, happy young woman".
An official who lost vital information has been indicted
The BBC reports that a government official has been charged with breach of official secrecy for forgetting top secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on a DHS expert mission when he left two top secret documents on a train bound for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the lesser charge of violating the law and there is no suspicion of intent.
Frank Gardner, the BBC's correspondent for the Home Office, said the move was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Department of Homeland Security and the government would treat the case as an internal matter", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, was charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which deals with the withholding of information.
The prosecution has recommended that the prosecution be represented by the Metropolitan Police in the case against the official because of the sensitive nature of his work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret studies on Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was notified of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an undisclosed location.
The housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B bill
The UK housing co-operatives can expect to be in the accounts for over £80 million after the bailout of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent £14 billion protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies using depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was "annoying" that companies and their members had to pay.
The repayment of the important loan of 14 billion will eventually take place after repayment of the mortgages of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
However, the accrued interest is charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It's annoying that institutions that used to be cautious... now have to pay the bills of institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that every company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit they have, and the companies share 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates the loan amount to be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to set aside £81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, the executive director of the Housing Companies' Union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is outrageous that institutions should have to pay the bills of far less cautious institutions that were cautious during the boom in the housing market".
BSA says not a single company has gone bankrupt since they started in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks to decide how to protect the housing companies and their members from the substantial bill", Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers the period of seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full year's interest, which can be up to twice what it is now.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organizations without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest on their deposits.
The price of milk goes up by five pence a liter.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy Company announced that it will raise the wholesale price of milk by another five pence a liter from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-penny increase in February and a survey by a consulting firm.
Resellers themselves decide whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former MP's request for release was denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for the release of former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court denied him a parole hearing on charges that he extorted 50 million takas ($729,700) from a businessman while a member of parliament.
This case is just one of countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her Awami League party is demanding that the country's army-backed interim government first grant her full freedom.
According to reports, although he was released on parole to go abroad for medical treatment, the terms of his release do not make it clear whether he will be able to remain free when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he's now going to appeal the appellate court's decision to the Supreme Court.
"The court of appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request on the grounds that it was not necessary as she was already temporarily released and undergoing medical treatment abroad", said lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal".
His lawyers argue that he needs a bail defense to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was detained last year after a military-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to seek medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 Afghan children have been left out of the recently launched polio vaccination program because of Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the UN organized a vaccination drive in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or impede the work of thousands of staff who were administering the vaccine.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV dismissed
BskyB's appeal against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its stake in its rival broadcaster, ITV, was dismissed.
The Court of Appeal for Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
The Commission had previously found that BSkyB's participation distorts competition and gives it an unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BSkyB's purchase of shares from ITV threatened ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Committee to open an investigation.
Virgin's CEO, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom regulators all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of ITV's stake was a meaningless and disproportionate compensation - especially since BSkyB had stated that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
Another investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 firings of nine U.S. Attorneys.
The move followed a report by the Justice Department's inspector general on the case that criticized the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez.
The investigation was ordered because there was a fear that the prosecutors were fired for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, Special Counsel, will now investigate whether any of the officials interviewed in the investigation attempted to obstruct justice by lying.
"The serious charges, including possible crimes, have not been investigated or clarified", said Inspector General Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who would have the power to compel witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys from their positions by the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, they said the prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the fired prosecutors were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many to conclude that the firings were politically motivated.
Some prosecutors participated in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are government agents who investigate and prosecute cases.
They may be removed at any time, but not for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General, came under attack for the dismissals and eventually resigned.
Several other officials in the Justice Department have also resigned.
In his report, the inspector general was highly critical of Gonzales' role in the case, saying the attorney general bore "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, "resigned" his leadership role and "significantly withdrew" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to the elder Bush, have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic is getting credit
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive a tribute at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive a special gold medal next week at a ceremony in London, said he was honored to receive the recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations at this year's awards, with four nominations.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genre, and 'Bat Out Of Hell' is one of them".
The song that Jim Steinman got was a very loud voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
Released as a single in 1979, it reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" remained on the charts for almost nine years and sold over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, real name Marvin Lee Aday, has been battling health issues, including heart surgery in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute gout.
Later, it was discovered that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
An unfamiliar city street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, roundabouts, and other side streets, some famous, others merely practical.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about 30 feet wide and 36 feet long, and it's more like a dusty alley than a major traffic route.
There are no street signs.
It's practically impossible to find on a standard map.
But the street has its admirers.
There's, for example, Avalon Bay, a newly built First Street luxury condominium complex.
He wants to re-cover Extra Place and make sure the shops and boutiques in the new buildings can be accessed by a cleaner road.
Admirers of the street include longtime residents who were caught up in the rough streets because it was the only vestige of the neighborhood's pre-renovation past.
However, the owner of the street, the city's Department of Building Conservation and Development, is not interested in sticking to it.
This month, at a meeting of the county's zoning board, city and Avalon Bay representatives submitted a proposal for the developer to purchase the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street remain under city control and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, district manager of Municipal Council No. 3.
"There is very little land left in the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the city", he said.
"We may have some suggestions for renovation and management that Avalon can do, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public".
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced plans to re-cover the alley and provide seating, some of which would be used as a café, for which the developer is expected to lease a lot.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the street was first announced at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company would like to use the street, it is not insisting on ownership.
"The main objective of Avalon Bay is to renovate this ruined alley and turn it into a pleasant public space", he said, adding that the city had proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office of Building Conservation, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the office's job is to develop the buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has little historical significance.
Some say it was named "no man's land" in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back exit of the punk rock landmark, CBGB, which closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most famous for being the location of the photograph on the cover of the Ramones' album Rocket to Russia.
"It was a great venue", said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, clothes, barrel and poster pieces, and leaves and ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how he took over the middle-class East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the community's possession.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Weeping: A Bitter Nostalgia of the City's Dying Process"), posted a portion of the Extra Place story that appeared in the "City Rumor" column of The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, small cul-de-sac, dark even in the daytime, bordered by rusty, iron storage doors and slate windows, and where weekly newspapers are carried by the wind through the sewers".
The street, with a few exceptions, looked exactly the same as a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street at the end of the back door that used to lead to CBGB, but now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store that was built in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 75-gallon beer bottle laying next to a pile of discarded, fresh newspaper.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it could use a renovation.
Fields said he felt that some underestimated the appeal of the street in its present condition.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, wet, and disgusting places", he said.
The debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section of Education Observer, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California studies and senior director of education research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, is co-author of "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
It's not easy to please the voters from the Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's education proposals are part of that.
The Obama campaign said that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", and it's true.
To address these differences in achievement, the Obama Education Plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
However, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in schools that do not use English, overrides his interest in addressing the large performance gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep charter elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the students at the school are Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students - many of whom have recently arrived - are learning English.
Yet, 100% of the fourth graders scored extremely high on the 2008 state math test.
Equally impressive, 93% of fourth graders scored extremely high on the English language and literature test.
This incredible achievement was not achieved with the tool Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street emphasizes repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and the rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is to "fully immerse" English students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We have had overwhelming success in making it impossible for anyone to walk into a classroom and recognize the student who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier".
"It works", he said, "it works for us".
Would Obama set an example for other schools that have a significant number of Hispanic and English students to follow, like Sixth Street Prep?
The school's performance should make the answer clear, but because of his own party's education policy (the National Education Association has long supported bilingual education) and because he himself is a consistent advocate of bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently made a disparaging comment on the issue, saying that people should not be so concerned about legislation "being purely English".
Instead, he said, "you should get your kids to speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the disparity in outcomes, he should seriously study the models that work, instead of looking down and ignoring them.
Renewed economic concerns have led to a sharp drop in oil prices
Oil prices plunged sharply on Monday amid concerns that America's bailout plan for financial markets will fail to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell seven percent to $99.80 this morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock market has been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and several powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting $145.29 a barrel in July, prices plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before being squeezed back into the unpredictability of financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again gripped by concern, even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached a deal over the weekend for the largest economic bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would be long in coming.
In the latest development in the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, the government announced Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts say that as a result of the desperate negotiations over the weekend, "the bailout appears to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, such as oil, is expected to decline.
"The future of the stock, interest and foreign exchange markets has become uncertain worldwide", wrote an analyst at Deutsche Bank to investors.
"We believe that the commodity market will not escape the 'epidemic.'
From the point of view of commodity markets, the biggest question is to what extent the US "disease" is infecting the whole world, especially China".
As oil consumption declined due to slowing economic growth, bank analysts cut their forecasts for next year by 20 percent, cutting their forecasts for 2009 for oil and gas prices.
With a second-quarter bravery, the team set a new record.
After spending more time on the Jets' jersey than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals' home game was in perfect harmony with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, setting up a perfect foreplay for an afternoon in which their evolving partnership has evolved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes this quarter, including one when two cornerbacks fell in a row with 10 seconds left in the half.
"I didn't regret the effort", Favre said of all the passes he gave Coles.
"Hell of a player.
We've always been able to communicate well, regardless of what people think".
While Favre and Coles were playing, the defense stopped Cardinals manager Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, caught a bad throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safety, intercepted another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to get the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing move of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball with 10 seconds left and the Jets took it, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to make it 34-0.
That was the best Jets score in a quarter.
When Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to describe the game's mind-blowing nature, he said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When told that both were scored by the Cardinals in the third quarter, 21 points to none by the Jets, Mangini said: "I have to say, I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
We've got a lot of points in a short time".
The rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why he is considered by many to be the greatest middle- and long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first man to run the 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a comfortable flat track victory in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved by 27 seconds on his previous mark of 2:04:26 set last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set a career-high 26 world records in so many different distances that he had won world championships or set world records at almost every distance, from the 1,500 meters to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympics marathon for fear - in retrospect, perhaps a little too cautious - that air pollution would further aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he entered me for the Berlin Marathon.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny, at first 9°C, then 13°C - Gebrselassie won Sunday with an incredible 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since marathoners who had not started before, such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat, have switched to longer distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the last decade, since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 1998 with a time of 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, he wrinkled both legs and was unable to train for two weeks.
Obviously, he was refreshed during the forced rest and not rusty.
"I'm so pleased", Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything worked out perfectly.
A week ago I started training again, and today I had doubts, but in the end everything worked out".
He has received some criticism - particularly from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for using too many props in his races, usually avoiding many world-famous marathoners, relying on his sprinters as if he were running on a track, and putting world records ahead of the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie's greatness in the long jump.
Gebrselassie crossed the finish line Sunday with four Kenyan sprinters in 1:02:04.
Two leading Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the pace after the sprinters were exhausted.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie overtook Kwambai by one final sprint, finishing second in 2:05:36, improving on his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with her seventh fastest time of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by Paula Radcliffe of Britain in 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised the world by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
He was unable to compete in the Beijing Olympics due to a reported back injury, but recovered quickly and won the Berlin Marathon, improving his individual best by five minutes.
He won the race by clever calculation, first allowing a four-man team of Ethiopians and Kenyans to break through and gain a significant lead, then following them after about 20 miles.
Ethiopia's Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenya's Helena Kiprop finished third with a time of 2:25:01.
A segregated city, black pride and trials
In the Greater Orlando theme park, a few miles from everything shiny and loud and mighty, lies a quiet little town, where the pride and complexity of the African-American experience was born.
Eatonville, the first all-black city to be integrated into the country, and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was in 1935: "Five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas, and two school towns, no jail".
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have all attended the annual Zora Festival, a series of celebrations in Eatonville honoring Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways the city he described and made a tourist attraction - which is also featured in a Florida guidebook published by the Federal Writers' Project of the Depression - is separate from its surroundings.
It is as independent, dignified, and withdrawn as it was in the 1930's, when, as Hurston wrote, Florida's urban blacks were often unwilling to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing".
Even in a year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama is encouraging open discussion on race, many here are wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We take great care in how our story is told", said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a lifelong resident of the area and a member of the city's oldest church.
"You have to tell it right".
Eatonville has long been known for its paradox of victory and struggle.
It's both a historic model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 people with poverty rates twice the national average.
Partly a literary hub, partly an example of the American slave culture, sometimes despised, sometimes praised, Southern, urban, black culture that thrives in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the people here are both proud and defensive.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (that's how everyone here calls Hurston).
In books written in a sincere, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida Roadmap transformed the town, which lies along Route 17, from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, as brave as a drum in life and literature, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then to the more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road is the modern public school, with a brown base with a white border, with neatly kept courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller maintains, though he can hardly read or write".
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of liquor and anything that might be needed in the temporary accommodations".
So in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Clearly, Fodor's travel guide said otherwise.
That description really didn't sit well with everyone.
"Zora told things as they were", reported 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's daughters, who were immortalized by Hurston's quotes from the slick songs men sang about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that".
Hurston is still remembered as a lively stranger who visited often after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a booming Chevrolet, smoking and wearing long pants in a town where people still pride themselves on their dignified dress.
Most people were charmed by it, Franklin said, but many were disillusioned.
"People were always happy to see Zora", Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he rocked his chair and added: "He never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were never published again.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about him.
Although she was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived before.
There were no major commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us", said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, "Wrapped in a Rainbow".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city to replace the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 interstate on the city's western border.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, among other things, has ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950's, the struggles over racial mixing were tearing the community apart.
"Then a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at people sitting on the side of the road", Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died from this.
They threw a pumpkin out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to require forced integration, saying of Brown v. Board of Education that it was "more offensive than respectful of my race".
Today, residents say that while segregation in schools has been positive in some ways, it has weakened the unity of Eatonville and undermined the self-esteem of young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - and the teacher was hugged morning and night", reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of Save the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
"It took as long as the students and teachers were from the same place", he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because she was a white teacher - I mean there were cultural differences between us", Nathiri said.
But human rights helped to elevate many other Zora Neale Hurston writers, actors, and artists who rose above prejudice, as she did, with optimistic confidence and lines like, "How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?
It's beyond my comprehension".
In 1975, Alice Walker visited Hurston's unmarked grave and began a fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared on bookshelves, once again elevating him to the top of the American picture book industry.
The road project was to begin just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community started a Hurston festival to show what the county would destroy with the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the celebration every January since then.
A few years later, the county withdrew its proposal to build a road.
"The five-lane highway has revived the community, bringing it to full speed, which is a real pride of citizenship", Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the road project helped change the city's image of itself.
More and more out-of-towners, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started attending church here in 1993, and the locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
In 2006, the new, one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened on the newly re-lined and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains a Florida cockroach's egg: it's only six miles from downtown Orlando, but sometimes you feel like a suburban back street in the summer rainy season; as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
They still treat outsiders with caution who come here looking for a story to tell about Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest mural, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working the land - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville - including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly drawn to bright red - fear that their segregated community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew in popularity, so did the pride of the hometown.
Young people in particular are increasingly seeing Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with its problems and all, neither better nor worse, as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and confused as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
Sincere civic engagement is echoed in the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to take a job with a local government or police department that he believes needs help.
And it seems that even younger people have learned to properly describe Eatonville, like the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just pass through here think this town is nothing compared to the rest", said Alondra Kenon recently after church on a Sunday.
"But if you stop and take a moment to learn about its history, it's a very beautiful city".
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the newsstands and the huge TV projectors in Times Square, they wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They'd never know that with their glass-walled, bee-shaped offices above them, the bankers and hedge fund managers who control New York are having their worst day since 1929.
The couriers still drive their metal tea trucks along the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins to the morning meetings.
Still, Spanish-speaking men creep through the blockhouses, carrying, like human mules, some 50 iron shirts that hang from a yoke-like hoop over their shoulders.
Office workers still queue at the sidewalk food trucks for their morning sweet pastries, and it's still impossible to catch a cab between 4 and 7 p.m. on a weekday.
I didn't feel that there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon when, despite all the foreboding news, I decided to open a new bank account.
I had deliberately planned to do it during the afternoon break at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase Bank, but there were already 20 people in line in front of me.
Not at the cashier's window, where money can be withdrawn or deposited, but at the customer service counter, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to Macy's, and new customers open a bank account.
Many before me, I learned later from Starr, the banker "appointed to me", had lined up with the same intention.
However, unlike me, they've already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their home states, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They withdrew money from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and supposedly treat their customers like family members.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, has gone bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a $440 billion bailout buyer.
The office and store workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed a safe haven, the bank that makes the most capital injection purchases on Wall Street.
The common people of New York have become experts in finance in the last few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese department store was talking on the phone about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she was complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, 50-year-old janitor of my block, switched the subject, not Brad and Angelina or my food delivery, as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank: "I have invested all my savings in financial instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria slid to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, where the organization "Vars Against the Conquest of Islam" was presenting.
They were marched with signs that mimicked traffic signs that showed mosques crossed by red lines.
Police say far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Austrian Muslim cemeteries, which happened the same weekend that far-right parties made a significant advance in the country's parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Trauni cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the graves, but investigators say they were only trying to hide their extremist motives, which stem from hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear if the incident is connected in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" to hear of the desecration, which occurred shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is taking a leap of faith after yesterday's parliamentary elections, in which the political balance of power shifted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were branded xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18% of the vote, has also expressed his dislike of the campaign against headscarves and burqas, as well as food allegedly linked to Islam.
At the party's final congress in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" that would prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election of the far right show that the change was largely due to a young voter base that is worried about its future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign trip.
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child molestation, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the courts.
The judges ruled against Glitter after he informed the authorities of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after presenting evidence to the court regarding Glitter's convictions for child abuse.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Magistrates' trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police filed a request with Ashford Magistrates Court to block Paul Gadd's planned trip to France and Spain on March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not appear in person".
Glitter, 64, notified authorities of her intention to travel abroad because she was required to do so by the Sex Offenders Registration Act.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you don't notify the authorities, you could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they don't want to talk about his unique cases in Glitter County and his possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "The Kent Police are doing everything they can to protect children at home and abroad.
'We believe it is easier to control someone if they do not leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system in place to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The Kent Police Department believes that protecting the people of Kent is the most important task, and we work closely with them to monitor the behaviour of all registered sex offenders and those living in the county to minimise any risk to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
However, he claimed that he was unwell and refused to fly to London.
The authorities in the country refused to let him pass the passport examination, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to let him enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where local police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport's Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to court in Uxbridge, west London, following a court order to register him as a sex offender at the request of Scotland Yard.
Glitter previously served four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possessing child rape photos.
According to a Home Office source, Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary, was relieved and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal side".
No decorations, no hair, and no dancing shoes.
The flamenco masters up close, without the excitement of performing, so you can get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the common man.
And these two sides cannot be separated except in those intimate moments away from the audience, when we can sense a personal gesture, grasp the depth of a gaze caught, or marvel at the beauty of the hands of an artist who is not exactly preparing for a performance.
In his series of photographs Flamenco-people, German artist Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the masters.
Through the photographs, he presents the distinctive iconography of flamenco from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco", says the artist, adding that Flamenco-people "could be anyone's character, because the viewer is struck by the images that do not represent the artists in a typical way.
These people who are getting the lens on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy onto the stage... and captivate the audience.
But the stage photography is not the way to capture their personalities.
Their personality and character lie deep within their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personalities of the great flamenco figures with the help of the camera".
The Cante de las Minas Festival gave Bauer a boost in his long journey in 1997 to capture flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc-based camera.
These portraits, with their camera and subject matter, are reminiscent of classic photography.
The use of various stylistic devices, however, breaks with traditional pictorial representation and suggests modernity. Bauer's idea of flamenco is faithfully expressed in the following words: "It is a music with traditional roots, but one that changes day by day and is always fascinating".
It is not the dance, nor the singing or the music itself, but rather the personality, the character of the artist that fascinates the audience.
The main theme of the works on view at El Fotómata Gallery these days is the search for an encounter with the essential, the artistic magic that becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and representation.
The names of well-known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the hallmarks of this collection of almost sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be released as an album of portraits featured in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" series ("SportARTproject").
Although the Flamenco people have a slightly different concept, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a moment or two.
In my opinion, the most difficult art of photography is portraiture.
People you meet, personalities you meet, people you don't even know, or who only take a few minutes to photograph.
But even under these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my vision come true.
The exhibition, entitled Flamenco-people, a selection of contemporary flamenco portraits, is on view at the El Fotómata Gallery at 20 calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "a bit of a dare"
The setting and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on his new novel, starring an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who has lived in the Congo for 20 years and has also traveled to the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning author admitted at the Hay Festival in Segovia yesterday that his current work is "totally daring" and "all signs point to the fact that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope to put an end to it someday", he concluded at the Aqueduct Festival of Ideas, Thought and Opinion, which has hosted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors for four days.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the literary festival and fulfilled the expectations.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award, voted for by the audience, for an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Mutual Friend".
After the greeting of Félix Romeo, he was greeted by a devoted audience, and the hour soon passed when the Peruvian writer told with an amazing memory and a great dose of humor how his passion for reading and his desire to live life had developed into his writing career; how he filled the gaps with a disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, many corrections and rewrites; how his writing career was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what memories his stories are based on.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it is impossible to measure or demonstrate how books change our lives, but added: "I do not think that literature is a mere diversion or a glamour experience", because it affects people and makes them think, and therefore he asked writers not to be seduced by ease and to take responsibility for their profession.
The weather is so bad that the farewell party in Pozoblanco is cut short and the bullfights are canceled.
The bullfight, traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco festivities, was cancelled yesterday morning after the bullfighters found the arena unsuitable for the match.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfight.
The weather conditions severely affected the festivities, as two of the three events could not be held.
The second bullfight was canceled on Saturday because of rain.
The future stars, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, were supposed to fight the bulls of Castilblanco.
So they only had bullfights on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as trophies, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic fight, he was carried on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won several accolades and trophies for his two bulls, but he earned them from the crowd rather than his own performance.
However, El Juli followed, contributing little to the aging reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable run with the second bull, most of the crowd was pulled out of the fray.
In his truck, a two-ton truck of hashish tried to escape from a traffic stop.
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police carry out traffic controls in the administrative area of Armiñón (Álava).
Authorities stop a van with two passengers trying to escape the action.
The shipment, over two tons of hash, was also not conspicuous.
Investigators pursued the passengers and arrested one of them, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., the Basque government's Interior Department said.
The man arrested is charged with drug trafficking and forgery.
The incident occurred in the administrative area of Armiñón, where traffic control officers from the Alava traffic police were conducting a traffic check on the N-1 motorway.
When the van was about to be stopped, the driver refused to obey, suddenly accelerated, and left the checkpoint.
The investigators chased the vehicle, which stopped a few miles away in the parking lot, and the passengers fled off the highway into a wooded area.
The Basque Regional Police finally arrested one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily van, seized its consignment of 2178 kilograms of hashish.
The hash balls that filled the back of the vehicle were taken by the police to be tested and the drugs weighed.
In addition, the inspection showed that the vehicle's fake license plate does not match the data in the van's documents, so the arrested person is also being prosecuted for forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police are continuing the investigation with the aim of both arresting the other suspect who, as we have already mentioned, fled the highway and determining the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was taken to the police station for the necessary interrogations, and within hours the court proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence.
Heather Locklear, the actress behind the hit show Melrose Place, Amanda, was arrested by police in Santa Barbara, California, over the weekend for driving under the influence.
A witness said he was trying to leave a parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
According to the witness, at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pushed the gas to the floor, squealed on the engine, tried to leave the parking lot back and forth, and walked over his sunglasses several times in reverse".
A short time later, a witness who probably didn't recognize the actress at first saw Locklear pull over on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "concerned for Locklear's life".
When police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed traffic on the highway.
"He seemed distracted", so the patrol took him to a drug and alcohol testing center.
A police spokesman said the actress was cooperative and alcohol use was ruled out almost immediately, and the spokesman also said that the officers' first impression was that Locklear was under the influence of drugs.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unidentified substance and taken to the local jail around 7 p.m. where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear was released from an Arizona sanatorium two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, secretary general of IU and representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the union will decide on the case of Francisco Manuel Silva, former youth and sports minister of the Seville municipality, who resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to provide benefits to his family members.
"I am a federalist in these matters and this is a matter for the Andalusian organization", Llamazares pointed out, pointing to the procedure the party must follow against a former member of the Seville city council.
The IU President stressed that 'transparency' was a key consideration when it came to detecting any irregularities committed by Silva: 'The IU has always strived to ensure that cases of this nature are as transparent as possible.'
He added that training includes "a strict code of ethics for civil servants".
"May Blood", by Garcia, epic work
Benito Pérez Galdós's National Episodes was inspired by José Luis García, who recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish in Blood of May, the most ambitious work of his filmography, with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
In this way, the director has tried to illustrate the humanity and social analysis that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, as he told the audience of actors today at the film premiere, accompanied by Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The two-and-a-half-hour May Blood will be released in cinemas on Friday and later in the day will be shown as a four-hour miniseries by Telemadrid.
José Luis García, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, has fulfilled his childhood dream with this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events of 2 May in Madrid.
The 15 million budget, financed entirely by the Autonomous Community of Madrid, was a unique opportunity for García to present, in a time-honored set and costume, "the confused Spaniards who, by mistake, had chosen the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence had pushed the country into a huge backwardness under Ferdinand VII", he said.
The director, however, regretted that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's Phantoms, which more than doubled the budget of May's Blood, and had to omit some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, he co-wrote with Horacio Valcárcel.
So the director of "Restart" went to his usual method of working, shooting scenes with actors he had already tried out before filming, and casting was not because Garcia considered it "humiliating" and because, as he put it, "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and the movies to find out what's going on in the industry we work in".
It's not the first time that several actors of Blood of May, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, have stepped in front of their cameras.
Garcia, who has four Oscar nominations and one Oscar, believes that none of the nominees representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy this year, namely May's Blood, Seven French Billiards and the finalists Blindspin, represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented", he said.
Garcia's not expecting any awards for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that it's all about success, and then you're happy to have another movie made", says Garci, who has had a 30-year professional career.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Sevillian dancer Torttola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville is a tribute to another flamenco dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola was born in Valencia, in the Triana district, to a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela).
She was a freestyle dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
During her life, she was a pioneer in the fight for women's equality, whether it was Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought against the restriction of women's freedom to wear a belt.
She sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in wartime Europe, and her life fascinated Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and he recommended me Tortola, whose personality really impressed me".
The flamenco dancer stated: "Our goal is not to tell your life story but to capture your soul.
The titles of her dances remind me of flamenco styles.
For example, the "butterfly dance" is the guajira, or the "serpent dance" is the tango.
"I danced in a sensual way, and others say that's my style", she says.
The show is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, who is now singing again in Isabel's performance after Open Door; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde will play the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you've accepted my invitation, I'm very honored to have you in my play".
In addition, the production features musical directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; drummer El Pájaro, bassist Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays a constant character that constantly besieges the real diva with his love".
The play largely follows the life of the woman, who lives in London, but also travels through Europe and even to what were then distant landscapes, including India, the United States and Italy.
"I wanted to remember him because his personality had a great impact on his time, but today his work is not known and appreciated as much as before", says Bayo.
The show starts tonight at 8:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" will be published.
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be shown at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of the series of programs entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of both.
Thus, the closing chord of the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-issue of the said work, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the memorial house of the Nobel Prize-winning poet and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That luminous pine tree".
The Cultural Committee of the Regional Government of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the Diary of a Newly Married Poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
It's not as attractive as America without Paul Newman.
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that".
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman on the film Victims of the Affair, and reflects the shock and helplessness that Newman's death caused in the American film industry and across America.
How hard it was to get the Oscar.
He retired in 2007.
and he was known to be ill,
But still, everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and I just lost a good friend", said Robert Redford, tearfully, "his presence has made my life and this country better".
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
A hero of cinema and of the country, he passed away in a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, and a desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are tough and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people left to look up to, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he was the true epitome of Plato's ideal of beauty and justice.
He was Richard Nixon's arch-nemesis and champion of lost and won causes, from the anti-drug foundation he established in memory of his firstborn son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his home-grown organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was struggling to overcome its suicide-eating culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration swept across Hollywood, regardless of nationality or background.
The last James Bond, Daniel Craig, the Englishman, said that not a man but an era died with him.
Another Englishman, Academy Award winner Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He raised the bar very high for all of us", observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few today who tries to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle of demanding honesty and a serious, off-camera privacy.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is a role model.
He was divorced once, but then he lived a faithful marriage to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, although he certainly had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why eat a hamburger elsewhere when the roast is waiting at home?" he joked.
He's proud in heaven to have his daughters on earth as fans, which is not very common in America.
"In all his roles, he was proud of his role as a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted humanitarian", says the report.
The rough road to the Madrid Olympics
It is indeed a dream of many of us to have the Olympics in Madrid, and after the 2012 Olympics failed, it may be 2016.
But I ask you, are we really ready for this?
Because if we start from yesterday's race, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of the many I've ever been in.
It was a load of nonsense, and if I were to be the one to evaluate it, and I was the examiner, it would be a clear failure.
But let's go in order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the number being taken, which made it necessary to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at once (including the chip, avoid standing in the back row).
That's not what happened.
First, they only gave me the serial number (first nonsense, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual line of work), surprisingly, it was only an S-shirt (second nonsense, because I am exactly XL)!
What kind of world are we living in?
Or did the recession make them decide to save on material and just buy cheaper, smaller-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still blurry compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go there so early to pick up the chip, the line took 15 minutes from arrival and even the backpack had to be delivered.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started and we didn't even give up the backpack, and when we did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40-minute wait, which was marred by rioting and stand-off attempts, even more pleasant.
I think we're about 500 people in for pneumonia tomorrow, and some of us, myself included, are not gonna get our position with our actual time, because I'm assuming my chip recorded the departure incorrectly.
If you asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of it by accident, of course.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft unveiled the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a type of not-so-intelligent artificial intelligence that can perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a vehicle that travels on company property) based on information heard from a conversation.
Using a camera and a face- and figure-recognition system, this "receptionist" can detect how many people are in the room, who they are - even what they are wearing - and listen in and understand keywords.
You can also group people based on conversations.
In the video presentation, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that he is not a member of the company she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if she has been visiting someone and assures her that he will come to her aid soon.
All without the big blue screen.
It's really impressive.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about Microsoft changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and have fewer add-ons.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers ran only the necessary programs instead of all the commercial junk, then machines would be five times faster -- good job, Steve, that's something.
They invented Spanish wax because Microsoft has added new features and extras to Windows in every version.
The change of course is reversible.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is getting more and more out of the picture, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome came online, I joined the theory that Google was taking the first step to compete with Windows.
Many people have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of an operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element in the hardware-software dialogue.
It's the same role your wife or husband has when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but you have to expect the "death" of the operating system, not in an absolute but relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
You turn on your computer just to open Firefox or Explorer or Chrome, and you spend more time browsing than you do in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 should be much, much less than Vista.
It's less heavy, less burdensome, less complicated.
Microsoft aims to integrate its services online rather than in the past and to eventually be an alternative to Google.
And I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken earlier this month in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond.
There's a sign on the soda machine telling them to use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week, they announced the release of a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It's not coming in early 2009, it's coming in late, in fact, it's coming in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to release Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, mobile phones are increasingly functioning as computers.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely hurt their business.
The Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it's a staple of the gay shopping crowd.
And while we're on the list of specials, we might as well mention the peaceful figure of the traveling circus' duck-whiskered weightlifter.
But what are we talking about? Nothing but a typically short, armless, male cotton shirt.
I mean, the tank, as the Anglos call it, but the Marcel de Bruxelles is unrivaled by any rival.
First, because of his elegant name - though he is referred to as "Marcel" among his friends - which is due to the sport, as legend has it that he was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel is also distinguished from its competitors by its high-quality cotton material, unisex sewing, distinctive emblem and small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which is carried hidden in the collar of the most fashionable models.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports jackets, retro boxers, cashmere cardigan, wool pants, navy shirts, doll suits, miniatures, and more - all are among the company's products.
And they all fall into the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it's unfortunate that they have to be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother; it doesn't matter who the father is".
He's very much like his brother, but he's also accomplished himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
The Cruz sisters are trying to get more involved in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling is about more than some pretty, beautiful girl naming something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris and the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's a warm, tender feeling.
What are you doing in Paris, anyway?
We're going to present Mango's new fall/winter collection, which my sister Penélope and I have designed, and we're also going to be presenting the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the Valentino gala dinner at the Opera.
It's a busy day, I admit, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season with Mango, so where did you get the inspiration for your new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we learned a lot from them.
And then, I often just walk around the city and watch the women dress, and the way they vary and select their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You're a dancer, an actress, a fashion designer, you're a woman of many talents, right?
I think so, but ultimately, these three things are connected because they have so much in common.
I was interested in clothes from a very young age, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and look in my aunt's closets.
Well, that was Canaan, almost as big as an amusement park.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to be careful about what I dressed as.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for the lessons and rehearsals, to feel good about looking in the mirror.
And in an acting role, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
See, everything is connected, and I have every respect for the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no, not at all.
I'm feeling better than I've ever felt. I love the '30s.
I think women really do get there, they're more experienced and they make fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't bother me.
Since I was a child, I have done what I wanted to do, and it has brought me great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
And as for the father-to-be, it doesn't matter who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's talk about the cinema, you made a lot of films last year that haven't even been released.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, I'm very impatient and anxious, I want everything right away, but of course I know that's impossible.
I can't wait to see The Last Hour and The Search for the Tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you debuted on the runway a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she just invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which she was hosting for her organization, Women for a Better World, and I picked two of my own Mango collections, and the clothes that were on display were auctioned off, and the proceeds were donated to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know what kind of a person Naomi is.
There's so much that's been said about him, I know him, and I can assure you, not half of it is true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of his activities.
You asked me to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if you wanted me to stand up straight, I would.
If the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I know what's impossible.
Repeat drunk drivers will be forced to wear "Alcolock"
The Home Office would require drivers who commit three DUI offences to install a device to prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or not blowing into the device.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office, which says the pilot project will last for a year.
As the project aims at restoring the vehicle to service, the driver will also have to take a refresher course in traffic education.
The pilot project will involve the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation for the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA).
Statistics show that 30 to 75 percent of repeat DUI drivers get back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, since the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air that is blown in.
The cost of the instrument over EUR 1000 would be borne by the infringer.
A 2007 study in the United States showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments can reduce the number of infractions by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 lives a year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: first, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal offence,
The Commission has also proposed a new legal framework for the implementation of the reforms, which will be implemented in the medium term.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has been installed in some industrial and public vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which, following the French model, calls for the system to be installed in school buses.
In Mexico, with closed shoes
At 5:40 p.m. in the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juarez Airport in Mexico City, the Spanish Air Force transporting the Duke of Asturias's Party landed.
The sun was setting, but it was still so hot that we could see the royal couple leaving the plane using only our hands as a pair of binoculars.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other dignitaries.
A few hours before, I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Duke and Duchess were coming to town on an official visit.
- Great, so there's no airport transfer for a while...
- No, no, sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something.
But the Mexican press, they know all about the couple from Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting on the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon formed by 27 marines who protect dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a navy blue dress, and then the Princess, with her long hair blown in by the wind, her clothes restrained, but not in her usual shiny shoes - perhaps warned that Mexico City was in for a storm.
They stop for a moment, smile for the cameras, and then they enter the room where the official reception will take place.
At the gate of their hotel - one of the city's four largest - a gossip reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
The most valuable fashion prize
The best place in the world to present a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and of all the fashion designers alive today, the most sophisticated and coolest is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote young fashion talents internationally.
The grand prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own designer's clothes in the Mango display at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
It is, by the way, the company's second largest store in Europe and recently opened on its 1,335 square meters.
The biggest store is in London.
Amidst the event and the thanksgiving for Valentino, the chairman of the jury, we finally found ourselves at a lavish dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most delightful Chagals, the gala dinner was even more spectacular with the chair table prepared by Mango.
Nati, who had come with a heavy heart and sadness over the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some breathtaking jewelry from ELAH, and she accompanied Valentino to the main dinner table in his honor, holding his six-foot-tall son, Luis.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, entertained the guests, and together with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit, because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived at the store in designer pants and a shirt, and at dinner, she wore a sexy long black dress, and on her night at the opera, she was so excited about Gaya Toledo at the ballet that she went over to one of the bars and made a grand plie, reminiscing about the old days.
Ines Sastre didn't attend the palace search, but before he did, he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning, we were enjoying Oliver Martinez -- he's also about six feet tall and he rides a motorcycle -- and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, bringing his own sheets and towels, and he announced in advance that he would not ask for any scent in the room.
Stars under the starry heavens of Paris.
Oh, my God, this is life.
1001, the stress-relieving number.
Not a thousand, but a thousand and one ways to disconnect from the chaotic and messy routine.
And the other good news is that we can find them all in one book, which will be coming to bookstores on September 30th, to bring peace of mind.
It's almost torturous to hear the clock ticking at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to think about the fast-paced life that the world is forcing on you every day.
The office is called tension, and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
But there are many ways to deal with daily fatigue and workplace problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classic massages, and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book to help anyone find a solution that suits their mood and is tailored to their leisure time.
The stress-relieving work is called 1001 Relaxation Methods and the calmness it brings to the bookstore comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that you cannot eliminate stress from your workplace or from your personal relationships, this guide will surely shake your faith.
In fact, it also offers other ideas that can all help you relax, like tips on getting closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it's time to sit back, relax, and just focus on reading.
♪ Who talk in their dreams ♪
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not talking about people who wake up and tell me what happened to them that day, but people who talk in their sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It's quite common, especially among children and teenagers.
I'm sure more of you have heard him talk at night.
In terms of frequency, it may be completely rhapsodic (e.g., occurs only once in a high fever illness) or more regular (e.g., once a day, weekly, or monthly), and usually the child has no memory the next day.
It cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often combined with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime wakefulness, nocturnal enuresis, or sleepwalking, but these are not legal either.
As mentioned, high fever can be a symptom of stress or a heightened state of arousal.
Well, it's been little studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, consist of disjointed words, murmuring, but it can also be in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the condition is very severe, it is advisable to monitor the child and seek professional help, which can identify the underlying cause of the problem and provide a solution.
As mentioned earlier, it is a benign condition, and therefore there is no cure unless accompanied by some other manageable form of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or stress).
But there are a few things you can do, and here's a bunch of prevention measures:
Make sure the child stays calm before bed.
Choose toys that are soothing and avoid TV shows or series that are more intimidating or aggressive.
Children who are prone to nervousness or have difficulty relaxing are taught some relaxation techniques to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child sleep more soundly.
If he does start talking in his sleep, we try to stay calm.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful Advice
Don't wake the child.
It would be superfluous, because the child is unconscious, but it would wake him up.
Even though he talks, he's actually sleeping and resting.
Remember, if the child is experiencing repeated severe anxiety, it is recommended that you consult a professional or find out what is causing the child's high levels of anxiety.
If he speaks intelligibly (which is rare), do not start asking questions to get anything out of him.
It would be unnecessary, because during sleep, he's not conscious enough to concentrate.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful about interpreting what you hear and what conclusions you draw.
Never tell a child that they can be interrogated at night about their secrets.
I'm not even kidding about it.
It caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is that you don't worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally straight to the Illhaeusern
After a long low-flying, Illhaeusern's team finally got a new boost and won again at home.
Although it was not a close game, the yellow and black were in a position to take advantage of one of them and eventually win.
The pace of the match was not very tight, as the attackers were having trouble finding the right rhythm.
The first shot to the goal was attempted by the guest captain Kauffmann, but the away ball just touched the top of the goalpost. Illhaeusern then took the lead and the shots followed one after another: Fonderflick attempted a long shot, then Hirn's shot went over the goal, while Romain spiccel and Diebold also attempted a long shot to shake Dannemarie's defence.
On the other side, the players were crammed into a block to defend the midfield, and only the perpetual motion Riahi was in the shot.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale were positioned first on Dannemarie's side, and the first goal was scored immediately after Diebold's first shot.
However, the Illhausern goal scorer did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight at a loss.
Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble to the home team, who just pulled back a little to strengthen their defence.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration by fishermen paralysed traffic in several ports in Brittany and Normandy, so the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with the representatives of the protesters.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit coincides with the meeting of the 'crisis committee' set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in gas oil prices, which have surpassed the record average price of €1.14 per litre.
According to David Martinon, spokesman for the President of the Republic, the President will "discuss with fishermen how to help companies regain their competitiveness and make sailing conditions and wages safer".
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, demonstrations were held in the provinces of Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost 10 km.
Traffic at Quiberon's marina was also shut down, but the roads to Belle-Île were not closed.
They've set up roadblocks on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by setting fire to tires and pallets in front of fuel depots in the port of Brest at dawn, while demonstrations also took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other Atlantic and English ports, such as in Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where fishermen refused to board, and in Le Havre, where some 20 vessels blocked trade.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Le Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region lifted the blockade on the massive Total oil refinery in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, decided to wait for the next step at the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday.
The 'crisis committee' in Le Guilvinec is due to decide on its next step and attend a meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests represented by the heads of the national fisheries committee, as the committee has not supported their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "the fishermen are not giving in to their demands" and "they refuse to travel to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen, who pay no tax on gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents a liter, but they believe that the only way a vessel would become profitable is if the price of gas oil fell below 0.30 euros a liter.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The memorable lead actor of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" has died at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83 from cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid their respects to the late movie legend and dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the crisis threatening the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is able to keep up with the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company's president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian producer relies heavily on the Chinese market, in particular for its aircraft with a capacity of 30 to 120 seats.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in the last eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, which was bailed out by U.S. authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back $85 billion in back pay, reports the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. pension business, AIG would divest most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
According to the Times, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday night to discuss the sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets AIG is seeking to sell include its aircraft leasing business, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, the newspaper says that no final decision has yet been made on the sale.
AIG needs to quickly acquire liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, taking the risk of losing up to 80% of its capital and a corresponding proportion of its shareholders.
A study by Paris Historique on the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bank bailout plan, with the Dow Jones index down 6.98 percent (a record drop of nearly 800 points), and the Nasdaq down 9.14 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined 777.68 points to close at 10 365.45.
The biggest drop in the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, which is based mainly on technology securities, closed down by 199,61 points to 1 983,73 points, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 enlarged index decreased by 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points according to official closing data.
Wall Street was already in trouble at the opening, but when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bank bailout to restore market equilibrium, it went into a deep slump.
The House of Representatives voted 228 to 205 to reject the funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
The plan was rejected by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
"This has filtered out bad signals as Congress seems unable to approve a plan", says FTN Financial analyst Lindsey Piegza.
"It also shows how much the market was expecting this plan", he added, expressing concern that if such a plan was adopted a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really doomed . . . , the Fed and other central banks will have to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will tighten further", warns Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To add to the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "Financial institutions are going bankrupt every day" in the United States.
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking business was bought by its rival, Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe has accelerated abruptly, necessitating emergency bailouts of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland, and Germany, signaling that the market is "in a crisis not just in the United States but worldwide", adds an FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has rebounded significantly.
The yield on the 10-year government bond fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening, while the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% to 4.161% the day before.
Obama wins first televised debate
The first debate between the two US presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would emerge as the winner of the duel.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign officials claimed victory in a televised duel that was watched by a third of American households.
Political analyst David Gergen says that while John McCain's performance was respectable, it was not "impressive" enough to stop his popularity from declining, as polls showed five weeks before the presidential election.
According to Gallup, the Democratic candidate is better off in the race: the results of the poll released on Saturday show Obama has a five-point lead over McCain (44% and 49%, respectively).
Among the most predictable, undecided voters, 39 percent of those polled said Obama would win, while 25 percent said McCain would, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to increase his lead with a promising performance by his running mate, Joseph Biden, as Biden prepares for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned over the weekend: "It would be wrong to underestimate Palin.
He has a good feeling".
McCain, in his 70s, never fails to highlight his own, undoubtedly vast, foreign policy experience, while also emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on the issues that were the focus of their first face-to-face meeting.
"It seems Senator Obama doesn't understand that"... the attack was repeated.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", McCain declared.
This is the main attack platform used by the Republican TV commercials that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, insisted that he was the future.
He didn't let himself be embarrassed: he was concise and precise.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't get it, Obama does", echoed a Democratic ad aired over the weekend that lashed out at the Republican leader for still not measuring the impact of the crisis on the American "street people".
"In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama told a crowd of 20,000 in North Carolina yesterday, who had gathered in torrential rain for a rally.
The financial turmoil in the world is clearly in favor of Obama, who the American people see as the best person to save an economy on the brink of collapse.
"The next seven may prove to be a turning point", said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic senator.
Congressman Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had "as excellent an instinct in economics" as Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is "the final verdict on eight years of bad economic policies created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the stock market's fluctuations, he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans, adding that his primary goals include building the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and establishing a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates have carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) bank rescue plan, which was passed by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday night to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
After polling stations closed on Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered on the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although results have not yet been released, many young people have demonstrated against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: "Mr. Dictator, resign!"
Some admit that they did not even go to vote. "Why would I go?
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has tried to make itself look good to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic regime change.
If the election is declared fair, the monitors could lift sanctions that have denied visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and frozen some bank accounts.
The opposition, however, claims that the elections were not fair.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes", lamented Yuri Potyemkin, spokesman for the United Democratic Forces coalition, which is organized by 12 parties and is thus very heterogeneous.
"The changes were only nominal", stresses Aleksandar Milinkievich, the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement.
If opposition deputies get into parliament, it means they've been appointed, not elected.
But getting into parliament allows them to get on television, sit in the regions of the country and introduce legislation.
The opposition must therefore be involved in political life, because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our heavily indebted economy to Russia goes into crisis and we are unable to recover, we risk falling under Russian jurisdiction.
We want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the vote as valid.
They stress that the turnout seems to be too high and that the large-scale organisation of the early voting (in which 26% of voters in Minsk participated) has allowed for any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asks Social Democratic leader Aleksandr Kozulin, who was the second-to-last to be released from prison in August this year, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
And the opposition will have no more than five members in parliament, the ones who are most in line with the leadership.
The silence of the night is once again falling on October Square.
And on TV, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are celebrating.
Blood Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and President Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood donation companies in the world.
Most important, he has managed to regain public confidence, which was severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980's and 1990's.
As you know, the national blood supply managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service was infected with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the tragedy and the general uproar, the Canadian government launched a formal investigation in February 1994, led by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to formulate recommendations for avoiding similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever's report was delayed, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Commission fulfilled this task.
The Gélineau and Krever Reports led to the creation of two blood services in Canada: Héma-Québec, which serves Québec, and the Canadian Blood Services, which serves all other provinces and territories.
"When Héma-Québec began operations in 1998, only 38 percent of people had confidence in the Quebec blood supply system", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the years since, however, we have been able to regain public confidence by improving the safety of blood products and by working in the field". Décary proudly reports that by early 2008, almost 94% of Quebecers had trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle since its establishment on 28 September 1998.
During this period, a number of cases of the new strain of the disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were detected in Europe, infecting humans, says the doctor, who has been running the company since it was founded in 1998.
"We had no idea that this disease was transmitted through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the key recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which was that if we are unsure and there is a risk of serious disease, we should take exclusionary measures, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain damage and inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was established beyond a doubt that the disease is also transmitted through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle".
In 1999, a technique that allows for a more precise diagnosis of HIV was introduced, the nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus itself in the blood of donors rather than the antibodies produced against the virus, on which previous tests were based.
"The NAT test has shortened the window from infection to detection of the virus in the blood with our technical tools", he explains.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This significantly reduced the risk of unknowingly contaminating the blood supply and preventing detection.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of AIDS being spread by blood transfusion.
The risk of someone getting infected with HIV in blood today is 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we would have to distribute 12 million blood products while someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for one such case to occur and for someone to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
"I think that today anyone can freely accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health", says Héma-Québec's number one executive.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen will enter the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, where it is transmitted through insect bites, similar to the West Nile virus.
Therefore, we must be on the alert at all times", continued Dr Décary, stressing that in addition to emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"As the population ages, so do the needs.
As cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the blood supply, as only 3% of the population of Quebec is eligible to donate blood.
However, any healthy person who is at least 18 years of age and who meets the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of applicants will not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have been in a country where malaria is rampant are not eligible to donate blood for a year.
"With this 3 percent, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to run out of supplies.
But we have to increase the number of donors as the existing ones get older, because they can't donate blood after a while.
But it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but even more difficult to keep them and to get them to become regular blood donors.
In today's fast-paced world, you have barely an hour to go and donate blood". - Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeball tissue, and skin tissue, used almost exclusively in cases of severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, transformed and frozen and then placed at Héma-Québec, which also manages Québec's only public stem cell bank.
Once treated as medical waste, cord blood can be harvested to produce blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the arrival of our 1,000th cord blood sample in our bank a few weeks ago, and we plan to take more than 1,000 new samples each year.
We will probably start offering them for transplantation early next year", said Dr. Décary, who says that the cord blood program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are sad that they cannot afford it" - indeed, Héma-Québec is unable to make this complex and expensive programme available in all hospitals in Québec.
Football - Impact in the quarterfinals
The Montreal Impact defeated the Seattle Sounders 3-1 in the USL-1 Semifinals yesterday, and advanced to the quarterfinals with a 4-3 overall record.
The decisive goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half went goalless, in the second half the Montreal team's two centre-backs, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found their way into the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque is the only Sounders player to pass goalie Matt Jordan.
Recall that in their first game on Friday, the Impact were defeated 2-1 by the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact are playing the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder, who lost 3-1 to the Whitecaps in Game 1, won 4-3, but still the Whitecaps went into the playoffs with a 5-4 overall record.
Impact is scheduled to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the games are still being worked out today.
In the shell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite trio is ready for another season.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the way with three great attacks, and finally the Canadiens beat the Florida Panthers 3-2 on penalties last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two and Kovalev scored a goal, which was the team's fourth victory in six preliminary matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shoot-out.
"I'm not ready yet", warns the Russian player.
"I need one more match to feel really fit".
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third", Guy Carbonneau noted.
"But I think he was happy with the outcome of the game.
He got a huge standing ovation".
Charest's Northern Aspirations
The Prime Minister has not ruled out the possibility of elections this year.
Just after the Liberal Party convention, Jean Charest left yesterday for Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is poised to win the midterm elections.
'Pushing back our last great northern border': this ambitious long-term goal was articulated by Jean Charest at the Quebec Liberal Party meeting in Lévis yesterday.
During his lecture, behind his back, a series of images like "Moulin à images" were shown.
The three giant projectors were followed by impressive images: hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
These spectacular devices are used during election times.
The Prime Minister, however, refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his timetable was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" for the future of Quebec, which is embodied in a "new economic area": a labour agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement and several agreements with Ontario.
Recently, the opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at 49° north) has often been a topic of the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
The President, however, merely explained why he considered the North "a treasure-mine of enormous potential", but he did not mention the time factor, the amount of investment or the specific order of priority for future projects.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities: in particular, hydroelectric power, forestry and, in particular, mining, which are further boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
In the north, he said, are found "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds".
This territory, which is "twice the size of France", is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only in us, but in us", the head of state repeated, stressing that he wants to create a national founding myth.
He stressed that Quebec's development was largely determined by its links with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec's planning work, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added after taking a stage break to look at the huge map behind him.
"The north, which covers 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed", the premier said at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, which has been reaffirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm this same resolution on behalf of the Government", he said.
On the other hand, "we must rethink our approach to the North in the face of climate change", the prime minister said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which is opened each year by melting polar ice.
In the new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
What about the native people of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister stated that the Quebec government is paying special attention to them and that the plan will benefit them greatly, especially the young.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a youth deputy for the Parti Québécois), have already started consultations with some 30 local communities.
An inter-ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role, has also started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "a common vision is created".
The development of the North would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan is coordinated, systematic and environmentally friendly", the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the vision of the Liberal prime ministers before him.
"Like the liberals before us, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began with a large cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party leader on Friday.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that Beauharnois be renamed Adélard-Godbout dam.
"Our party politicians, including Godbout, founder of Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who led the quiet revolution and spread hydroelectric power across the country, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also cited another - true conservative - work, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, President Charest stressed that it was planned to be commissioned in 2012.
"That's between us, but I plan to be there", he told his followers, and his statement was met with loud applause.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote in the autumn of this year, which the law allows.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was already full, as he had taken on tasks at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party congress at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal president to explain the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without thinking, mainly on "constitutional aspirations": the Liberal Party specifically demands that "the specific character of Quebec" be recognized in the Constitution.
I also want Quebec to be able to appoint the members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council, and these members should have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, however, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, has re-introduced the Northern Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the Liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to implement this policy.
If they had not done so, 'we would have gone a lot further today' said Ms Marois, in agreement with Ms Mercure, who was nominated by the Jean-Talon vote today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"We would like to see this not be a mere show", said Sébastien Proulx, the party leader who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from prison today.
Letters - A Country in Disfavor
Vic Toews, a Harper cabinet minister (now "justice" minister) took the liberty of calling Louise Arbourt Canada's "shame" last summer.
To insult a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and deserves all our admiration in this way says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about you, Stephen Harper.
So this is our government, the only Western country that didn't bring home its own citizens from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is a government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager when he committed the crimes he was accused of.
This is the only government that, despite Canada being a signatory to the Geneva Convention, has broken its word and allowed a child soldier to be slaughtered in inhuman conditions.
The only government that makes a puppet show of justice while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let's just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are all calling for Omar Khadr to be returned to Canada to face a fair trial.
And our government turns a blind eye to torture, not caring that a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually, and that years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we may not be aware of it now, we are witnessing the insidious destruction of our rights, our freedom and our democracy.
So the time has come when there is no morality: any Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily beaten, tortured and imprisoned at the whim of a government leader who has been a minority until now (and what will happen after October 14...?).
Many voters believe that they can find salvation in a party that glorifies virtue, law and order, but they fail to see that this government tramples on the values that have given our country its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, you'd rather look for this than shame.
The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, there was a letter from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president and CEO of Barrick Gold in Canada.
In response to Orwell's argument, Garver states that the world's largest gold mining company has filed a six million dollar libel suit against three authors and a small-cap publishing company to initiate what he calls a "public debate".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decisions - especially in defamation cases - are based, not on truth, but on law.
It's no surprise that Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to destroy anyone who disagrees with their position?
Regardless of the outcome of the case, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada must spend considerable sums of money to defend and fight an unequal battle with an army of lawyers on the other side, supported by the almost inexhaustible resources of the mining industry.
In such an unequal fight, tactics often include subverting the defendant and striking a friendly agreement, not only to silence the opposing side but also to intimidate those who try to reopen the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they should have put their views out there.
Although this is different in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada the parties to the dispute generally do not hit each other with sticks but express their thoughts.
The mine would have simply opened its books and files and prepared for a real debate in the press, in the media, in publications, paying independent research groups to shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public and in one move, it's sweeping away petitions and letters written in defense of the authors of Noir Canada.
Mr. Garver, perhaps you could explain how you can initiate a "public" debate if you ignore the opinion of this public?
In the vice president's mind, the word probably refers only to the badly paid lawyers, not to the entire population of Canada.
In a democratic state, even those who insult others have the right to free speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the main reason why the public supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is because they condemn the mining company's harsh practices.
The public is willing to hear Barrick and pass judgment, but they would do so on the basis of civilized reasoning, rather than a lawsuit that many would rather have silenced. (Incidentally, Barrick Gold recently wrote to the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using the term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal arguments, the Barrick Gold trial is an open attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, which are the building blocks of every democratic society.
The whole procedure denies the right to cite credible sources, to debate facts and their interpretation, which are the basis of intellectual activity.
If a country like Canada can study and discuss subjects that are not appealing to the wealthy corporations of today's world, who will have the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it should do so according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada apply.
You have the right to answer.
In our academic circle, we've been able to handle arguments, disagreements and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's reckless behavior clearly shows that contrary to what it claims, it has no desire to engage in open debate.
This is a loss for both the academic world and the Canadian public debate institution, and it is time for governments to finally put in place measures that limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
The Wall Street bailout is a deal between Democrats and Republicans.
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on an economic bailout, the largest such plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to stem the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public funds allocated; new provisions to keep the number of houses occupied due to late payment at a level; access to the salaries of managers of companies receiving aid.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Judd Gregg, the Republican congressman who was in the hearing yesterday, announced the good news just minutes before midnight after a two-day marathon hearing.
"We have made great progress toward a solution that will work effectively in markets", declared Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush administration.
"Everything we did was to save the real economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, there will be a huge shock, chaos and disruption in the daily lives of Americans", said Rep. Judd Gregg, R-N.C.
The hearing has been accelerated in the last few hours over fears that another failure could have a detrimental impact on investor sentiment.
They gave you a deadline to make a deal until the stock market opens this morning.
Two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, but expressed displeasure that the situation had escalated to extremes.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with expanding the agreement with provisions such as the retention of homeownership or the pay of state-assisted corporate executives.
"When we ask the taxpayer to take some extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibility of other people, it is not a very welcome thing.
But these steps are necessary", he noted on a U.S. television program.
When asked by another network if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, "I'd like to know the details, but I hope so".
"From what I have read in broad outline, it is clear that this is something that we all have to digest and move on from.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan would use taxpayer money to buy the dubious claims of American financial institutions, their somewhat risky, unsellable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then spread to other debt-backed (commercial) securities, and finally led to the freezing of liquidity and the insolvency of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft of the agreement was defeated by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems we've gotten out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to let the government provide certain "toxic" assets to struggling companies rather than buy them.
To satisfy all members of Congress, the plan included a provision that if the government had to bear losses under the program for five years, it could impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion installment would be paid first, followed by another $100 billion if the president sees fit.
The remaining $350 billion would have to be approved by Congress in another vote.
In return for the aid, Washington will acquire shares in the companies it helps, which will give it a dividend on the profits, which it can sell after the crisis has passed.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the seizure of the property used as collateral for the mortgage loans covered by the plan and to set the maximum amount of salary and severance pay for the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The plan's developers want the House to vote on it today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still uncertain whether the plan will be approved.
Because there were repeated statements against the plan yesterday from both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is clear that Washington does not hear your voice", Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But none that would benefit the taxpayers".
Brad Sherman, the Democratic congressman who leads a small congressional group called the "skeptic faction", presents things differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred leading economists, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us asking Congress to take its time and consider carefully which path to take", Sherman said yesterday.
Europe, at the same moment, understood once again that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis conference, the three Benelux countries announced that they were going to nationalise a part of the Fortis banking group worth EUR 11,2 billion (USD 16,3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments was necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not acquire its bankrupt competitor after losing EUR 2 million (USD 2,9 billion) in the secondary mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis, with 85,000 employees, is one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
"This is not money wasted", Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get voting rights and influence at the bank.
This is precisely what depositors and households value now that the situation is looking uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the English Channel, the British government appears to be preparing to nationalize another bank that has been squeezed by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of the outstanding loans of Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which the real estate loans amount to £41 billion (US$75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will acquire the British bank's subsidiaries and client base.
Bradford and Bringley would thus be the second bank to be nationalised by the UK Government since the start of the crisis, after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to his acting idol
His beautiful blue eyes were considered by some to be his greatest batting card, others his greatest weakness.
Did the charming American actor ever get rid of his narcissistic mirror?
Yes, and no.
His shyness, his sensitivity and his innate talent also kept him from the blunt style that the real great monsters of the art world have.
What a huge field he's running in.
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at age 83 on Friday at his Connecticut estate, one of the last icons of the American film boom.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who he resembled and long considered his rival on the screen, more restrained and certainly more vulnerable in his roles, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Blood-mixing often results in extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots have contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of the American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which only enhanced his merits.
He embodied the ideals of a self-made man and a nation devoted to the ideal of a war-torn warrior in the Pacific, and he studied drama at Yale University in the early 1950s, then at the Actor's Studio in New York before exploding into theater, television and, soon after, film.
In addition to being a leading civil rights activist, he was a race car driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and was considered a sex symbol, despite being happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we'll never know what shadows were cast in the life of this mysterious, reclusive, dedicated actor who hated the glitter of show business.
He was an honest man in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week has shocked movie buffs: his big roles are now only seen on the black screen of memory.
A look back at his life's work, the seventh American art, cinema has been in continuous flux for over 50 years.
Our memories are intertwined with the charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the young man who is cold to his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), who was seen in the 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof".
Most recently, in 1990, he was portrayed as the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who in his old age, is faced with the fact that his marriage has not lived up to his expectations.
We've seen a lot of other faces in Paul Newman's films.
His memorable performance as Rocky Graziano, the violent criminal boxer in Robert Wise's film Someone Up There, a role originally intended for James Dean and taken over after his death, launched Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant production of "The Great Trouble", which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
He played a bitter, vindictive billiard player in Robert Rossen's brilliant 1961 film The Swindler, and returned to the same role in Martin Scorsese's 1987 film The Color of Money, for which he received his only Academy Award nomination out of nine.
Times changed, but always the same face: this was him.
He's always been like this.
His career was marked by a change of eras.
Younger audiences are most familiar with George Roy Hill's cult film "Icebreakers" (1977), in which he plays Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of a hockey team.
Fans of the Coen brothers' "The Big Leap" were able to see it in 1994.
The series was capped off by Sam Mendes' 2003 film Road to Perdition, in which he last appeared as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively early, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, though he denounced Hollywood with its glitz, glitz and hypocrisy.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it "a living repudiation of underplay" and felt that his acting was too strong.
But the profession was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time was a film character.
Yet he rarely played young and successful characters, but rather characters on the fringes of society - nervous, alcoholic, malicious or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he could reproduce with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: deep down, a truly shy and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (an adaptation of the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), he and his wife, Joanne Woodward, portrayed a melancholy woman.
And in 1984, he made a film called "Harry and Son", a film of restraint and sadness, in memory of his son Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's many admirers remembered the actor, and his close friend and longtime comrade, Robert Redford (with whom he co-starred in "The Big Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said with sadness:
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret to the vibrant personality of this great actor we have just lost.
His legendary career is overshadowed by his fight for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking and his criticism of Hollywood's excesses.
We've seen her smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods many times, and she did it with a pretty bad mouth, even though she thought it was funny at first.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always donated to a foundation for sick children.
Newman never sat on his hands and knees, he was committed to his profession.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father was always and forever incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege to be here".
It is a privilege to have been a part of the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at the Zuschlag & Tsai accounting plant?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of the criminal case against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of committing fraud and other crimes, including forgery, in a criminal organisation, which caused particularly significant damage.
The prosecutor's office said that the money from the competition was used for their own purposes and that the tasks were often justified by false accounts.
The state and local government funds - totalling about HUF 65 million - went partly into the cash register of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of certain individuals.
The methodology also described by the Authority was that the bidding money was drawn on the basis of cost accounts which had no real performance behind them and the associations never fulfilled their commitment.
The indictment says most of the receipts were fake.
The stamps were obtained from the market in Józsefváros and the stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas.
And the companies in whose name the invoices were produced, among others, were on the Balaton-Rural Tour, to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter said he had to look for boarding houses and restaurants.
He requested a bill for his consumption there, which was then used to prepare invoices for applications to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Social and Labour Treasury and the Metropolitan Municipality.
Most of these were written by István Lados and his partner, András Őri, who according to our information wrote most of the reports needed to obtain the subsidies.
One of the targets of Lados' "learning journey" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlages in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 members of the Sigur Point Association.
However, the manager claims that the restaurant would not have been able to accommodate so many people at once.
Similarly, the bill for the Foundation for a Better Future - later called Together for the Third Millennium - issued in the summer of 2002 was riddled with formal and substantive errors.
A boarding house in Badacsonytoma had only three rooms, no more than ten people could sleep in it a night, yet the bill was for 130 guests.
But the imaginative form-fillers also went too far when they marked Pigal Kft., also a catering company, whose accounts - according to the information provided to the prosecution - did not even contain documents for Better Future and Hoppá.
The company's CEO, Wolf Winner, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp".
He added that, for reasons other than form, it was also not correct that the bill accommodated 100 people, since they had a total of 11 rooms that did not have that many seats.
Plus, the bill was for catering, even though their restaurant's been out of business for a while.
The eager account holders did not even check that the Budapest travel agency they visited only organised foreign trips, so they marked a botched trip to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not comply with the company's accounting practice.
Moreover, as the investigation showed, VAT was also included in the document, whereas the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt.
Among other things, the VAT rate was incorrect in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Better Future, as the company's services are charged not the 25 percent VAT but the 15 percent VAT, and the hotel's employees only issued a machine invoice, while the invoice was handmade.
Moreover, the 'exhibitors' also undermined the account by identifying road haulage as an activity carried out by a company, as revealed by the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company which was originally based on investment advice.
In addition, due to formal differences - incorrect invoice format, not a real stamp - the invoices for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Safe Point were found to be fake.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehertot Sportkamp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the bills.
The counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. in Nyerere was being liquidated at the time (2001) when the Young Town Association group dined there, which is why the company's liquidation officer, to our knowledge, denied that he had issued the paper.
They deliberately put it out
The other group of account issuers is made up of those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious account.
The Foundation for Budapest Opportunity has issued a bill for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, for about four million forints.
The head of Collab Kft. was, according to the indictment, coerced by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious account.
It also cooperated with the Zuschlages with the now-liquidated Biogate Ltd., which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Pine Association with accounts worth approximately HUF 5 million, which were not backed by any real economic activity.
No money was moving because the bills were being written down, but the organizations had forgotten to include that in their records.
The next group of companies to issue the invoice are those that are linked to the defendants.
Thus, the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trio Ltd., a Budapest-based but not located fuel and vehicle trading company, was entrusted with the delivery of Ivan Kubatov.
The company also issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalasi, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
This company was run by a Romanian man to whom Ivan Kubatov had also passed on documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlas, Hopa and the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, and that he accepted their consideration.
Specifically, at the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment Ltd.
However, none of the companies actually operated, which the defendant claimed was because they were not employed.
However, the companies benefited from the fact that, at the request of his co-defendant, Szente Zsolt, a lawyer who also prepared the company registration documents, he issued invoices on their behalf to the associations linked to Zuschlag, Atlas and Y-Generation.
In total, Kubatov provided 15 accounts to the entities on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a total amount of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10 percent of the amounts on the accounts and the VAT hit Kubatov's mark.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were manufactured for the Safe Point bid.
Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted a bid to the socialist party's public benefit organization, the Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA) in January 2006.
They won 500-500 thousand forints, but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found during a search of Árpád's office in Kemecsei, near the education treasury.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecution, will probably report on the billing process.
The most interesting thing is that you, the prime suspect, John Zuschlag, decide to lift the veil.
His confession so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell us everything, he has not done so.
The question is whether he is in favor of this, or whether the socialists have made a deal with him in return for the compensation of the majority of the damage, 50 million forints, and Zusi takes the blame.
Who, by the way, may have been offended by the fact that his requests for relief of his detention, i.e., house arrest, have been consistently ignored.
While perpetrators of far more damaging and irreparable economic crimes are free to walk or at least to wait in their own homes for the end of their trial, he has no choice.
The psychology of over-bidding: Why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neuroeconomic basis for this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been uncovered by researchers at New York University's School of Neuroscience and Economics.
According to their study published in the journal Science, people do not want to be left behind in a type of competition, such as an eBay auction, so they are more likely to pay too high a price.
The research attempted to map out the neural patterns of this "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in a player auction, and the subjects' active brain areas were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Both games offered winners money, but in the auction game, where the key element is to outbid the other party, a complex called the striatum, located under the cerebral cortex, becomes activated when the game is lost.
This area of the brain plays a role in the nervous system's "self-reward" mechanism, among other functions.
The researchers therefore believe that the price increase is due to the avoidance of a severe striatum reaction.
To support their theory, the economists in the research team also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this case, three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they took their bets.
Another group was also promised an additional $15 in prize money if they won the game.
The third group received $15 just before the auction, but the other group lost that money if they lost the auction.
The only difference between the two groups was that one group was emphasized for winning and the other group for losing.
However, proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "losing" team were willing to bet higher than the control and "winning" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have hitherto only explained the phenomena of the auction by the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging techniques have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, and now we have a third explanation", notes Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's Graduate School of Business.
Hepatitis: When should you see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people are infected with chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is listed as a leading cause of death in Hungary.
There are 100,000 people in your country with hepatitis, but only 7,000 are being treated, and that's because patients often don't know they're infected.
Hepatitis is a collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
They have many similar symptoms, including hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E through the food chain (e.g. through contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (venom, vaginal discharge, saliva).
Travellers should be given a vaccine against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine for C.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after eating infected food, usually accompanied by malaise, weakness, stomach upset, and nausea.
These can cause yellowing of the skin and eye, light stools, dark urine, and may take two to three weeks to heal.
A million people die each year worldwide from the more serious form of the disease, hepatitis B-related liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that only about one in ten infected people receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, even liver cancer.
Most people infected are unaware of their disease because the pathogen is secretly destroying liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20 or 30 years later.
So then it's very important to do early prevention, to do regular screening.
Three groups have higher rates of this disease than average: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattoo users.
Worldwide, the number of people currently infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory tests, it is wise to consult a doctor if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Early detection can cure the disease, eliminate the virus from the body, and prevent infection and cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first observed in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
It aims to raise awareness of viral hepatitis, its causes and the importance of early detection.
Does it hurt less to believe in God?
A recent study found that religious faith acts as a pain reliever that may have helped Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to examine how belief in God affects people's perception of pain, reports the British Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists were given electric shocks while they were all studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study is the first in a series of studies involving academics as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from across the university.
The test was done exactly by attaching a spark plug to the left hand of the subject, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants to look intently at two paintings, the Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the Madonna and Hermes by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary's appearance would create a religious mood among the faithful, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the others and was thought to be soothing.
The subjects spent 30 minutes in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four successive sessions, while looking at either the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics reported feeling "safe" during the visit of the Virgin Mary, as being "cared for" and "calmed down, filled with peace".
They reported 12 percent less pain when viewing the religious painting than when viewing Leonardo's work.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who was involved in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even with atheists, if you just find the right one.
"We should find an image that they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father", the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, the Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases does change our personality", Wright added.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber were to show a picture of the Madonna to the faithful, what effect would it have on their pain management?
Would a quality Virgin Mary visit have even better results?
You are what you share about yourself.
On its tenth birthday, Google can tell you that people have at least as much in their pockets as they have in the sky above their heads; it knows where they've been on vacation, what kind of jobs they've been on, what they're interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's key people.
But as for the skeptics who draw parallels with Orwellian nightmares, they're missing the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about its users, which is necessary to keep up with the original goal of the founders of Google, which was to "get all the information in the world".
The Google CEO said that after 10 years of disruptive work, the company is still at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I be doing tomorrow?" or "What kind of job would I really be doing?" - but until then, software can't answer these seemingly simple questions because it doesn't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search terms are recorded precisely, from which IP address they were searched and to which page they were sent after the search.
Personalized Search, which was launched two years ago, will allow users to store their own browsing history, look back at what they've searched for, what they've clicked on, and in the long run, generate more personalized results for them - the same logic that will be used in Recommendations, which is how the system recommends products and services to us based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me, if they look at what I do?
In most cases, it is the extent of the potential power that the company represents that is scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power that triggers the backlash among netizens.
However, it is a fact that all search terms are not only recorded but can also be passed on to third parties if justified, and nothing protects the privacy rights of internet users in such legal cases.
Perhaps the most prominent example of this in recent times was the coordinated campaign against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with identifiable information about pedophiles from the social networking site it maintains called Orkut.
However, privacy-conscious netizens were able to appeal in May when the company, along with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully argued in court against the FBI that Google could no longer be forced by any provision of the Constitution to secretly serve any information requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought off some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, which it had won by invoking the strengthening of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but failed to obtain individual user search lists or a complete two-month list of websites and keywords.)
So Google's view is quite controversial: it's being whipped by people who are afraid to give their personal information because they feel their privacy and privacy is being violated by using Google services and are rebelling against the conservative-looking corporations.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its drive to bring together enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users in many countries sees them as the next generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft, which is poised to conquer the world with Windows, even though they are both fighting for the same goal.
This may be because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask users for an identification code, does not charge for its applications, and the open, free, continuously updated source code and software package is much more accessible, younger, cooler than the practice of the official software giant.
But it could also be because geeks are so keenly aware of the problematic relationship between privacy rights and the Internet, which has been one of the most talked about keywords of recent years, Web 2.0.
Because Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving a trail and using the channels of communication that we have at our disposal, and while the scale of those varies from person to person, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
The average teenager can maintain a profile on multiple social networks, from Facebook to Xangai, link to other services like Twitter or last.fm, which lists their music habits, link them to tracking systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and blog automatically with their latest photos from Flickr or Pica.
While there are many examples of this to be seen, the girlfriend easily discovers who her cheating boyfriend spent the evening with by seeing a morning stream of photos from their mutual friendship, or fires a company employee simply because he writes his honest opinion on top management in his blog, a definite notion of privacy has been completely re-evaluated.
The online life is what you show, and that's the basic principle behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid Google's monopoly, can do so (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google's search engine but also intentionally leaves no trace).
For example, many people will not register for social networking sites on purpose to avoid being found, and Google's online apps, from text editor to image manager to news reader, can be replaced with alternatives that are not tied to huge server fleets and that don't build the best profile of you ever.
The public is not so much waiting in secret for Google to show off their tooth whites.
With a current valuation of $156 billion, more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising interfaces threaten advertising agency revenues, and the rapidly accelerating introduction of services is a major headache not only for Microsoft but for many other software developers.
Critical observers find these to be disconcertingly contradictory: for example, top management completely rejected employees' objections after doubling the company's nursery fees, management found it too expensive to feed employees multiple meals a day, but all this is dwarfed by the fact that Google submitted to the Chinese government in 2006 and, under their agreement, the company filters out any hits that violate good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal policies is that they don't pre-announce a new service until it's ready to go, but it's clear that the problems that are coming in the coming months and years could move the world to another point: while some people think that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project has grown to the point where the company will soon be facing the U.S. Supreme Court, others are terrified of the health system, where we can build a complete health profile of ourselves with our previous findings, our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database could also be a good starting point for the next generation of science fiction writers, as Cory Doctorow's popular novel, Scroogled, describes in Orwellian tones a future in which a human being can only be approached with alarmingly good Google data.
Two teenagers helped the Oz double killer track down
Police have questioned two teenagers in the case of the Ozd's double murder, with a well-founded suspicion that they helped cover up the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Department said Tuesday.
The youths have confessed to the crime and are currently being charged with conspiracy.
The two juveniles - two girls, according to MTI - are in custody.
Contributing to the crime is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in Ozdi's double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
You're charged with premeditated, profiteering, multiple homicide.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor to a remote settlement last Wednesday, where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man prepared the crime in advance, which is also indicated by the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to acquire the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion CZK - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from the list of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
The Polish State holds 99% of the shares and intends to sell more than 60% of the securities within a few months.
The Czech business daily E15 has learned that the Polish offer represents the highest amount ever offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, bids have been submitted so far by the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among the interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the Prague Stock Exchange's demise in the future.
The Prague Stock Exchange is valued at 5 to 10 billion crowns by market experts.
The shareholders' agreement would see about 90 percent of the shares sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of around 25%, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis as seen by European newspapers
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers already mention "September 11th".
The global financial crisis is the result of the US president, allegedly, the president has not even been able to list his own party behind the rapidly assembled bill to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been talking about, it's more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Some of the Madrid press sees Washington as the mastermind.
El Mundo believes that the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the American financial system collapsing is growing, and the whole world will suffer.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, the congressional vote threatens to leave Washington with no political means to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Some governments can still bail out bankrupt financial institutions with taxpayer money.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither cash nor further impulses will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national selfishness and centralize control over the fragmented financial markets.
More than 100 billion euros were handed to ailing financial institutions on Monday alone, recalls Der Standard, a Vienna newspaper, which says that there are growing fears that European taxpayers, like the Americans, will have to dig deep to fix the crisis.
The EU has not so far taken seriously the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to flaunt hundreds of billions of euros, but they should be able to record: in which case it is reasonable to use taxpayers' money to prevent further damage.
The intelligent car mimics the flight of the dongo
What better way to develop technologies to avoid collisions than by mimicking the obstacle sensors found in nature?
Like the bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the dongos gave Nissan engineers a strategic starting point for how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C bioreliable robotic steering system, a robotic mini-car endowed with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that eliminates all collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety cover", explained Kazuhhiro Doi, technology PR and research and development brand manager at the exhibition.
It is important for the bee's complex eye, which can see in all directions at more than 300 degrees.
To mimic the complex eye's function, engineers have taken up the idea of a laser rangefinder.
This, in a 180-degree field of view in front of BR23C, identifies obstacles within 2 meters, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately converts to collision avoidance.
Within a fraction of a second, the obstruction is detected, and the robot mimics the bee's movements and immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this evasive maneuver is completely instinctive.
"If it weren't, the car robot wouldn't be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shields, a layer within which collisions are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process has to mirror what one bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process must be completed in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot be upward, downward or transversely, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
So instead of the endless possibilities for bees to avoid other bees, here, only rotational motion and acceleration and deceleration were used as the options available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh says that the instinctive intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, much less store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
It doesn't need to store them and responds with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory at a time.
You don't need gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step towards developing the instantaneous avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could be incorporated into mass-produced cars within ten years.
A further application could be to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to the given destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He even named his precious child
A written version of the $700 billion bailout law to buy up bad loans from banks is in the works.
First round, they spend half the money.
In a series of new talks that lasted until Saturday after midnight, congressional leaders reached a consensus on a $700 billion bailout, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the deal was only a matter of putting it on paper.
The compromise package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the compromise, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be done.
The written version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened at 8pm (Washington time) on Sunday (or 2am (Central European time) on Monday), but did not cause a spectacular upturn on the stock market.
The bill to amend the program, known as the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008, will be voted on Monday by the House of Representatives and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, by the way, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was to spend $700 billion on buying low-quality, credit-deficient securities one at a time.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent by using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes on the bill, which is expected to be on Monday, from which the Treasury buys bad credit-backed, bad-rated securities, with the fate of another $100 billion at the discretion of the president.
The program will be overseen by a special committee, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion is up to Congress.
The law allows the Ministry of Finance to use a combination of tactics: to buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, and other types of 'toxic' loans simultaneously.
The purchase can be done directly through auctions, the ministry said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial institution guarantees the assets of concern, for which the companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said the bill would provide the necessary tools to provide up to $700 billion to address the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it be the widespread purchase and insurance of bad assets or the avoidance of systemic risk from the collapse of a major financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
But the heads of troubled banks waiting for state bailouts can expect their exit funds - simply called a golden parachute in overseas slang - to be limited by the government.
The payment limits are only in certain cases and depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the department buys it at auction, it will levy a surcharge on the gold parachute unless the levyed bank manager is retired.
When you buy bad loans outright, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the executive funds are not overstated.
The picture is that the existing golden parachute contracts remain unchanged, the restriction only applies to the new ones, to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on CEO compensation will be in place, said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
In addition, the State will acquire a shareholding in the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, who will ultimately benefit from the transaction once the economy and the rescued bank are back on their feet.
The bill calls for the president to submit a proposal to Congress within the next five years that would provide a way to reimburse taxpayers for the expected losses in the financial sector.
There were, of course, people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American people asked us to do, which is not protect taxpayer dollars", said California Republican Representative Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed the measures were instigated by the same people responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9% in August 2007 according to KSH.
Industrial export sales prices were 1,1% higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% compared to a year earlier.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0,7% higher than in the previous month and 3,2% higher than a year earlier.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only marginally, by 0.1%, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices of manufacturing also increased slightly by 0.1% compared to July.
The largest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sector (2,8%) mainly due to monthly price increases of 4,6% in bags, straps and footwear respectively.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical raw materials led to a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical manufacturing sector (1,6 per cent).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the electrical machinery and instrument production (0.9%) and, to a lesser extent, in the wood processing sector (0.1%).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we have seen price increases between 0.2% and 0.9%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which are a major component of the industry's domestic sales, increased by 0,3% in August, mainly due to the prolonged impact of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, the oil refining sector saw the largest increase in prices (32.4%) in terms of domestic sales of manufacturing sectors.
The production of metal products increased by 13,2% and the production of food, beverages and tobacco, which accounted for the majority of the production, by 11%.
The decrease in prices was recorded in the textile and clothing industry (2.5%) and in the electrical machinery and equipment industry (0.3%).
The price increase in the other manufacturing sectors ranged between 0,6% and 9,1%.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices have risen by 10.2 percent in the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors were up 18.7 per cent on the previous year.
Among the target groups of sectors in domestic sales, the sectors producing capital goods showed the largest monthly price increase (0.7%) in August.
Prices in the consumer goods sector increased by 0.3%, while prices in the energy and downstream sectors remained unchanged on the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increases were observed in the energy and downstream sectors (16,8 per cent) compared to the same month of the previous year.
We have seen a 6.8% rise in prices in consumer goods and a 1.4% decrease in prices for capital goods.
Industry export sales prices in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared with the previous month, decreasing by 3.9 percent in 12 months.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7% against the euro and by 7.1% against the dollar in one month, and it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar in August 2007.
You don't need a visa to come to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
He believes that "now everything depends on whether the electronic entry and control system is implemented in time".
He also pointed out that the new system would not include an entry permit, but that tourists would have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomatic service is holding talks in Washington today.
He meets with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will receive the Order of the Star of the Republic of Hungary and holds talks with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain's foreign policy advisers.
The bank bailout is backed by Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both major party presidential candidates, pledged their support Sunday for the government's $700 billion bank rescue package, but one politician is calling for the Treasury Secretary to resign.
After days of marathon negotiations, congressional and administration officials announced Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement in principle on a bank bailout.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to dissolve the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better equipped than their rivals to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, with the economic issues coming to the fore, Obama has again gained some leverage, melting McCain's advantage, which he gained after the Republican convention, with the nomination of Sarah Palin for vice president.
Obama at a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday expressed hope that the $700 billion package would be passed quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection measures he had supported.
"We must act now, responsibly . . . your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are threatened", he told the 35,000-strong crowd.
He didn't fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC, "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing this ... but doing nothing is simply not the way to go".
The Republican senator said the proposal included a committee to oversee the Treasury Secretary and a limit on top executives' severance pay, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House is expected to vote on the bill Monday.
A child's view of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp voters have become more self-aware - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haider family is ready to rule Austria to prevent the Red-Black coalition.
The Spiegel
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, the article "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Parents" analyzes the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
The change of era is also a problem for all Christian democracies, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was almost exactly ten years ago probable ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s that it was below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so even in the aforementioned Stoiber era.
This is because of the CSU's consistent modernization of the province, which is eating away at its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong in the pace, but it could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the voters to the CSU, secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation brings with it an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences are visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp the voters have become more self-aware, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also remarkable that in recent weeks the most distant from the CSU have been the classical civil society groups: the self-employed, industrialists, graduates and those with higher education.
CSU's approval rating has already dropped below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily "Who, with whom? the party leaders are restrained in coalition issues" deals with the confused domestic political situation that has developed after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the EPP.
The SPÖ is prohibited by the OVP from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BSE is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens are not yet willing to negotiate a coalition.
The election has been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely let us see their cards.
SPÖ chairman Werner Faymann has confirmed his intention to negotiate with the EPP.
The SPO wants to show that it is possible to work together between the two parties - in some provinces and in social partnerships.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current EPP president, as well as Chancellor.
As you put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
There's no way this is happening again.
Molterer was cautious about the red offers.
As you said, it will certainly not be fruitful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the EPP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party, the issues must necessarily be discussed within the OVP.
President Jörg Haider has once again shown an open mind.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the governmental responsibility", Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation
The European Equal Opportunities Summit, hosted by France, which holds the EU Presidency this year, opened today in Paris.
In her message to the plenary, Járóka Lívia, a member of the European People's Party from Fidesz, as one of the keynote speakers at the professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education as one of the most serious violations of rights affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their promotion.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European human rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka - according to the Fidesz MEP's press office - warned that apart from discrimination in employment, Roma are excluded from the labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary education degree and, due to the poor quality of primary education, only a small proportion of them are able to obtain higher education".
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The Commissioner also stressed that the European Union should be able to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's external relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are maintained.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; he contributes to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
'The Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education in their EU citizenship and their low-quality and segregated education must be eliminated,' stressed Járóka Lívia.
The Commissioner also stressed that the EU's efforts to combat discrimination in schools should be coordinated with the aim of ensuring that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly implemented.
'The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by the democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,' he said.
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting to mark the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities for All', aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for transition time
At the end of October, they'll decide the fate of the disbanded Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the election's dismal defeat, heads are still turning, and the Bavarian CSU summit has postponed personal issues.
Erwin Huber, the party leader, and Günther Beckstein, the governor of the province, can still remain in office.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss, will be decided at an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticised couple were not clinging to their chairs with all their strength.
This was an attempt to calm angry faction and base members who demanded personal consequences for losing their absolute majority the day after the "Bavarian tsunami".
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of his game, the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has run out of power to only 43.4 percent.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sovereign" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although the Conservatives continue to have a high profile in the southern province, which is key for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
In an early sign of the change in the party, Huber's possible successor, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, who is also the Federal Minister of Agriculture, is also part of the small team of scouts who are beginning negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters, which are organized along the right-wing values, on a possible government coalition in Munich.
It's a strange twist of fate that the list of Free Voters is filled by Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used as a coup de grâce by the Huber-Beckstein couple, and then the ambitious local politician was treated mercilessly.
CSU leadership is now focusing all their energy on stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has been working behind the scenes, will play an active role in the transition, calling September 28 the most bitter day in the political career of the former provincial governor and former CSU president.
Huber made some bitter remarks to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved a lot more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the national success of 2005, is somehow rebuilt with common forces.
Merkel, who has been hard pressed to hide her disappointment, said the loss of CSU ground would not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
The fact is that the CSU is not going to be able to cope with the crisis and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD's 18.6% result is the weakest in Bavaria since 1946.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
Not a single opposition lawmaker has entered the Belarusian parliament following Sunday's election.
Russian observers say this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) says it is due to irregularities in the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the country of 10 million has been without an opposition for decades, the opposition, known as the United Democratic Forces (UDF), had been hoping that Lukashenko, who had won a fourth term in the disputed 2006 election, would allow some opposition members to enter parliament.
The ODSH has thus withdrawn from the boycott that was considered in advance.
The opposition's expectations were that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would seek to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians are not allowed to enter due to the anti-democratic political system of Belarus, which has been credited with curbing the steadily rising price of Russian natural gas imports and contributing to the transfer of Beltransgaz, which owns the gas pipelines through the country.
He suggested that the OSCE's assessment of the election campaign was more attentive to positive developments than to shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of opposition candidates from running.
However, the OSCE's quick report on Monday already criticized the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not able to be present at the vote count.
However, the opposition says there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, which continues to refuse to recognize the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia - which forms a federal state on paper - has been considering the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Aleksandar Milinkevich told our newspaper.
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said it was desirable to keep this, despite the fact that "the authorities are afraid to allow even one opposition member into the weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning protests in the face of the results, but rather trying to get the message to the voters that economic reforms are needed.
"We have many problems with this, of course, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are blocking the distribution, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, including the elderly", Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which sees the creation of social security as its main achievement, is not considered adequate even by the most officially supported pensioners.
- The country's debt, the growth of the trade deficit, the collapse of the social security system, which "causes a grave silence", is a matter of time, Milinkevics said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebyev, head of the CIS mission, told the RIA Novosti Russian news agency that "people do not believe in words, but in deeds".
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before work hours"
In a unique way in the history of Chigi Palace, revolving doors were installed to allow workers to enter and exit.
Starting today, this new measure will be in place to screen out law enforcement officers who block and then go out for a coffee during work hours.
The new anti-theft system was unveiled today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The revolving doors", Brunetta said, "are for better and more efficient work, reducing shortages and increasing services"
"A new, more accountable and transparent era is coming.
This is the real reform", stressed Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete the furnishing of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, "the installation of the revolving gates is also symbolically important".
We did not encounter any resistance from the employees - the Secretary General confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated".
In short, no more breakfast during work hours, no more coffee and broth.
Brunetta smiles and advises, "A good cappuccino at seven in the morning can do wonders".
At the College of Administration in Rome
In a meeting held in Brussels, the minister explained that "in three months, the absence of public sector workers due to illness has decreased by 50 percent, which means that 60,000 more people are coming to work in one year".
He added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
"which, according to the minister, has had a wage dynamic twice as high as that of the private sector in the last eight to ten years and has far exceeded the rate of inflation".
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered to join the petition sponsored by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Associations to protest against the regulations of the Brunetta-type regulation.
"While the minister of public administration boasts of data supporting the reduction of disease absences, the army of 'tireless diary thieves' keeps growing", says the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hardworking civil servants from all over Italy have gathered to declare war on the illegal provisions of the decree".
The Regional Administrative Court is challenging, inter alia, the abolition of the supplementary allowance for sickness attributable to service reasons, the extension of the period of stay of sick workers at home, which means the period during which the patient can appear, and several other criteria contained in the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is paramount
In Italy, 2,500 accidents occur every day, killing 3 and permanently disabling 27.
According to the Workers' Compensation Fund, nearly 1,200 people died in work-related accidents in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death today, claiming almost twice as many victims as homicide.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is organising the Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, traditionally held on the second Sunday in October, in all the Italian provinces to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and the media to this dramatic problem.
"The alarming data reported by ANMIL, together with the tragic events of recent days, confirm that prevention is of the utmost importance in the case of accidents at work", said President Giorgio Napolitano in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Workers with Disabilities.
The head of state warmly commended the "union's unwavering commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of the interests of workers who suffer accidents, the assistance of victims' families and the promotion of public awareness".
"Tragedies of this nature, which have generated media and public interest for their scale, are a natural and genuinely shared outrage, but in reality we have to deal with dramatic, daily, recurring incidents".
Napolitano openly admits: 'We are certainly struggling with a lack of resources, and funding for education and information is crucial.
School-based initiatives aimed at providing direct education to young people on the threshold of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
We have a duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, to not let the social importance of the issue be lost sight of, and we need more effective legislation to be put into effect.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that "the seriousness of fatal accidents at work is a social issue that weighs on the conscience of all of us and requires the institutions to put an end to it as soon as possible".
"The figures for accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths from these types of accidents is still staggeringly high", said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"But we don't want this declining trend to be accompanied by a decline in attention, because that's when the greatest tragedies happen".
'We believe that we are still not doing enough to tackle this phenomenon at a general level, which could be addressed by a complex programme of action.
We believe that more stringent supervision and controls are needed - emphasised Mr Mercandelli - and more effective intervention in the field of workforce training, starting with school education.'
"More efforts are needed to inform and make the public more receptive", he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible work environment in the face of a phenomenon which is a social problem.'
Mercandelli then criticised the 'gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work' and the 'assistance trend towards which the system has been drifting in recent years'.
"The aim is to restore workers to the security provided by insurance, because the fate of accident victims cannot depend on the arbitrary and sometimes distributive measures of legislators".
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Long-term hearing damage can be caused by listening to portable players at high volume for long periods of time, such as MP3 players,
The European Commission has published a report in Brussels, citing an opinion published today by the EU's Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"Studies show that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player at high volume for more than an hour a day for five years have a permanent hearing loss", says the report.
"It is worrying that young people who use portable loudspeakers and cell phones en masse and frequently are unaware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing", said Meglena Kuneva.
'Scientific studies indicate an undeniable risk and we must act urgently,' he added.
The main task is to inform and disseminate consumer information widely.
In the light of that opinion, we should also review the control systems already in place to ensure that they function with the necessary efficiency and keep pace with the latest technologies.'
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
'The researchers confirm that we have reason to be concerned, and the European Commission is ready to examine, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, what possible measures could be put in place to protect children and young people from noise caused by portable players and similar devices,' the member of the committee concluded.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum noise level for portable music players at 100 dB, but there is growing concern about data on hearing loss from excessive use of such sound sources.
However, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise exposure, which can significantly reduce these hearing loss.
The EU Scientific Committee has stated in its opinion that users of portable players who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week have a noise exposure that exceeds the current maximum workplace noise limit.
If you listen to music for a long time in similar circumstances, you are at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects around 5 to 10% of portable device users, which could be as many as 2.5 to 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, runs through March, results in June.
This is the agenda set by the Metropolitan Government for the work of the committee "The future of the capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commissioners will draw up the Rome Guidelines.
After the final speech in March, the study and plans will be evaluated by the Assembly and the Municipal Committee, so that the Capital Strategic Plan, officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted in June.
'It is a completely independent committee, representing all political, social and cultural ideas,' emphasises Alemanno, 'and its task is to develop proposals for Rome's development plans, on which policy-makers, the Assembly and the Local Government Committee, can rely.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where big plans for Rome could be made.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be dissolved because it has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the committee on the future of the capital city of Rome, the mayor said.
To those who find the Commission's work superfluous, claiming that its opinion is not binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it will put on the table.
If the standard is right, as it was in France with the Italian Commission, which I am sure it is with Rome, its contribution will be important.
The power of politics is often dispersed in the handling of daily affairs and in the handling of urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further ahead, taking into account the long-term perspective, and plan for the longer term, and we are committed to work for the development and future of Rome".
The Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasise that 'this Commission cannot be considered a useless 'water puppet' because it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, but it is a thought-provoking initiative and aims to attract the best minds in the capital'.
According to Alemanno, 'an open and flexible strategic framework is needed to enable our city to make the leap of quality it so desperately needs, thinking in a united spirit about its future'.
The future, which the mayor of Rome emphasises will "not be limited to the current municipal framework but look much further ahead", is not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also "the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. We'll show you why.
A prominent American politician who called himself an independent wrote about this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, whose decisions destroyed the American economy and made close links (as he still does as a private citizen) with hostile Islam".
As the election approaches, attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A woman in Miami wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama brazenly believes he can win the highest public dignity in a nation that has had two governors and five senators who are black".
These attacks are actually meaningless; they are, of course, racist, but they don't answer the question of whether voters will make a good president.
In this case, too, you're listening to your emotions instead of your mind.
In the deep South, a Mississippi newspaper wrote an editorial that said, "We know who the true American patriot is voting for in the ballot box".
There's a side of the American mindset that's been hidden here until the last minute.
"Just say what you want, and we'll know where to put the twin, Obama or McCain".
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
Never before have such words been uttered, when the black candidate's success is almost certain.
Yet despite all this cleverness, the Democratic winning weapon is George Bush.
When 1,500 people were asked what the mistakes were during the Bush administration, 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was beaten to death on the way home.
4,500 soldiers died in Iraq, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
But most people still think that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
There's a huge task ahead for the man who will succeed George W.
USA: The economic collapse is already being felt by journalists, it's time for editorial cuts, and many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The Pew Research Center asked 500 American journalists how they felt about the future status and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, right now, almost every journalist is pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not clearly claim that their concerns regarding credibility had been reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They think the 2008 crisis is a failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on the newsroom, or editorial offices that produce the newspaper.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public understands it, to be reduced to a minimum, this problem must be solved, say the journalists interviewed.
Today, American journalism is characterized by a conspicuous and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives in the print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
The press has no problem seeing where the world wide web is going.
The major publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many consider the "killer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has risen to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they were voting for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the American press, there is a gap between editorial directors, or editors, and the reporters who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of leaders are confident that their reporters will share their information with others, compared with only 23 percent at the local level.
Some associate this with a secure job.
Nationally, 47 percent of executives fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, that's 30 percent.
In America, the issue of "safe work" at the team level is always on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In a large nation like the United States of 300 million people, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV, and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it is a "should or must not" thing.
Editors are usually well paid, and editors can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month, in addition to their pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: x days in the first year, x days in the third, until after a certain time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It all depends on the climate.

Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, has rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, a real estate agent, who wanted to move from his home in Grottaferrata to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the Unipol-BNL share swap agreement.
Last week, in the course of the proceedings against him, his house arrest was lifted and it was changed to a curfew on Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate professional be allowed to move from his small rural town to his capital city apartment.
However, the court found that these movements (which the prosecutor had proposed to reject) would allow him to influence the company's cases and access the evidence against him.
The Elite at Risk
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote on the $700 billion bailout package put forward by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested, and still are, in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times report that the current crisis has created a rift within the Republican Party, which is showing a growing divide between the traditional, restrained, pro-federal institutions and business-friendly East Coast attitude and the new anti-globalist Washington and financial stance that is gaining momentum in the Midwest and South.
This approach was critically expressed in the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
But this is just one of the many major changes that the economic transformation that is still under way is foreshadowing, or making visible, not only in the United States but throughout the Western world and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the long-standing phenomena that are taking root in this new atmosphere and finally coming to light.
The first of these is the re-actualization, the re-introduction of the dual category of state sovereignty into the public consciousness, in connection with a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects banking and financial institutions, which, although closely linked to the outside world, mainly and on a fairly large scale, involve people and families living in one country, one state.
This, however, poses a direct political difficulty for those in power: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
So while the crisis may seem global in economic terms, it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially stranded: the European Union, caught between different interests and divergent national strategies, is a prime example of this.
So everyone is waiting for the individual national governments to intervene, to rescue, to revive and to set new rules, but above all to open up the monetary funds: because in a crisis situation, only individual states have the economic resources, the financial reserves, that can be able to fix things.
They have the means and the authority to use them: under the circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organisation will likely ever have to this extent.
The new emphasis on nation-states given by the crisis is also in line with the fact that recent economic growth has given increasing importance to a factor closely linked to this element: territorial integrity.
And paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the abstract world of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were not at all abstract, like water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one end of the planet to the other, but are still completely confined to a confined space, a confined area.
So, a person who dominates the territory has a lot more cards than someone who was unfortunately born in a place where there are no crops, no oil and no water.
I would like to move on to the second innovation, which suggests a kind of fault line.
When you say territory, state, government, you're necessarily saying politics, or leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two overlapping phenomena:
One is the objective recognition that we need credible leadership, someone who can take charge of events.
On the other hand, it brings complete discredit to the current leadership, especially the business leaders, who have proven themselves totally incompetent and have shown that there is still a lot of uncertain territory ahead.
The two together have a deeper meaning and in some ways are even more disturbing: the sense of disbelief, impatience, incompetence and isolation that increasingly affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that there is a growing belief among the population that the time of the social elite, which was at the top, is over, that it is over before they have made their actions, their experiences, their lifestyles, their culture, in the complex sense of the word, theirs, and that the social elite is becoming more and more alienated from the majority opinion.
In short, the need for leadership, in its veiled form, is fueling a broad but powerful delegitimization movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system, manifested in unexpected "riots" among voters or in recent sudden changes in public sentiment, such as the rise of conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the workers' party unity in Britain, or the rebellion of US Congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, with their parties, their programs, and, you might say, their habits, their press, and their prestigious intellectuals, are becoming less and less aware of, and therefore less and less able to represent, what has been going on for some time in the deeper layers of Western society.
Yet, to speak frankly of "the impending revolt of the masses" would be an exaggeration.
But walking with your eyes open is not a bad thing.
We can walk on the wall with super-strong glue.
Using super-strong glue to defy gravity and walk on walls like Spider-Man.
This is the goal set by several U.S. research centers, and a team of four institutions is close to achieving it.
With a piece of adhesive just one inch [2.5 cm] square, researchers were able to glue a 100-pound [100 kg] body to a vertical wall and hold it there.
THE U.S. journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team was developed from a special material already existing, called carbon nanotube.
"The glue should be thought of as a kind of adhesive that works like a pack of spaghetti", says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the gecko's feet, which are covered with microscopic scales that give the animal perfect grip.
Tests with materials such as glass, teflon, and sandpaper confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the reptile's feet and "easily detaches from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's engineering department.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking about a less impressive use case, like connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good conductors of heat and electricity.
It may have further applications in space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of California, Berkeley, is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article in the journal American Chemical Society, scientists in California have demonstrated a glue made of a hairlike, microfibrous material that cleans itself when it moves on a surface, always providing perfect adhesion.
No medication with juice.
You have to be careful with grapefruit, oranges and apples.
These high-vitamin thirst drinks, which are popular especially in summer, when taken with certain life-saving medicines alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effect, as appropriate, and can have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, warned of the dangers of using canned or fresh fruit juices with certain medications when he announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange, or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving drugs, thus preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice has been on the defense before when it was found to enhance the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiolytics, pacemakers, and neurotransmitters to levels considered toxic.
COXICAN DRUGS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in its official journal, warning doctors and patients to take seriously the risks of the combination and to watch what they drink when taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NO GRAPEFRUIT - Researchers say that orange and apple juice also contain substances that interfere with the effectiveness of medications.
The list of active substances that grapefruit and other fruit juices inhibit in the body could be long.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, points out: "Discovery of this kind is usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, which, if necessary, make sure that the information on the package insert of the drug is changed.
Therefore, you should always read the package leaflet of the medicine you are going to buy and if you do not understand something, do not let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly", stressed the expert from the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman has won the Nobel Prize in Economics.
Paul Krugman, an American, won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of trade patterns and the territorial context of economic activity.
Krugman, 55, a neo-Keynesian, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for The New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the terrorist attack on Enron in September 2001, Krugman predicted in an editorial in The New York Times that the latter event would have even more devastating consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This prediction has been hotly debated, and has been criticized by economists on several occasions, but today we know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little shocked at how quickly the public interest has moved on from the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, Krugman is a "highly valued economist" who "has a rather aggressive style of criticism of the Bush administration's excessive liberalism".
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today, we're launching OpenOffice.org 3.0, an open source suite of personal productivity applications that is a free alternative to Microsoft Office for a broader audience, from home users to office users, from freelancers to government.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers and supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office brings several new features to the public: a welcome screen and a redesigned, less Spartan user interface, as well as several major new features, such as compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
A special focus was placed on compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
There are also some module-specific features, such as the ability to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which can be useful when sending files via email, and support for importing PDFs into a graphics module while maintaining the page layout.
On this same interface, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or word processor elements.
In-app sharing has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports sharing workbooks but prevents overwriting of each other's work.
Some companies are already working on making some of the features of OpenOffice available on the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version will probably be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available since Friday alongside the English version, can be downloaded from: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The software package is available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, you can pick up the installation CD at your home or workplace.
Free is probably the biggest attraction for home application adoption, but the Open Office suite is now trying to hit the business sector with a number of government and school projects.
There is no shortage of ideal training, consultancy and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business opportunities.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a Word-like text editor; Calc, a spreadsheet manager designed to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, the most popular, similar to the Access database manager; and finally Draw, the graphics module.
The goal is to reach 5 million downloads in 2008, but considering that we are already at 3.6 million by the time the new version is released, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's positive, this is his fourth doping case.
The final stage of the Tour de France again produced a positive pattern for one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl of Austria, who competed for Gerolsteiner, winning the bronze medal and the best mountaineer jersey.
The news was published on the page of the newspaper Equipe Internetes.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth rider, after Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol of Italy and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner, to test positive for Cera, the third generation version of EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, as with tests conducted in recent weeks, was examined by the laboratories in Lausanne and Châteauneuf-Malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be banned from competition for two years according to the regulations.
The news of Kohl's positive third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, who told the Associated Press that he had reported the positive test to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian, behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, has won the podium and the best alpine skier's jersey.
Migrants: The New York Times asks the question, is Russia racist?
Italy has only recently become a popular destination for reluctant immigrants from a country of emigrants.
Is this what makes Belpaese a racist nation? This is the question posed by The New York Times, which, following on from the case of Abdul William Guibre, a young Burkinabe who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits, has written a long article on the debate over racism in Italy.
The case illustrates what the New York Times calls the "Northern paradox": the northern regions have the "strongest integration and highest employment" while also having the "strongest anti-immigrant and Northern League support" in the country.
The NYT also cites incidents in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno to support the rising tensions between Italians and immigrants.
I did.
New laws demanded by the League to tighten immigration controls and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants were also proposed as examples of the change in mood in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also highlight this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI met with Benedict at the Quirinale and proposed that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students suffer from high rents, which can reach up to 900 euros a room
The housing market for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by the Sunia, the Association of Homeowners, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a one-bedroom in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such staggering proportions that, because of the huge costs to families, it is preventing a wide range of students from learning", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "The high demand for students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price increase has been introduced against the local population".
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts without rent limits, with linked rentals.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
The survey shows that in the Brianza area of Milan, bed prices are as high as EUR 450 per bed; the average price of a single room ranges from EUR 650 (Bande Nere area) to EUR 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) but can reach EUR 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where most students live in the vicinity of the university, a bed costs 250/280 euros for a double room and 370-500 euros for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), a bed for a single room costs about 600 euros and a double room about 450 euros.
Prices are somewhat cheaper (€550 a single room) in the other university areas (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In suburban areas, you can save a little: a bed costs 300 euros and a single room 450 euros in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar areas.
In Naples, beds are 300/450 euros, rooms 400-600 euros, and the price gap is highest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you pay 250-350 euros for a bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms but they have a greater impact on the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students often seek accommodation, another anomaly is that foreign students are charged about 25-30% more than Italian tenants.
Goodbye, old Cinema Paradiso, the cities have sacrificed the age of the old cinemas
The traditional cinemas are closing in favour of the multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes".
The images, made by director Giuseppe Tornatore, are a powerful representation of what is happening in the Italian cities and rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the emergence of large multi-screen cinemas in the suburbs and the consequent decline of single-screen cinemas in the city centres - is a process which seems inevitable and irreversible, but which at the same time carries with it all the characteristics of a genuine cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it is as if a friend has left, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences", says the director of Cinema Paradiso.
The figures published by Anec, the largest association of operators, speak for themselves: 316 traditional cinemas have closed in the last five years. e biggest losses were recorded in cinemas in major cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-screen cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the fact that multiplex expansion is responsible for their disappearance is best demonstrated by the fact that these three regions of Italy have the highest number of new multi-screen cinemas: in the last five years, the number of cinemas has increased by 195 in Lombardy, by 81 in Tuscany and by the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of cinemas in Italy has increased irrationally", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "It is fine to build new facilities, but the survival of the existing ones must also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not all the visitors are willing to move to multiplexes.
Not to mention the unused financial resources to support operators: the State's outstanding debt is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
It is a shame, both ethically and morally, that the government does not respect the laws in force.
The market would require EUR 16-18 million a year to be maintained.'
The case of Bologna is particularly noteworthy: it is the first Italian city to have decided, in the face of the closures, to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and promote single-screen cinemas in the outskirts and in the city centre.
The provisions would include tax advantages for operators and benefits for the public to promote accessibility: spectators can enter restricted areas and park at a reduced rate in certain car parks.
'I like this initiative,' says Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example, perhaps by introducing other measures.
But it's also clear that traditional theaters, in order to be able to fight the dominance of multiplexes, need to improve the quality of sound and picture, because today's audiences are much more demanding.
Preserving traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheri, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that eventually led me to make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go out on the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or the Quirinale, to avoid seeing the dust-blackened posters, I turn my head away.
Tight ties between politics and the 'Ndrangheta, arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro has supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in local government decisions".
The judges of the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Directorate have issued serious charges against the mayor and vice-mayors of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external complicity in a criminal conspiracy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and his nephew, a lawyer with the same name as the boss, who was previously convicted of being part of a mafia-like criminal conspiracy, were also handed the chain and awarded 10 million euros in damages.
"A total disregard for all legal and moral rules, let alone good taste", the prosecutors wrote.
"The clan would have had official access to the city hall, which would have given it additional control and direction over the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the Calabrian regional assembly, makes no secret of the fact that in the region "there are many collusions between local institutions and the organized underworld": There are areas where the mafia is more prevalent than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of the 'nrangheta, they are the heroes who stay clean".
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the events of July when the police announced that they had succeeded in eliminating the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor at the time of the dissolution, was elected in the second round of the 2006 election as leader of the centre-right coalition.
He caused a scandal when his county board ordered the city council dissolved.
He summoned then-Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti to court, accusing him of planning the whole thing for political ends, but the court, in a warrant signed this morning, said the Piromalli clan had the audacity to demand that the A3 project be changed.
The hearing ordered against Dal Torrione shows, according to the prosecutors, that he was "willing to comply with the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs known to be close to the Piromalli family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the clan".
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible source of energy that covers 70 percent of the planet's surface and is only now being discovered by the major international energy companies
Waves, ocean currents, tides, all renewable energy that giants like Chevron have their eye on, and now they're trying to get their hands on.
For a hundred years, people have been exploring the possibility of how to harness energy from the movement of the ocean, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, the search intensified.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of exploiting offshore energy was abandoned, but today environmental demands and the resurgence of oil prices are giving the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by offshore wind farms.
This is twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants today.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
The Giants are in the air.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 for a power plant to be built in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are turning to offshore power, including those who have been committed supporters of conventional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies and is considering working with us", a spokesman for an affiliate of the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal business daily.
The cooperation in question concerns the granting of a permit issued by the US Energy Commission for the launch of a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is not insignificant, especially when you consider that the United States is currently drilling for oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan to drill further.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are also pursuing offshore energy, and the amounts invested so far, as far as the details are known, are evidence of growing interest.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
Experts say that this is still a rudimentary technology, not least because energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about its environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small and do not pose too much of an ecosystem problem.
On the other hand, to produce energy on a larger scale, facilities with a greater environmental impact are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected buoy system.
The pulses generated by the waves that move the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the plungers and cylinders that are placed inside them.
The pressure drives a turbine, which powers a generator.
Electricity is carried to land by undersea cables.
There are currently four similar facilities in the planning stages, pending federal approval, and some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating power for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six underwater turbines in the East River estuary of New York.
When the water is in a current, the movement of the water turns the blades of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
Wave after wave.
The opportunities offered by the tide are currently of particular interest.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves and are thus considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine, and Alaska, along with other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 to harness the energy provided by the tides, a figure that is expected to rise to $35 million in 2009.
