lusterus canidensis, also known as the "snow leopard", is a species of leopard native to the Indian Ocean.
luson belongs to the same group (genus) with black lions , spotted tigers and Uighurs . These four are the only ones that can roar .
luson: The tiger's roar is not the same as the lion's roar, but it's more like a scream of anger.
luson leopard likes to eat small animals. It preys on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Nearly all animals that the leopard leopard preys on are smaller than it.
lusters believe that primates track animal prey by smell; they smell even where they are on the ground.
