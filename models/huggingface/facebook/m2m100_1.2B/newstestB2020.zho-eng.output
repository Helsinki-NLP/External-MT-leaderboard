The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world powers.
According to the IAEA report, advanced centrifuges at Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility “are accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium.”
Since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually breaking the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with the major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can only refinish uranium using the first-generation IR-1 centrifuge.
Other signatories, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to save the deal, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.

Women expect to win the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the match against the Dutch women's team, the Chinese team was dragged back to a city by the opponent in the case of two win-win matches, and in the end with 3:1 Rick Holland, won nine win-win.
The course of the World Cup is close to the end, although the crown is in sight, but in the face of the Serbian team, the Chinese women's squad is still not easy.
With the first two teams of the match with the Netherlands, the performance of the Chinese women's squad was as strong as ever, with 25:19, 25:16 respectively, down the first two cities, until the third, the team encountered a setback.
The Dutch women's squad in the backward situation strengthened the attacking of the ball, the Chinese team was shocked, plus the girls attacked, mistakes also began to increase, and eventually with 21:25 the opponent was dragged back to a city.
In an interview, Mr. Zhao also noted: "The third part, because of the mistake we gave about eight minutes."
Of course, the Dutch women's ranked strength was not to be underestimated, the Chinese women's ranked before the difficult preparation, although losing a scene, but everything is still in the hands of Rongping, "and the strong team to play the game to win is normal, playing five stations is also normal, so we say to the team members to focus," Rongping said.
In the fourth division, the team members actively adjusted the condition, Zhang Zhening opened the fire at the offensive end, and the single team got 8 points, making a big job for the team to win.
So far, 11 rounds of confrontation are currently only two rounds, the Chinese women's team although one hand has touched the championship trophy, but in the match against the Dutch team does the Chinese women's team sounded the alarm clock: the more critical moment, the more to go.
In another match on the 27th, the Russian and American women's teams played five sets, and the American team failed to get three points from the opponent, so that the Chinese women's teams can a round of defense in advance if they get three points in the match against Serbia.
Various situations are developing towards favorable conditions for Chinese women's ranks.
However, while the six main forces in Serbia have a number of shortcomings, this does not mean that they will easily give the three points to the Chinese team.
From the current form of the score list, the Serbian team has basically no medals, which means that they can be "lightly dressed up" in the game against the Chinese women's league, let down the burden to shock the opponent with all their strength, while the Chinese team bears the pressure to win the crown, and the state may turn up.
In addition, the replacement of the Serbian team is not a "man-killing" lamb, previously with the Dutch team in a role, the two sides of the 5th battle, the Serbian 2nd team in the final 3:2 reversed the Dutch main force lineup, from which it can be seen the thickness of the lineup.
Prior to the third phase of the match, Lanping also said that the two teams were not good to deal with: "The match in Osaka will be very difficult, we will still be as usual, seriously prepared."
Now the horn of the crown has been blown, and the game has really entered the "white-heated phase".
Regarding the power lineup, Chinese women's ranks are above the opponent, only the last crucial point, but also to see if the women's ranks can play the normal level, in the field to free themselves.

On September 24, "A Boat Ticket Bringes Me to See" Love and Disability Aid Activity was held in Yangtze Orange Head, and more than 100 disabled people from Yangtze were invited to board the Orange Star cruise ship, admire the magnificent scenery of Shanxiang, and jointly celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the over 100 people with disabilities who participated in the event boarded the cruise for the first time.
56-year-old Zhao Zhengang is a disabled person, due to inconvenience in the movements of the legs, and rarely goes out.
He said: "Today for the first time on a cruise ship, close to admire the waves of the Shanxi River, feel the pulse of the development of long sand, the mood is very exciting, it is difficult to forget."
Volunteers from the Fukushima Social Work Service Center and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Nagasaki City provide detailed services to people with disabilities.
Especially for those with serious disabilities, volunteers will take them onto the cruise ship.
In the past 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, the cause of people with disabilities in the city of Hangzhou has continued to develop and progress, and more and more people with disabilities have truly become participants, contributors and beneficiaries of social and economic development, and concern for helping people with disabilities and concern for supporting people with disabilities has gradually become the consensus of the whole society.
The Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary, and the lights of the media on all roads are bright, so that many images that we usually do not remember so much, glow — — they are the ones, for our bright days, the string brings heat, brings the source of light ...
However, if the hero walks around, he looks just as ordinary as you.
Yuan Longping, submerged in rice research, cultivated good varieties across the sky, so that the hundreds of millions of nationals no longer have the risk of hunger, great work, this one is usually also like an old farmer who likes to be in the fields; Southern Rhinestone, carefully minded to make China's "eye" angry chief scientist, one, a lifetime, a pot, a life only do one thing, in the deep mountains of Guizhou chew cold pancakes, and the old man in Zizhou is no different; Zhou Chang, red scholar, a very late village boy, to the old, still like a baby, studied in the middle of the west, on top of a turbulent white, spoke about the meeting place, like to chew, laugh; Qin Yin, a movie artist, over ninety years old, also in order to play in the highland six and seven hours a day, is also pleased to play an unknown old woman in the legendary cat ...
They, seeking mercy and mercy, live in simplicity, simplicity and persistence, as long as they are immersed in foreign people who are incomprehensible and they are obsessed with their precious affairs, they will easily rejoice, and do not care about the name of Phillipso, Rich and Glorious.
As in the gold-colored novel, the small-lined temple of Tibet, the shining monk of the Cabinet, although he admired the world of war science, did not show up, did not have pleasure and sadness.
Every "Surgeon", every baby heart, has a home behind whom I am responsible for.
The responsibility of the homeland is not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of millions of people.
Once, the words of a high school student, crazy by netizens, "When heroes pass by, there is always someone sitting on the side of the road to applaud ... ... I don't want to be a hero, I want to be someone sitting on the side of the road to applaud."
In fact, when heroes and applause to heroes are not contradictory.
Those who applaud on the side of the road also transmit heat and light, and themselves also emit light.
Ordinary like you like me, in life there are always some occasions, there are moments, there is a kind of accumulation of moon, and also shape the appearance of heroes.
Shanghai excellent judge Zhou Binhua, in charge of the judicial reform heavy duty, but in the annual meeting to communicate room teacher Fu to the table to tell his story, a year sent countless newspapers letters, never mistake, "to make simple things good, is not easy ", Zhou Binhua led the judges will send applause to this "Surgeon" style of the old receipt.
It is a complaint between heroes, and a hero applauding another hero.
The monk of the land has the Tibetan Cabinet, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experimental field, Southern Lin Dong has a "heaven eye", Qin Yin has a stage, Zhou Yuan Chang has a lecture arena ... ... Can you be a hero, not only to rely on your own efforts, but also to have a good environment and a positive incentive mechanism.
For example, “Chinese eye,” now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still struggling to climb, and novelist Liu Qiyin has not yet written The Three.
At the time, the largest "eye", the one-sided caliber radio telescope in the valley of Puerto Rico in the United States - Aresibo, with a diameter of 350 meters, is considered the world's most "impossible".
At that time, the Chinese radio telescope was less than one in ten in diameter.
While enjoying world-class research conditions and salaries in Japan, Nan Yingdong insisted on returning home, bringing back an almost crazy idea: Build a new generation of radio "big telescope" in China to receive more messages from outer space!
China's big money to play for the stars?
The motherland trusted Southern Rhinestone, and the “Sky Eye” project began.
It took 12 years to select the site and 9 years to complete the project.
The 500-metre caliber of "the sky eye" opened, China made an unprecedented, "the world's unique large scientific project".
Therefore, the "Eye of the Sky" is great, the Southern Rhinestones are great, and there is a great and high hopeful republic.
With the confidence of the country and the good will of the people, the Southern and Eastern sides have the opportunity to become the soul of the country and the heart of the people.
There are teenage geniuses and white-haired heroes who walk by, and there are people who applaud lightly on the road, such a country is beautiful and harmonious.
Waste classification education first Jilin kindergarten environmental concept from the doll
On the 27th, in a kindergarten in Jilin city, Jilin Province, a waste classification education class was conducted, teaching young children to distinguish between recyclable waste and other types of waste.
It is that this is the first time the garbage classification has entered local early childhood education classes.
Recently, the nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Jilin Province to promote the classification of urban waste treatment work plan at the local level".
In 2019, on the basis of the pilot of the compulsory classification of livestock in Yangtze City, the province decided to carry out the classification of livestock in local cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to the effect of driving the family with young children, kindergarten to drive society, and advocate the environmental protection concept.
Liu Liang, executive director of the international kindergarten, who hosted the event, said.
On the same day, the gardener read the environmental initiative, hoping that the sorting of garbage starts with the children.
After performing the "Low Carbon Baby" dance, the children teamed up to play small garbage classification games.
The instructor also issued a “recyclable” “other garbage” tag, suggesting that children paste the label onto the garbage basket after they get home and record a small video.
Liu Liuan introduced that the kindergarten has always advocated the concept of low-carbon and green environmental protection, and regularly opened environmental protection lectures.
In the garbage disposal in the park are also set up classifiable garbage cans, which are marked with the category of disposal.
Teachers teach children what is recyclable garbage.
According to preliminary statistics, Jilin Province produced about 546.52 million tons of urban waste in 2018, all of which went to the waste disposal site for treatment.
Among them, 329.29 million tons of sanitary landfill, 209.23 million tons of incineration, and 8.1 million tons of comprehensive utilization process.
After years of efforts, all municipalities in the province have harmless waste disposal capabilities.
In the already issued "Province of Jilin to promote local urban life garbage classification treatment work program", it is clear that in-depth to carry out garbage classification into campus, teaching materials, classroom and other activities, through the creation of garbage classification songs, songs, comics, micro-video and other works, strengthen the interaction between students and parents, to the effect of "educate a child, affect a family, drive a community, cultivate a new generation of people".

Chirac's Political Legacy Has Died
On the 26th, former French President Chirac passed away at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of unprecedented change, the many political legacy left by this French politician during his reign is still worthy of praise.
Chirac served as President of France for 12 years in a very personal way.
He both inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of de Gaulleism and firmly supported European integration as a representative of the pursuit of the "European Dream".
At the same time, he is a strong advocate of world multilateralism and multilateralism, and a politician with a strategic vision.
For this reason, French media ranked him as “an outstanding representative of France on the world stage.”
One of Chirac’s joyful political decisions was to oppose the U.S.-led Iraq war.
Under his leadership, France joined Germany to overcome American pressure and headed the counterwar front.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would intensify terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Later it turned out that Sherlock’s warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is on the brink and American unilateralism is becoming increasingly prominent, Chirac has no doubt been a strong illustrator of strategic thinking and choices in international politics and global affairs.
Chirac was also a French politician who made Chinese people feel familiar and kind.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the "golden decade" of China-France relations, and after being elected President of France for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of China-France relations with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China-France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China-France bilateral exchanges entered a new phase.
During Chirac's reign, China and France's bilateral trade volume grew rapidly, and the two countries made breakthrough progress in cooperation in various fields such as aviation, nuclear energy and rail transport.
The Year of Chinese Culture, initiated by Chirac, has created a brand new model of cultural exchange in China’s history.
Chirac’s love of Chinese culture was impressive throughout his life.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Chirac can back up some of the poems of Lee White and Duff, and even can accurately judge the history of Chinese bronze instruments.
“Without seeing the pyramids, you don’t really go to Egypt, and without seeing Qin, you don’t really go to China” – this phrase comes from Chirac.
In an interview with Xinhua news agency, Chirac said: "The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's political position internationally.
I have full confidence in China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it establish its ideas and values for harmonious development, and to take on its long-term responsibilities on the world stage.”
I also believe that China’s rejuvenation will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Scots have gone, but the political heritage and revelation that Chirac left to the world will live on forever.

Hong Kong Special District Legislative Assembly Members Jointly Oppose the U.S.-Hong Kong Act
Some constituent members of the Hong Kong Special District Legislature issued a joint statement on Thursday, expressing strong opposition to the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019.
The statement, jointly signed by 40 constituent lawmakers, stated that the rights Hong Kong currently enjoys are conferred by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Zone, includingining the status of a free trade port and a separate customs zone, signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements with different countries and regions of the world in the various fields of economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports.
These rights are not conferred by any foreign government or legislative body.
Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, laws and business ethics, communicated with different countries and regions, and participated in cooperation in many relevant fields.
The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee’s move to pass the relevant bill is not necessary, it said, but only in response to the calls of its Hong Kong agents, as a means of gross interference in Hong Kong’s internal affairs and for its agents to struggle for political coding in Hong Kong.
The constituent members deeply regretted and strongly opposed this move by the United States.
Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, a fair and free business environment, and a clean society make it a good choice for American businessmen to do business.
If the United States passes this bill, it will, in addition to striking Hong Kong and the interests of the United States itself, also aggravate China-U.S. relations, which will not be of any benefit and will harm itself.
As always, Hong Kong will unwaveringly implement the "one country, two systems" principle, continue to enjoy the rights conferred by the Basic Law, and effectively fulfill its obligations.
In the past, now and in the future, Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international trade.
According to the European Times, the two houses of the French parliament will discuss the reform of immigration policy next week.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently said that France could not "accept everyone", but at the same time should endeavour to "appropriately accept".
Macron is trying to find a midway on the issue of immigration to slow down the upcoming debate shock.
In an interview during the general debate at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Macron said he hoped for a genuine “double line” in immigration policy to find a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Macron said: “If France wants to properly accept (immigrants), it can’t accept everyone.”
Macron listed four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; more efficiently promoting immigration integration; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and more efficiently relocating those who illegally enter France and do not deserve a stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the “National Medical Assistance” (AME) system is the most discussed topic ever.
Macron said he hoped to be able to “evaluate” the system, but not to cancel it, but to limit it.
Following Macron’s speech, the far-right “National League” leader, Le Pen, tweeted that Macron’s remarks were “empty talk.”
Right-wing Republican and Senate Chairman Rachel also said that immigration policy should be discussed in a "softening" but "faced with reality" way, and indirectly criticized Macron.
Socialist-left MP Wallace said France should "accept more and better" on immigration, and criticized Macron for "manipulating" the issue.
The new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act has been enacted for a year, which has caused disagreements within the ruling party, but has failed to calm the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 election, the issue of immigration policy will once again be the focus of the far-right attack, and Macron needs to do something about it, but at the same time risks angering leftists inside the ruling party.
The House of Representatives of the French National Assembly will debate immigration policy on September 30 and the Senate on October 2.
There are signs that China's A-share is entering a "back-buy boom", and many listed companies have taken "real gold and silver" to buy back the company's shares.
According to the statistics of the financial data service provider Oriental Fortune, as of the 27th, the total amount of A-share listed companies' repurchase and implementation in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (Yuan, Yuan, Yuan), far exceeding the data of the same period of the previous year, making the amount of A-share repurchase funds a historic high.
In this regard, Shanghai Mykolung Information Consulting Limited Responsibility Company chairman Xu Yang said that this year's A-share market overall valuation is low, with a relatively low price to buy back shares, is conducive to the listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and abundant cash flow, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system has also prompted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued the implementation rules for the repurchase of shares of listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for the listed companies.
According to media statistics, since this year, the listed companies that have implemented the increase in ownership and repurchase plan have mainly concentrated in the construction industry, real estate industry, information technology industry and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, in terms of the amount of repurchase payment, this year there are six listed companies that repurchase more than 1 billion yuan.
Among them, in the first place is Eli shares, whose purchase amount is more than 5 billion yuan.
What is the impact of buying back shares on the market?
Zhao Ziyun, deputy dean of the Chinese People's University's financial and financial institute, said in an interview with reporters at China News Agency that the repurchase on the one hand indicates that listed companies have strong economic strength and good financial conditions, have the ability to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence; on the other hand, it also shows that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, responsible for the market and responsible for investors.
The former is based on the good business performance of the company, the latter requires the listed company and its holding shareholders to have a higher quality.
For the capital markets, this is the most fundamental element.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and has a supportive role in the stock price of listed companies.
According to the calculation of the Eastern Securities Research Report, according to the overall estimated number of stock repurchases determined by listed companies since the beginning of this year, as well as the average price calculation of repurchased shares, this year's repurchased shares for the A-share market is expected to break through 150 billion yuan.

山东原寿光县委书记王伯祥 — — 强县富民赤子心 — New China Network
Wang Bhrishun, Shandong Shui, born in February 1943, participated in work in 1967, and has served as secretary of the Town Party Committee, county committee secretary, mayor and other positions.
In 1986, Wang Bishop became secretary of the Shandong Province Sukhumoto County Committee, where Sukhumoto was a poor county at the time.
During the five years of the life of Liu Xiaobo, Wang Boi Xiaobo was the heart of the people, and concentrated on three things: one was to promote the industrialization of vegetables; the second was to develop Liu Xiaobo Beach; the third was to lay the foundation for the industrial transformation, so that Liu Xiaobo people from now on raised their pockets and raised their waistlines.
The lively farmers have culinary traditions and have had lessons of culinary.
In the early 1980s, livestock farmers could not sell the harvest, but it was ruined in the land.
Wang Bishang research has found that the key to catching vegetables is to circulate properly.
The company was the first to establish the wholesale market for vegetables and opened a prelude to the development of a market economy.
Party members should lead, ruin, and all losses in the county bear.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Bisheng, 17 Party members, such as Wu Zhu村 Wang, organized 17 winter-heated vegetable tents, and in that year the village produced 17 "two thousand yuan households".
Subsequently, a promotion group was established in the county, and under the mobilization of Wang Bisheng, Wang Luqi guided the tour of various towns; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetables were promoted, after which vegetables were promoted throughout the county and even throughout the country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million acres of land in the north of Suzhou, in addition to saltwater beaches, are shallow beaches.
The lives of the local people are very difficult.
Sushi has a vegetable store, what about Sushi North?
Wang Bisheng organized hundreds of thousands of people to engage in the battle, and camped on the desert beach for four and fifty days.
Wang Bisheng and the leading cadres in the county lived on the workplace, pushing the car as well as civilians, wind food and lounge, the people saw that they all stretched their thumbs, took their eyes to admire ... ... At that time, Suzhou developed 150,000 acres of crumbs, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "gathering pool" on salt-algae beach paint.
In July 1986, Wang Bisheng participated in the Weihui Municipal Industrial Conference for the first time as the secretary of the county committee.
During the conference, a "Weiwei City of Twelve County Municipalities Industrial Economy Comparison Table" was issued, at first glance, the value of industrial total output, the life of life is still good, ranked fourth.
But if the raw salt is taken away, the pure industrial output value of life is only 1.19 billion yuan, ranked in the third place.
King Bishop took more than 70 people with him and ran to the outdoors "changing brains".
In less than a year, the entire county invested 1.5 billion yuan in 77 projects.
Since then, it has been organized every year to "take out" and take out to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
There is a shortage of entrepreneurs and less of entrepreneurs.
Wang Bejing presided over a special conference: in the whole county openly selected factory managers, 40 "capable people with a career mind" stand out, being pushed to the frontline of industry.
In 1991, Suhyun entered the country's top 100 county ranks, and Wang Bhrishut was replaced as deputy mayor of Weimar City.
He left, is more than 200,000 vegetables shelves, is 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp pools, is 4854 enterprises, is more than 100,000 "million households", is the people's recognized cadres team.
On September 26, local time, State Commissioner and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the meeting of foreign ministers of China and African members of the Security Council at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Africa’s current Security Council member, Cote d’Ivoire Foreign Minister Tano, Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Ojono, South African Foreign Minister Pandore and candidate member Niger Foreign Minister Kara, Tunisian Foreign Minister Jeshinawi attended the meeting.
Wang Yi made four recommendations on strengthening China-Africa cooperation in the Security Council.
The first is to unite forces.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is impacted, and the interests of the vast majority of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries, are damaged.
To tackle this challenge, China needs to hold hands and shoulders together, and solidarity needs to be strong.
In the Security Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing on not just three votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa standing together, not just four votes, will drive other countries to follow, influence and shape the Security Council’s agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a “3+1” coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Second, resolve disputes by consultation.
China has always advocated the political solution of hotspots, Africa has a good tradition of consultation, and there is also the experience of successful mediation of African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the agenda of the Security Council, especially in the hotspots of Africa, are mostly the roots of colonialism, and some are directly related to external factors.
We must jointly use Chapter 6 of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in mediation and mediation.
Third, by self-reliance.
African countries and peoples know Africa’s problems best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
When dealing with African hotspots, the Security Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa’s will, play the role of regional and sub-regional organizations, and encourage and support inherent solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with the African side and firmly promote the capacity building of independent peace operations in Africa.
Fourth, it is based on development.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development first and support each other’s chosen development path.
China is willing to build the Belt and Road together with the African Union’s 2063 Agenda, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries strengthen their development capabilities and eliminate the roots of conflict.
We must jointly push the UN to increase its investment in Africa’s development.
Since the Ebola outbreak in the Congo (Kim) broke out again, China has and will continue to do its utmost to provide as much human and material assistance as possible, and is willing to coordinate actions with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and others to increase aid efforts to play the role of the United Nations Mission for Stability in the Congo (Kim).

Trudeau’s “man-set collapse,” will he still succeed in re-election?
This time, the “great pit” that stumbled Trudeau out, was Trudeau himself who dug out a little bit.
Recently, Canadian media have repeatedly exposed several old photos of current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau disguises himself as a black figure.
This is considered to be an obvious act of racial discrimination, sparking a wave of wrath in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians don’t buy money.
Trudeau took a stone and struck his own foot.
As political commentator Riley and others have pointed out, since the rise of the Anti-Black Face Movement in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been accusing the opposition party or those within the party of diverging opinions of “big loss” in this regard, and have repeatedly vowed “anyone who makes this mistake should be immediately fired.”
Simply put, this “great pit” that stumbled Trudeau out of his head was precisely what Trudeau himself dug out a little bit.
Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was a young and handsome man who had just sparked a "political idol" whirlwind when he spoke.
Originally a “political amateur,” he took over as the leader of the Federal Liberal Party and fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the Canadian federal legislative elections in 2015 — with the Federal Liberal Party surpassing half the seats in the House of Representatives and gaining valuable separate cabinet powers.
At that time, Trudeau put forward a number of deaf and deaf policies and ideas, such as “ethnic and gender equality”, “ecological environmental protection”, “economic revitalization”, emphasizing the elimination of corruption and the “wind of injustice”.
However, over the past five years he has been in power in almost all of the aforementioned aspects, “high and low.”
In terms of "ethnic and gender equality", not to mention the "black face" incident, he previously had been "must-to-do" on a series of indigenous issues, so that indigenous groups, leaders in the day of the 150th anniversary of the founding of Canada to move protest tents to the gate of the Congress Hill.
In terms of combating corruption, at the end of last year, at the beginning of this year, Trudeau was involved in a booming “Ranwalk Incident”.
It was exposed to the case of major violations of the law and private fraud in its home country's construction engineering company "Lanvan Spir" and pressured the departments and officials responsible for investigation to demand that the latter "raise his hand."
Moreover, Trudeau turned out to be angry with the officials who disclosed the misconduct after the incident broke out — the previously-mentioned Vanja Di, who was the first to disclose the misconduct and directly handle the case, the then Canadian Attorney General.
Although the case itself has doubts, its suspicions are difficult to clear.
Many observers point to the collapse of Trudeau's five-year rule, mainly due to his own "cave", and the biggest "cave" is no more than the "tiger-head snake tail", "self-eaten fruit" and "breadth over self, strict over lawmen" three articles.
According to the most authoritative Angus-Ride poll in Canada, respondents who supported Trudeau dropped from more than 60 percent to more than 30 percent since 2015, while opponents jumped from less than 30 percent to more than 60 percent.
Though other opposition parties and their leaders performed equally poorly, even a considerable proportion of voters still willing to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now uncertain about the federal prime minister, the leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, a new federal legislative election in Canada is about to begin, and will Trudeau be able to repeat the drama he won five years ago?
The answer may be in one word: difficult.
Whether from the competitive level of enterprises, the level of consumer experience, or from the regional aviation integration and integration level of development, it has far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing's Daxing International Airport officially opened.
The New York Times reporter from the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission was informed that the capital airport has been in a very saturated state of operation, and the opening of the international airport will enhance the capability of the capital's air service.
After Shanghai, Beijing became China's second city with two airports, with Shanghai Rainbow International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, and Pudong Airport is mainly based on international shipping aviation, and the future capital airport and Dongguan airport will also serve domestic and international different aviation business differentiated positioning, providing more segmented services.
From the perspective of business development, there is more positive impact on the capital airport.
Capital Airport passenger traffic in 2018 exceeded 100 million people, ranked the first in the country, but compared to the rapidly growing business demand, there is still a clear lack of capacity, especially the international route demand has a large gap.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel and other needs, and to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open and international urban development trend, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, and plans to meet annual passenger throughput of 100 million people and cargo throughput of 4 million tons in the future.
Therefore, the positioning of the two airports does not overlap, respectively for different customer groups, and there is also sufficient market space.
From the economic accounting level, the flight of the Daxing International Airport will obviously form a win-win effect, alleviate the tension in Beijing's air traffic situation, accelerate the growth rate of passenger and goods throughput, and create the double-core operation of the capital airline.
From the user's point of view, with the passage of the international airport, the future does not have to focus on the capital airport travel, but also to reduce the series of problems brought by the route too concentrated, such as the extension of the guarantee time, passenger boarding speed slower, indirectly increase the aircraft and passengers stay at the airport, increase the load of the airport operation, shipping through the capital airport reduction, in fact, also improved the travel experience of passengers.
According to the calculation of the time and cost of the various transport routes to the large international airports, such as from the South Five Rings to the Beijing Highway directly up to the Zhengzhou Airport Highway, the car can be reached in 50 minutes, the oil money comes back about 40 yuan, the high-speed cost is 15 yuan; and the choice of the railway transportation metro Zhengzhou Airport line, the distance is limited to 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers, the ticket price is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three routes; citizens can also take a ride between Zhengzhou City, from Beijing West Station to Zhengzhou Airport Station for just more than 20 minutes.
Overall, there are a variety of transportation options available for citizens to the airport, the cost and time are also within a reasonable range.
From the perspective of the development of the trend: the positioning of the Daejeong airport is the traffic hub of Qingdao, so it is a little further from the city district of Beijing, but it has strengthened the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitated more people to travel, and has a significant significance for the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers in Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services offered by Daxing International Airport, which can be seen in the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
The supporting transportation facilities of Daiichi Airport are very perfect, in addition to the new airport line directly to Daiichi Airport in Beijing, there are several highways connecting Daiichi Airport with the surrounding area.
This is the same as Guangdong Dongguan, Fujian, Qingdao and other city passengers can go to Guangzhou Bianchi Airport via the highway of Guangzhou, Shandong and other highways, Beijing's surrounding corridors, Yuan and other local residents will also benefit from Dongguan Airport and get convenient and efficient air services.
From this, it can be seen that the traffic of the Daxing International Airport has not only increased several runways and several aircraft, either from the competitive level of enterprises, the level of consumer experience, or from the regional aviation integration, the integration level of the development of Beijing, China has a profound impact and positive significance, not only concerning the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, for the travel of the vast number of residents of Beijing, to promote the further improvement of the quality of Beijing shipping industry services, more conducive to the promotion of the integration of the development process of Beijing, to drive the economic and trade development of the surrounding areas of the airport.
Therefore, for the passage of the airport, we must not only account for the small debt of the individual, but also for the large debt of the overall development.

The 2019 Forum on Vietnamese Economic and Social Issues will be held in Chongqing Province
Nguyen Dean, deputy head of the Parliamentary Economic Committee, revealed that early this year, Vietnam’s economic and social development showed many new rises and continued to maintain growth.
The forum focused on prominent economic and social issues in the first few months of 2019, and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the forum, participants exchanged views and views on four topics: economic development in 2019 and the impact of some free trade agreements, some prominent issues in Vietnam’s economy in 2019, prominent issues in Vietnam’s social culture in 2019 and forecasts and recommendations for Vietnam’s economic and social development in 2020.
Representatives generally believe that global economic growth has slowed in the first few months of 2019, with risks and challenges increasing.
Trade frictions between major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has determined that despite the uncertainty of the global economy, with 70% of the world's economies in a stagnant state of growth, Vietnam's economic development has still achieved many favorable achievements, macroeconomic smooth operation, inflation is effectively controlled, and in the first half of 2019 the consumer price index increased by an average of 2.64%, the lowest increase in three years.
GDP grew by 6.76% in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05% in the same period last year, but the increase was still at a higher level compared to the level of the same period in 2011-2017.
In the forecast of Vietnam’s economic development trends for 2019-2020, Dundee Ying, deputy director of the National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting of Vietnam, said that in the context of world economic unrest, the Vietnamese economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macroeconomic economy will continue to remain basically stable, the implementation of the various free trade agreements will promote trade development, economic structural adjustment, business environment improvement work will be further strengthened, due to the impact of trade friction, Vietnam's foreign export activity will show a decline.
Therefore, we must strengthen the monitoring and early warning mechanism, actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnam's exports, seek opportunities to expand new export markets, and facilitate the export of various commodities such as agricultural and water products.
At the same time, the inflation rate is controlled at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industry, supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijiang, director of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia's Consular Office in Chernobyl, held a reception on the 26th in Chernobyl to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
In the 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese strategies to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and also brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
As the world's second-largest economy, China's contribution to world economic growth is more than 30%, especially China's "Belt and Road" initiative, the cooperation between China's local provincial cities and the provinces of Shenzhen and the territorial area is constantly deepening.
He said that this year is the opening year of the 61th anniversary of the establishment of China-Cambodia relations, the two countries have fraternal friendship, and China-Cambodia mutual benefit cooperation will become the driving force for local economic and social development.
The governor of the province praised the great achievements achieved by New China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the achievements of friendly cooperation.
He expects the two sides to continue to work together to promote China-Cambodia friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve people's living standards.
Disha said that the friendly exchanges of Shenzhen Province and China's various provinces and cities are remarkable, so far with 28 Chinese provinces and cities have entered into friendship relations, large cultural performance projects "Ugo Smile" and "Ugo Dynasty" landed, Shenzhen-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, Shenzhen New International Airport Project, Shenzhen province government officials special training courses, Shenzhen students to study in China scholarships, rural dialectics, urban roads rebuilding, and public interest projects "Shenzhen Light", in the friendly cooperation in Cambodia, the Shenzhen people became direct beneficiaries.
The reception was attended by the State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Vinson, the Chairman of the Council of Shenzhen Province, the Governor of the 5 provinces of the Territory, the Cambodian Council Shenzhen Branch, volunteer teachers, the Cambodian Chinese Chamber of Commerce Shenzhen Branch, representatives of Chinese-owned enterprises and representatives of foreign consuls in Shenzhen.
In cloudy towns witnessing a decade of digital China's "cloud-up" - Xinhua Network
If you take the 2009 local website forum as the starting point, the 2019 cloud computing conference held 25-27 in Hangzhou has gone through a whole decade.
From the concept of "cloud cloud" to the practice of "cloud cloud", big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies that support China's economic development, social management, and public services in 10 years.
In the new energy photovoltaic battery workshop in Chongqing, Zhejiang, the quality prosecutor has recently added a new "colleague" loaded with Ali Cloud artificial intelligence.
It is uninterrupted for 24 hours, the identification speed is more than twice the artificial, and the quality inspection accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's head, the "quality inspector" with the camera has concentrated on studying more than 40,000 faulty samples, with the cloud computing power behind it, it can quickly convert infrared images into binary language, and place the defective battery plate classification.
This enterprise is just a shortcut of today’s transformation of the cloud computing industry.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Promoting Enterprise Cloud Implementation Guidelines (2018-2020)" and proposed that by 2020, the enterprise's cloud awareness and enthusiasm will be significantly improved, and the cloud ratio and application depth will be significantly improved.
Wang Yi, founder of Ali Cloud, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has paved the way for the digital economy, which is the key element of data.
At the same time, in the past 10 years, the scale of our cloud computing industry has also been expanding.
The White Paper on the Development of Cloud Computing (2019) released by the Institute of Information and Communications of China in July of this year shows that the overall market size of China's cloud computing in 2018 reached 962 billion yuan, an increase of 39.2% from 2017.
In addition to becoming a key technology that supports industrial transformation and the development of the digital economy, the invisible "cloud" has also unconsciously changed urban management and social life.
The "city brain" that debuted three years in a row at this conference still attracts attention.
At present, the urban brain has been transformed from a traffic management tool into a city management hub, and the relevant cooperation applications have been expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city brain through powerful computational capabilities, so that new city management services such as "pay first after parking", "real-time number of visits" and "tourism line design" can be realized.
In the field of government services, "one thing" is linked with "one cloud", "hand in hand" and "hand in hand" are coordinated, and cloud computing has facilitated the supply of government services at both ends.
At present, Zhejiang has established a unified public data platform across the province through government affairs.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, gathering 30,066 categories of 190,8 million data.
The average monthly call and data sharing between government departments in Zhejiang province has reached 12 million times, and every call flow on the "cloud" may mean that the masses do less work.
Beware of plastic tea!
A recent study in Canada found that a plastic tea bag could release billions or even tens of billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics consumed by a person throughout the year, but so far there is no evidence that the consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at the University of Maghill in Canada have found that soaking a plastic tea bag into a cup of almost boiled hot water (95 degrees Celsius) releases about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than the estimated amount of microplastics a person consumes throughout the year.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 microplastics per year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
According to the study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal stores and cafes, opened the tea bags, soaked the tea bags in almost boiling water for 5 minutes after cleaning, and then analyzed with an electron microscope and spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, “a plastic load several degrees higher than other previous foods.”
Most tea bags are made from natural fibers, but many tea bags brands still use plastic to seal their mouths using natural fibers.
Some brand tea bags no longer use paper, instead of plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the researchers' object of testing.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, and the researchers defined these microplastics in sizes ranging from 100 nm to 5 cm, generated mainly by the decomposition of plastic garbage.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest sea gorges around the world, which can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first found plastic particles in human fecal samples in several countries across the globe.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released in tea bags, the Canadian research team placed cranberries in contaminated water and found that microplastics could affect the behavior of these cranberries and cause them to develop developmental malformations.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that the consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what effects they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that these tea bags release large amounts of plastic particles, which may be due to the plastic tea bags being exposed to boiling water, and that they may break down or leak toxic substances even when “eat-grade” plastics are heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island nations.
There, a natural disaster will erode the development of a generation.
This is illustrated by the disasters in Barbuda, Dominica and the Bahamas, which have been hit by hurricanes since this year.
Approximately a quarter of people in small island developing countries live at sea level 5 meters or lower.
Relocations can seriously affect their social and lifestyle, and even raise questions about sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island nations joined forces to carbon-neutral and 100% renewable energy by 2030, once again leading the world in the right direction.
Guterres said: “The climate crisis is accumulating new injustice over the old.
Although small island developing countries have contributed little to global warming, they have paid the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act and it is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing countries.”
Today’s high-level conference adopted a political declaration calling for efforts to help small island developing countries manage disaster risks, invest in climate-adaptable infrastructure and approaches to the transition to renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing countries, especially debt-stricken middle-income countries, gain funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the life line of the Earth—the oceans.
The latest special report, released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, confirms that the oceans have already suffered the “sweeping” severe consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, there will likely be some extreme sea level rise every year in many regions that would only occur once in a century.
The report warns that some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable without large investments in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and oxidation have caused huge losses.
In the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the past 40 years.
Demand from industry, shipping, mining and tourism is leading to resource shrinkage, including fisheries that maintain many island communities.
Small island countries also face high transport, energy and infrastructure costs.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets, making them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security impacts of illicit trafficking in people, weapons and drugs.
Guterres said: “The problem can be solved anywhere by solving a problem in the most challenging environment.
The efforts of small island developing countries to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons and examples that can be drawn from around the world.”
Small island developing countries are exceptional examples of sustainable development.
They require long-term attention and investment from the entire international community.
The Indian Ministry of Finance says the financial system is liquid enough.
India's finance minister, Sitaraman, said on Monday that the current liquidity of the financial system is sufficient, and the growth rate of the Indian economy is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year, driven by the demand of the festival consumers.
The statement was made after meeting with representatives of private banks, non-bank financial institutions, housing banks and other institutions.
Westallaman did not specify the objectivity of these statements.
Previously, some Indian and overseas media blamed the ongoing slowdown in India’s current economy on liquidity tensions in non-bank financial institutions.
Westallaman took the fall in automotive sales as an example, denying that liquidity tensions were the main cause of the fall in sales.
Westallaman noted that the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Westallaman predicts that, driven by festive spending, India’s economic growth is likely to recover in the second half of the fiscal year.
India’s annual shopping season starts in September and will last until the end of the year.
Markets expect that shopping consumption will greatly boost India’s economic growth.
The Jiangxi Provincial Education Department recently issued a notice to strictly prohibit small and medium-sized schools throughout the province during the National Day holidays, and to randomly conduct random visits by organizers.

Implementation of maternal pig production, seriously implement the maternal pig subsidy policy, encourage pork breeding enterprises to expand the scale of pork breeding, and select excellent pork from the commodity pig group.
Taking care of hiring and financing implementation, the importance of hiring and financing of large domestic farming enterprises that have not yet entered our province is the main focus.
Implement the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of pork cold chain logistics facilities, and comprehensively promote the transition from "pork shifting" to "meat shifting".
To implement the modern vaccine prevention system, all areas should be equipped with grass-roots vaccine prevention and prevention personnel suitable for the scale and work tasks of breeding, and build the first line of defense for the prevention and control of vaccine diseases.
We must make every effort to safeguard the supply of the meat market, ensure that there is no large-scale shortage and large-scale supply cessation, and ensure that the supply of pork market is smooth and stable.
The meeting also deployed work on continuing to improve the prevention and control of African swine fever epidemics, the prohibition of catching in important waters in the River Basin, and the acquisition of late rice throughout the province.

Abe congratulated China on the 70th anniversary of its founding, and said the words in Chinese.
On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on the 70th anniversary of its founding.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good night, I am Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I wish to express my warm congratulations on behalf of the Government and the people of Japan.
At the G20 Summit in Osaka in June, the two countries of Japan and China cooperated to make the summit successful, and through the Declaration of the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Osaka, they declared to the world the firm will of the G20.
In addition, during the meeting and dinner before the summit, the two sides agreed that President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to Japan next spring, while being unanimously determined to open up a new era in China.
The two countries jointly assume a major responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that the two countries will work together to address the problems facing the region and the world, and contribute to the international community together, which will be beneficial for building a new model of future relations between the two countries.
Finally, I wish the Japan-China relationship to thrive and wish the business of my friends to prosper.
It is estimated that overage peasant workers on some workplaces account for more than half.
Where to find young workers?
There is no way to use so many "old people" on the workplace. "
Recently, for the phenomenon of the presence of a lot of aged peasant workers (over the retirement age) on the workplace, Zhou Qui, who has been a construction contractor for many years in the construction industry, regretted.
Recently, the university where I was conducting rain pollution discharge projects, there are a lot of peasant workers on the campus, if you watch carefully, you will find that there are a lot of aged peasant workers here.
Over-aged peasants are not out-of-workers, but because they can’t, because they have the power and hardship of having to do so—whether saving money to solve their retirement and medical problems, or helping their children, drives these old people who should have been out-of-working to continue to work hard.
The old-age peasant labourers' "old-do" are not as easy as we think.
Growing up children, caring for the elderly, helping children to study, helping children to build build buildings and buy cars, helping children to start a business, and raising grandchildren, when these peasant workers have completed their "life tasks", the money bags have been empty and even a lot of debt, most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to delay the children and to save some wealth for themselves, many peasant workers insisted on "working until dry."
Many "80s" and "90s" and even "00s" new generation of peasant workers are reluctant to engage in difficult conditions, high labor intensity secondary industries or low-end service industries, resulting in structural "employment poverty", these lack of attractive jobs, provide opportunities for aged peasant workers.
Due to the lack of a skill, physical function and labor capacity again decreased, many overage peasant workers are working with high intensity, low income, high risk, and less work.
Can work a day, can earn a little more, the survival difficulties of the aged peasant worker behind "can't go away", can not be ignored and ignored.
Resolving the problem of wages and wages, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor income, and improving the survival status of overage peasant workers, in addition to their “self-redemption”, is also inseparable from the institutional welfare and humanitarian care of the public sector.
Some scholars point out that older farmers are less likely to rely on their homes to solve problems such as retirement and medical care, and they have to support their families by other means.
Reading the helplessness and strength of the old-age peasant workers "cannot go away" helps us to better understand the love and pain of old-age peasant workers.
To see the back of the aged peasant workers, to hear their suspense, to figure out how to try to get back to the countryside they really realize the "old things", the public sector, the market and the society to share responsibility in the good interaction, the need for multilateral cooperation.
Chemesov said that Russia will not export such systems in the next five years, because “it will first supply its own military, and then export production.”
This approach is fully consistent with international practice.
Major producers of weapons and military equipment always first secure their own defense needs and then process export orders.
Earlier, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Force, General Yuri Grehov, said the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by Diamond-Antai Air Defense Corporation.
It is a new-generation air defense system that uses the working principle for destroying ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some sources, the S-500 can also destroy hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of drones, hypersonic missiles that are five times faster than the speed of sound, and even near-space targets.
These weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400, which is very important from a defense perspective.
Sergei Chmesov has expressed special concern for the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian military also needs it, including in the Arctic region.
The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to the news of September 15, the work of the New Zealand Arctic Air Defense Corps to modify the S-400 air defense missile system has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, this is purely a process within the transition plan for more advanced defense tools to the strategic direction of the north.
Russia's Northern Fleet news agency said: "With the transition to the new S-400 air defense system, the controlled airspace in the Arctic region has increased significantly."
Most importantly, according to the military assessment, the system has been used successfully in the far north and Arctic regions.
Air Defense Corps officers were trained for the new system and prepared for entry into combat service.
Previously, the S-300 long-range air defense system was equipped there, and now part of it is still preserved.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons that can destroy a variety of air targets, whether they are targets for high-speed flights outside or near the protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Gold Diamond-Antai Air Defense Corporation, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-speed hypersonic targets and other airstrike weapons.
The weapon is capable of attacking aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometers and of hitting ballistic targets flying at a speed of 4.8 kilometers per second within a range of 60 kilometers.
Russia has never hidden that it will supplement the deployment of air defense forces in the far north to ensure the airspace security of the Northern Sea Route.
Recently, the first 12 Tor-M2DT air defense missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic region, which were enough to form an air defense camp to strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic region.
At the time, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Arctic "Tor" forces will be expanded to complete brigade-level construction in the future.
Combined with the newly deployed S-400 long-range systems on New Zealand and the Korean Peninsula and the Pantsir-SA short-range systems deployed in the far north, these advanced air defense weapons are powerful in defending Russia’s polar sky.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will find it difficult to break through this defense.
According to the idea of the Russian government, the flagship store will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As an operator of Russian goods stores, the company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
All of China’s largest trading platforms including Tmall, JD, 1688 and Pinduoduo, Q (ShouQ), Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi (Wechat) have online stores and have their own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian retail chain stores.
The Russian Export Center will work with the company to develop a store marketing strategy and standards for participation, as well as to screen virtual shelf-on-shelf products.
The store is scheduled to open by the end of this year and will feature products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, China's e-commerce platform has a total of 1 billion monthly visits.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014 and have exceeded $1 billion in 2018.
Currently, Alibaba will also open a pilot store to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the global import strategy.
According to Alexei Khorevnikov, in the new store will be displayed the goods of companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher than 500 million rubles of sales are insignificant.
We all know that the attitude of Chinese consumers towards Russian goods is quite positive, and we view our goods as high-quality and green environmental products.
Khorevnikov said the competition between Chinese consumers, who compete for strong purchasing power, is fierce and is growing.
He said: “Our ambitious goal is to launch 500 through this store in three years.”
At the same time, the platform will also feature products from Russian companies in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor of trade policy at the Plekhanov University of Economics in Russia, said: “This is a political project representing the image of both sides, because Russia’s export centers are state-owned and not private institutions.”
“I don’t see a large number of highly competitive Russian products in the market.”
He said the project is unlikely to be really implemented, but it will help to strengthen the relations between the two countries.
Andrew Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that product information about more than 170 Russian companies has been posted on the largest international wholesale online platform Alibaba.com, which can be purchased in China and elsewhere.
In addition, there is a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training programme for Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
At the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November this year, the Russian Export Center will also serve as the organizer of Russian enterprises participating in industry exhibitions and business projects.
A large exhibition will be held in the 1000-square-meter exhibition hall, which will also serve as a center for the holding of business project events, agreement signing ceremonies, presentation sessions and meetings with representatives of Chinese enterprises.
About 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
The Russian Export Center news office said: "In addition to the agricultural exhibition, we will hold business conferences, i.e. arrange for direct contacts between entrepreneurs."
“This is another direction of our efforts, with the aim of supporting and ensuring dozens of dedicated meetings are scheduled for them.”
In addition, the exhibition will host master classes, cooking competitions and the Russian cuisine exhibition of Russian chefs in the "Explore the Shanghai Station of Russian Cuisine" project.

New Year's Eve: We are determined to follow our own path.
The White Paper on China and the World in the New Era, published on 27 December, answered: "In the past 70 years, China's development has been successful, and the fundamental reason is that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the correct development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed this path.
China’s path of development is the choice of history and the choice of the people.
Since modern times, in the environment of accumulated poverty and weakness and internal distress, a generation of benevolent volunteers have sought and succeeded on the path to search for the rescue of the country.
The monarchy, the constitutional system, the restoration of the imperial system, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, the presidential system have been thought of and tried, and the results will not work.
Until with the Communist Party of China, with the New China, the Chinese people gradually opened up a road of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
This road is the road of happiness for the Chinese people, the road of rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, and the road of common development between China and the world.
It is because China is on the right path that it can do its own things well, that it can become the world's second-largest economy, the country that contributes the most to global economic growth, that it can continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the White Paper, China's development path, in line with China's national conditions and adapted to the requirements of the times, will show more and more bright development prospects with the advancement of the times.
Looking back at the past, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people value this right path even more.
The Chinese understand the reason for the northern orange, and understand that suitable for others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, only suitable for themselves is the best.
It is with this road of self-confidence and strategic determination that China has created remarkable miracles.
In the twisting process of mankind's advance, the "historical conclusion theory" was once named.
Today, the success of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the “historic conclusion theory”, the collapse of the “Chinese collapse theory”, and the failure of the “socialist failure theory”.
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving the strength of the wealthy people, expanded the path of modernization in developing countries, and provided experience and learnings for countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate their development and want to maintain their independence, to follow the path in line with their own national conditions.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose the development path suitable to their national conditions.
China will not "import" foreign models, nor "export" the Chinese model, but will resolutely follow its own path, its own continuous development, strengthen governance and exchanges with other countries, and make the appropriate contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a Foodworks supermarket owner fired a 66-year-old worker by texting a text message because he preferred to hire an employee from an Asian background, whose practice was sharply criticized as “shameful.”
The committee said that Mr. Gail Ayton’s owner, Jianbin Wang, who worked at Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, treated employees “extremely unfairly” and may have violated anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and that he had always “wanted to fired me” because she wasn’t Chinese.
In the case, Commission Vice-President Peter Sams conducted a search on the Internet and found “some of Mr. Wang’s recruitment ads in the past posted on various Australian Chinese employment forums.”
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one says “Preferred Asian Ladies” and the other says “Preferred Asian Employees.”
The third post said that he was “more inclined to overseas people (as the original text does).”
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton through a text message in April, later saying it was due to her absence and the alleged shortage of a small amount of cash from $5.10 to $30.
But Mr. Sams said Mr. Wang’s reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lack of evidence.
In the past three years, she has only missed one assignment, and the "missing amount" totaled a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton was fired “not actually related to her behavior or performance.”
He said: “In my opinion, supported by evidence from Mr. Wang’s hiring ads, the real motivation for her to be fired by the lawyer was that he preferred to hire employees with an Asian background.
In accordance with Article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang’s conduct appears to be illegal in violation of anti-discrimination laws and/or dismissal of applicants.
Mr. Sams said it was inappropriate for him to consider restoring her position, given Mr. Wang’s “horrible hearing” of Ms. Ayton.
He should consider paying damages to Ms. Ayton, who is a temporary worker with an hourly salary of $26.
Given possible violations of anti-discrimination and labor legislation, Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the committee to consider whether Mr. Wang’s actions should be referred to other agencies to investigate possible violations of state or federal laws.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any chance to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said: “I think the defendant has taken irreversible unfair and biased procedures to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang “waits” for this opportunity, which he believes will “prove” that the termination of the employment of the applicant is justified.”
“He was wrong ... ... that the lawyer should completely disregard any natural and fair treatment given to her when dismissing the applicant, and it is shocking that his disrespectful and extremely unfair acts of hypocrisy.”
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, “it must be frankly said that no honest employer will dismiss employees in the extremely unfair and perverted manner recognized in this case.”
He said, “This is shameful and extremely unfair.”

Vietnam must seize the opportunity to develop artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities’ level of preparedness for the AI wave include prospects, achievement capabilities, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is ranked first, followed by cities in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
In an interview with reporters, Oliver Wyman said: “I find it very meaningful to review and evaluate cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
Overall, I think the future of Vietnam is very bright in the context of high growth rate, strong economic development path, and rapid development of the talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track and has done well.
It is important for Vietnam to know how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to drive further economic development.”
Artificial intelligence is completely changing the way people work, communicate and live.
It brings greater efficiency, but also threatens to exacerbate social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, the only cities in the world today are prepared for the breakthroughs of the AI era.

Approximately 800 million people on National Day trips offset China's tourism supply demand
Approximately 800 million people will travel in the upcoming “11th” Golden Week!
The big data of several tourism platforms shows that the supply and demand of China's tourism consumer market has prospered.
The National Day Tourism Report predicts that, according to the statistics of national holiday tourism in the past year, it is expected that this year's National Day holiday will be close to 800 million domestic tourists; there will also be more than 7.5 million outbound travel.
Currently, there are tourists from more than 500 cities through the platform to book and organize group trips, free trips, custom trips, local entertainment and other products, involving 100 countries and regions.
According to the Chinese Institute of Tourism Research estimates, last year's National Day holiday received a total of 7.2 billion domestic tourists nationwide, an increase of 9.43%.
This year's National Day holiday will not only increase the number of tourists, but the upgrading of consumption will also become the "main melody" of the National Day holiday.
National Day holiday domestic cross-provincial tourists spend more than 3,000 yuan per capita, more than in the same period of last year, because tourists generally choose to experience better products, such as high-rated brand hotels, no shopping tour groups, sophisticated groups, specialty guides and so on.
The reservation data shows a similar trend, the use of comfortable models and "private enjoyment groups" with less than ten people throughout the long run in the country is more popular than in previous years.
Spring and autumn tourism data show that its consumers prefer heavy experience, heavy service, and heavy differentiation of "sustainable slow".
Flying pig data shows that the number of tourist reservations in China's fourth line and lower cities has grown the fastest, and the growth rate has reached 30%, reflecting the consumption and upgrading of residents in more regions in the country.
Personalization is a major feature of this year's "11" Golden Week tourism.
Travel data show that National Day holiday car rental self-driving orders are expected to grow by 60% compared to the same time, short-distance self-driving tours in the surrounding township continues to be popular; the number of registrations of private groups has increased by up to 155%.
Sharing joy has become the main purpose of people’s leisure travel.
Travel data show that 28% of National Day holiday visitors are family and children, 25% are couples and 23% are colleagues and friends.
In terms of the age of tourists, “after 80” and “after 90” account for more than 50 percent of the total number of tourists.
It is worth noting that the more rapid growth in overseas travel is different from the previous Golden Week, and this year the domestic tourism market performs more "at the eye".
Flying pig data shows that the number of people booking domestic tour routes for the National Day holiday this year increased by 42% in comparison, increasing faster than outbound trips.
Industry analysis, at the same time that demand is strong, the tourism supply-side reform is promoted across the country, providing tourists with a richer "cultural tourism prosperity".

The world's oldest hairdresser died at the age of 108 years after cutting his hair for 96 years
In New York, the world's oldest barber, Anthony Mancinelli, has a Kings World Record certified, 108 years old, who has never retired daily hardworking for guest hair, but Mancinelli died on the 19th of complications of cancer, farewell to his 96 years of haircut life.
According to CNN, Mancini immigrated to the United States at the age of eight, soon in a barber shop to help clean the floor, and at the age of 12 began to pick up cutting knives for guests, thereby alleviating the economic pressure in the home.
Mancini went to primary school at the time, but did not graduate.
Mancinelli's son Robert (Robert) revealed that his father loved work, and people from all over the world liked him, but his father, although he was always healthy, was diagnosed with cancer in February this year, and 6 weeks before his death finally could not go to work because of physical factors, but this is not retirement, because he planned to wait for himself to recover and have his hair cut back.
Robert, 82, said he had to find a new barber after his father died, because he had been helping his father to cut his hair all his life.
In the year, listed companies re-acquired more than 100 billion yuan at a historic high.
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the company's image, the listed company has begun to frequently buy back shares in the past two years, through directed repurchase, collective bid transactions, and so on, hoping to transmit the company's value is undervalued this information to the market, thereby stabilizing the share price, and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern Wealth Choice data showed that in 2017 listed companies used to buy back shares of funds of 7.9 billion yuan, in 2018 sharply increased to 51.1 billion yuan, since 2019, the total amount of A-share listed companies to buy back and implement has exceeded 100 billion yuan, making A-share to buy back the new high, and far exceeds the previous year.
From the point of view of the purpose of the repurchase, the company's repurchase of shares appears to be the same as the major shareholder's increase, but there are great differences in the implementation of the subject, the source of funds, the use of repurchase, and the equity itself.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Mykolong Information Consulting Limited Responsibility Company, said in an interview with the "Securities Daily" reporter that in November 2018 the "Opinions on supporting the repurchase of shares of listed companies" was issued, addressing the narrow scope of share repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures, insufficient inventory system and other existing system problems, because the previous policy has begun to encourage the listed company to repurchase shares, so that year the repurchase of shares phenomenon has increased significantly.
In January of this year, the listed companies have officially issued the "Rules for the implementation of the purchase of shares of listed companies", which has expanded the sources of funds for the purchase of funds of listed companies, appropriately simplified the implementation procedures, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee holding plans.
After the opinion was issued, the operation of the stock repurchase of the listed company has more suitability, the repurchase process is simpler, and the enthusiasm for the repurchase of shares is also greater.
Buying back shares at a relatively low position also helps listed companies to improve the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the level of profit per share, improving the net asset return rate, and alleviating the pressure on the company's profit indicators.
Compared to large shareholders, the significance of the return purchase of shares of listed companies is greater, and it also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market value and the abundance of cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the underestimated share price is the main factor in the re-purchase of listed companies, the company's share price can no longer reflect the company's future development prospects, so such companies are worthy of investor attention, but cannot blindly invest, and need to pay attention to such listed companies' profits and specific operating conditions.
The listed companies with massive repurchase behavior show at least the company's confidence in the development and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for the repurchase of A-share listed companies has gradually warmed up, and also normalized the repurchase behavior, the data showed that almost a thousand listed companies have implemented share repurchase this year, and the leading companies in various industries have become the main force in the repurchase market.
The company has cumulatively repurchased 5.759 million shares of A-shares through centralized auction trading method, accounting for 0.315% of the total share capital of the company, the total amount of funds paid totaled 5 billion yuan (not including transaction fees), the repurchased shares will be all used for the employee holding plan, including but not limited to the long-term service plan approved by the company's shareholders' assembly.
Ely shares have paid 57,92 billion yuan to buy back shares, and have recently adjusted the use of buy back shares, changing from the original planned "buy back shares will all be used as a source of shares for the implementation of equity incentives later on" to "cumulative buy back 1,83 billion shares, of which 1.5 billion shares will be used for the implementation of equity incentives and the remaining 30.4 million shares will be used for cancellation to reduce registered capital."
Eli shares said that the cancellation of some of the shares that have been repurchased is conducive to further raising the level of earnings per share and effectively improving the return on investment for the company's shareholders.
TCL Group announced on September 25th that the TCL Group cumulatively bought back 3.59% of the company's shares, with a total cost of 16.5 billion yuan.
The TCL Group’s board of directors said that the repurchase of shares would be used for employee holding plans, equity incentives, or for the conversion of company bonds issued by listed companies that can be converted into shares.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improving competitiveness and sustained healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the maintenance of the interests of investors, combined with the performance of the company's shares in the secondary market in the past year, and comprehensive consideration of the company's operating situation and financial situation, the company plans to use own funds, self-funding funds and other ways to raise funds to buy back the company's shares.
Yang DeLong, chief economist of the Open Source Fund, said that the operation of the listed company to buy back shares, on the one hand, can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market, increase the earnings per share of the listed company, is an important advantage for the share price of the secondary market; In addition, the listed company is willing to take out real gold and silver, and buy back shares from the stock market, which greatly boosts market confidence.
Acquisition of domestic listed companies has gradually increased in recent years, especially the performance of equities, which is a very good way to boost the confidence of investors through share repurchase, and is also a practice worth affirming and encouraging.
Hunan Provincial Committee Standing Committee, Yangtze Municipal Committee Secretary Hu Huang Huang Huang and Engineering Machinery Manufacturing Huang Army four major doors - Jiang Zhen, Liang, Huang Qing, Liu Fian, around "long sand from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing" set a "small goal" - three to five years later to create the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster.
In Yangtze to create the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster, using the current fashion word, is to create "the strongest surface".
As an inland province city, Nagasaki shouted this loud word, where did the air come from?
It is due to the power of hegemony.
The four engineering machinery SHU enterprises that participated in the dialogue, each in hand, covered the whole field of the sky, underground, sea and land: mountain river intelligent light aircraft, concrete transportation pump of China Union Heavy Industries, three-one-heavy ground lifting machine, iron-building heavy construction tunnel shielding machine, its "hard power" can be said to be unique in the sky, arrogant group.
Once upon a time, China has basically no right of speech in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
China enterprises "introduce" and "go out" dual-wheel drive, take the "One Belt and One Road" initiative's east wind, acquisition, merger, establishment of factories and other measures, a leap into the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the leading enterprises in engineering machinery such as Tsinghua Heavy Industries, China Union Heavy Industries, Iron Construction Heavy Industries, Mountain River Intelligence, and other major economic indicators such as output value, market share, sales, have significantly led the same type of enterprises.
Time is controlled by the camera.
Engineering machinery Xi'an "Four Great King Kong", is the leader of the Hangzhou engineering machinery industry cluster, and is also the head enterprise of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the river of global industry, who can survive and live well, is the hardness of speech.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry encountered the cold winter, a lot of internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen, but the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises of Yangtshu took the "winter swim" as "winter swim", self-improve pressure, self-breakthrough, through industrial structure transformation, from manufacturing to intellectual transformation, not only to stand up to the past, but also to the body more strong.
And the stars of the moon.
The development of advanced industries requires both the active promotion of enterprises and the active action of the government.
The reputation of the "city of engineering machinery" is that the entire industrial chain from the upstream to the downstream has been brought together, many related industrial clusters have been created, and through the optimization of the business environment, the improvement of supporting services, the simplification of the approval process, the development, manufacturing and sales costs of enterprises have been greatly reduced.
Good business ecology, allowing engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to come.
History has pushed Yangtze to the forefront of creating the world's leading level of engineering machinery, when I am not, when Yin is not.
Both the government, the enterprise, and even the related industrial and research enterprises, should seize the opportunity, move forward, set goals, continue to make efforts, and contribute Hunan strength to the construction of a manufacturing power.

Shawley has been raising sheep for 20 years, until the cooperative works, he knows how widespread sheep have been in the past.
Haveli is a villager from Shenyang Province's Shenyang Town Shenyang Village.
His left-hand neighbors are shepherds, but adhere to the traditional breeding method, sheep are of poor quality, and the output is small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined cooperatives, and everything began to change.
Shawley spent the whole day studying breeding, because he was constantly breathing.
The shareholders are poor households, they all keep the sheep to the cooperative, whether they can divide and sell at the end of the year, but they are expecting him.
In order to have the guidance of technical personnel, he slowly learned to engage in disease prevention, mastered scientific feeding, and became the "good style" of cultivation for the few in the village.
The specialized cooperative for farming is a standardized cooperative with a total of 16 shepherds and 1,400 lake sheep.
Zhou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that there is a good way outside of the standardized shepherd shed.
"The sheep's wool is thick, it is easy to breed bacteria, the lake sheep cannot be kept in hot and humid places, the sheep shed must be built in three-faceted gaps, and the ventilator must be installed to ventilate the heat."
Zhou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, it is also necessary to regularly disinfect the sheep shed with a spray, and to the sheep three to four times in a quarter.
In addition to living well, the "small fat sheep" must also eat grasses mixed with corn, wheat, oatmeal, etc., and have sufficiently wide "playing fields" to expand the muscle.
The cooperatives adopted the method of custody and substitution, guiding local farmers to put good species of lake sheep here, unify breeding, management, and sales, and good cultivation, scientific, standardized, and intensive cultivation.
Nowadays, 140 poor households with sheep shareholdings, each household dividends more than 6,000 yuan annually, there are four people who have built a poverty alleviation card to work in cooperatives.
From "full mountain pasture" to "precision feeding", from "local mate" to "artificial fertilization", from "looking body, touching the belly" to "being done B super" ... ... in Gansu, sheep breeding is not only a shift in the way of feeding, "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" model has also changed the scenario of once "having sheep on the slopes, selling sheep in the market", overcoming the weak scattering of traditional agriculture, farmers' poor days because of modern sheep breeding become better.
Zhou Tao said that if market prices are weak, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhejiang Shaanxi Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. will buy at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram, helping farmers to diversify market risks.
Xu Jiang Feng, general adviser to Zhenjiang Zhenjiang Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd., said that enterprises are driving more and more poor households by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, bid acquisitions, unified processing sales and other services.
At least 8,200 poor households have achieved a stable increase in income through the breeding of crops, good breed breeding, scale breeding, slaughter division, and market sales.
The city is located in the northern agricultural crossing zone and has rich grass resources.
At present, the city has 913 scaled sheep farms, cooperatives, more than 5 million sheep, has also built two 1.3 million sheep slaughter scale processing production lines, sheep are becoming the local industry poverty alleviation "leading sheep".
French finance ministers say they will cut taxes by more than €10 billion next year and urge Germany to follow up
PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France will cut taxes by more than €10 billion ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep up with France's fiscal stimulus to revive a sluggish economy.
In introducing France’s 2020 budget, Le Maire said the European Central Bank’s latest monetary easing initiative created an opportunity for the governments of those members with capacity to increase investments.
The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates to a record low on September 12 and plans to resume debt purchases to lower borrowing costs, hoping to boost economic recovery and boost inflation.
“Low interest rates will not restore prosperity to Europe, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough,” Le Maire told reporters.
“Germany needs to invest and needs it now, and the sooner the better. don’t wait until the situation gets worse,” he added.
He has repeatedly appealed to Germany.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than €10 billion this year, a major boost to French economic growth.
The global economy is losing momentum, and the German economy depends on exports.
Le Maire noted that the tax burden for French families will be reduced by 9.3 billion euros next year, including 5 billion euros in income tax deductions.
In addition, as the corporate tax rate will be gradually reduced from 33.3% to 25% over a five-year period, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by €1 billion.

U.S. National Health Nutrition Index Grows Small But Still Challenges
According to the U.S. Chinese News Network, a recent study in the United States showed that in the past 16 years, the U.S. government's healthy diet index has grown moderately, from 56 to 58.
But in the case of a full score of 100 points, it is not worth celebrating.
Americans still face “significant challenges” in nutrition.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Feng, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said Americans still consume too much food that could cause diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, which are the most common diseases affected by American citizens.
The study was published on 24th in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study is based on the conclusions of health surveys conducted by the U.S. government on 44,000 adults between 1999 and 2016.
The authors wrote, “Dimensional dietary challenges persist despite significant improvements.”
These challenges include reducing the American population’s consumption of foods containing saturated fats such as snacks, hot dogs, fat cows, butter.
The study found that people’s daily intake of these unhealthy fats increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% upper limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet is the reduction of sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but the intake is still too high.
It is officially believed that in the daily diet, the amount of added sugar should be less than 10%.
For the reason for the reduction in sugar intake, the researchers thought it was linked to the reduction in people’s drinking of sweet soda, but Zhang emphasized that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
U.S. adults have seen a slight increase in the intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole-grain foods.
However, the 2016 data showed that the share of these foods in the daily diet is still less than 5%.
Although people have slightly reduced their intake of salt, and a decrease in their drinking juice has led to low-quality carbohydrate intake, Zhang said they still account for up to 42% of their daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined cereals.
The study was based on an individual health survey every two years, which allowed adults to remember what foods they had eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The government-issued U.S. resident dietary guidelines recommend that people adopt “healthy eating patterns” to reduce the likelihood of developing chronic diseases.
The guidelines point out that people should consume more nutrition-intensive foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs and seed-like foods that can provide protein.
During the survey, the number of people with diabetes in the United States almost doubled, more than 7%, and the obesity rate has also increased over the years between the survey — and now about 70% of American adults are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the leading cause of death for American citizens.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
The members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee and Minister of Economy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguyen Wenping, attended the forum.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the forum is “Connecting the EU with Asia: Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future”.
The forum was held a year after the implementation of the linkage strategy on the two continents of the European Union.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that strengthening connectivity is part of the proposal, as it benefits the people and economies of the countries concerned.
These relations contribute to stability and prosperity for all parties concerned.
At the same time, he believes that the EU wants to convey a message about increasing participation and strengthening mutually beneficial relations between Europe and Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is the special guest of the forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
The country's first equity management and financial subsidiary established with technology and capability to manage business
On the 26th, the full-funded subsidiary of Guangdong Bank, Guangdong Capital Limited Liability Company, was formally established in Qingdao, which is the first joint-stock banking subsidiary established in China.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial science and technology, and the establishment of a subsidiary of the bank is conducive to its use of scientific and technological means to enhance the management of business.
In April of this year, Shenzhen Bank and Chief Commercial Bank issued an announcement that they had been approved by the China Bank Insurance Regulatory Council to prepare for the establishment of a subsidiary.
On September 24, the Bank of China announced that the Bank of China has been officially authorized to open its business.
Just two days later, the light bank led a number of stock banks, leading the first in Qingdao to establish light funds.
Li Xiaoping, chairman of the Group, said that the Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern scientific and technological thinking and means, rely on big data, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, improve the coverage rate, usage rate and penetration rate of financial capital, and improve the customer's sense of acquisition, happiness and security.
By 2021, the four and eight pillars of China's financial and technological development should be established to further enhance the financial and technological application capabilities, deep integration and coordinated development of finance and science, and significantly enhance the satisfaction of the people with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Huang, Chairman of the Joint Chief Financial Officer, introduced that the Joint Chief Financial Officer platform of Joint Chief Financial Officer will use intelligent consultation, intelligent research and research, big data and other technologies to help Joint Chief Financial Officer better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, new technologies such as blockchain will also be applied to grasp the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
Jing Xiao, a special researcher at the National Finance and Development Laboratory, said that under the new competitive situation facing the capital industry, financial technology companies and controlled institutions will jointly explore new growth paths using capital science and technology.
Financial and technological empowerment of the management industry is both the need for the transformation of financial and technological development itself, and will inject new vitality and vitality for the development of the management business.
At the beginning of this year, Qingdao Digital Science and Technology launched a new headquarters science and technology system, using technology and digital means to enhance headquarters' product research and development and wind control capabilities.
The new system comes from the four main capabilities of product design, sales transactions, asset management and risk assessment to improve the overall intelligent operating level of the management industry.
Experts believe that management technology in improving customer service capabilities and innovative and enriching products, can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve management efficiency.
Zhang Huang said that in the past through survey questionnaires to position customers' risk preferences are likely to deviate, and now using artificial intelligence to make user images, helps to better position customers, according to the customer's investment preferences to launch the corresponding products, helps to eliminate the risk.
“Alternative big data such as e-commerce, time and space data can help us better mapping a region, an industry’s activity, and economics.”
Zhang Huang said that while eliminating risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
China's deepest railway tunnel tower recorded
After more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the building of the Great Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Railway Rail.
The 34.5 km long Railway Tunnel in Yunnan is the longest double-line single-hole tunnel in Asia, crossing the Highland Mountains from the West Bank of Yangtze River.
The tunnel crossing 19 ruptured bands with a maximum buried depth of 1155 meters, because it covers almost all of the tunnel construction could encounter adverse geology and major risks, is known as the "geological museum" for the construction of the High Ridge Mountain Tunnel.
The hanging well is the most important auxiliary pitway in the High Ridge Mountain Tunnel, and it carries an important task of increasing the operational surface to the "long tunnel short" and late-term railway operation ventilation.
The 1st erection well has been successfully excavated to the bottom of the well, which marks the official entry of the High Régon Mountain tunnel into the level tunnel construction, and after the excavation and replacement of the underground equipment, the well can add 4 operating surfaces to speed up the excavation speed of the tunnel hole.
"The well is all in the ground layer of the grassroots, because the grassroots layer of the grassroots has more cracks, can not stop the water, from top to bottom flow continuously, basically how deep the water pressure is."
The general engineer of the railway project department of the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau of Drai Railway told reporters that during the construction of the well, there were several storms, crashes and other dangerous situations, and the construction party invited experts to discuss the solution more than 20 times.
"When the maximum flow of water in the wells, more than 300 cubic meters per hour, more than 700 meters deep wells, the water pressure is equivalent to 700 meters deep sea floor."
If the drainage is not pumped in time, one hour will flood 10 meters of well, we spend almost 85% of the time cleaning and 15% of the time digging.
In order to overcome the geological difficulties such as the vertical conservation of the development of the No. 1 fountains, the flowing water, the water-rich grassroots, the construction of the tunnel uses the combination of systemic water treatment measures to reduce the construction risk.
After several improvements, the construction of the 1st fountain formed the excavation system, the excavation system, the suspension system, the hanging system and other mechanized flow lines, and achieved the full process of mechanization, such as eye, explosion, excavation, template installation, concrete irrigation, and accelerated the construction progress.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 days and nights of construction, the excavation was successfully completed at a depth of 762,59 meters.
The total length of the railway is 330 kilometers, is an important part of the China-Myanmar international passageway, and is an important transportation infrastructure for the implementation of the "Belt and Road" construction.
After the construction of the bus, the driving time from Delhi to Riyadh will be shortened from 6 hours of the current road to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western region, and will play a role in promoting China's economic and trade cooperation and friendly exchanges with Southeast Asian countries.

"Eleven" long holiday consumption small survey: choosing more diversified tourism occupies the first place.
National Day holidays are approaching, and people's holiday plans are gradually fixed.
The "Securities Daily" reporter recently launched a small survey on the "Eleven" holiday arrangements in the circle of friends, and 20 feedback received showed that although everyone's plans are different, "tourism + consumption" has become the key word for the "Eleven" holiday.
Specifically, in the feedback received by the “Securities Daily” journalists, the majority of people chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Tianjin, said, "The 11th" planned to travel with his family to Shanghai, Disney was the first stop, and then to the surrounding city, "; Mrs. Li in Beijing chose to travel to Taiwan, "A family of three departed on September 28th, plans to tour the island for ten days "; Ms. Ma in Chongqing planned to go abroad, the destination is Singapore; Mr. Zhang in Hebei family chose to drive by itself, he said "the daughter is less than two years old, outdoors are not very convenient, plans to drive to Shandong, play a few days at the sea."
The 2019 National Day Golden Week Travel and Travel Trends Report, released in conjunction with tourism, shows that this year's National Day Golden Week travel and travel consumption upgrading trend in the three segments of travel, living and travel is obvious.
The penetration rate of aircraft and high-speed rail travel has steadily increased, and the demand for star-class hotels and personalized non-targeted accommodation has increased.
On September 23, the "2019 National Day Tourism Consumption Trends Report" released by the US League showed that tourism consumption continued to flourish and showed a diversified and upgraded trend of "eat and play".
More young people travel in favor of high-quality, distinctive experiences, cultural tourism, night tourism and other heat continues to rise.
In addition to tourism, all kinds of consumer needs are also concentrated during the "11th" period.
Mr. Wang, who lives in Chengdu, told the Securities Daily reporter, “This year’s ‘11th’ main plan is to buy a car.”
The staff of a Beijing automobile brand 4S store told the "Securities Daily" reporter, in general, September and October of each year is known as the golden period of car sales.
During the "Eleventh" period, the store will launch a number of activities, such as the draw, the store reduction and so on.
In addition, many brands have recently launched new models, and the boost effect of new products on sales is expected to be more obvious.
Under the trend of upgrading consumption, people attach more importance to the satisfaction of needs at the spiritual level, and the share of services such as culture and education consumption continues to increase.
Ms. Du, who lives in Beijing, said, “Since the birth of the child, culture and education consumption has become the head of household consumption spending.
This year's "Eleven" ranks are full of days, to go to the "play card" astronomy, children's theater, about a few family weekends to go to the caterpillar museum to camp in tents, and also arrange some test listening experience lessons. "
Theoretically, the evolution path of residents' consumption upgrading is from survival consumption to developmental consumption and enjoyment consumption, in which a considerable part of the content of enjoyment consumption is the category of service consumption.
With the continuous development of China's economic society and the rising income level of residents, people are increasingly paying attention to the consumption needs of the spiritual level, tourism and travel is a good way.
In particular, to catch up with the "11th" National Day holiday, the time is more abundant, people are more willing to travel and consume, which can meet both the consumption needs of the spiritual level, and is the reflection of the upgrading of resident consumption.
Afternoon begins lonely, not willing to go out, has not adjusted the condition of the children are not around.
Attention and say to the dog Nana: “Mom takes you out.”
Detailedly written out several things to do, the character characteristics of blood type A are becoming more and more tough, and they feel very different.
Take clothes, buy nutritious grains, pay, buy raw fish, nanna small snacks.
This is the reason for leaving.
In the phone, I just had Nana thanks to my sister's love, otherwise there was no excuse to buy a small snack.
He laughed a few times and said the child was hanging off when the phone came.
Nana slightly jumped to the assistant's desk, honestly lay down, she knew that she was fainting, frightened, and not willing to accompany me.
Her husband, Boo, came back very early.
Even admire the salad made with sandwiches and beef, and then go to the bedroom lying in bed and watching TV.
Looking at the wall, it was just seven o’clock, the country of sunrise too early, the sky was already dark.
In the circle of friends all invented the moon, and today is Mid-Autumn.
He washed a series of grapes sent by a friend, left half to Boo, and the rest was placed in his favorite small flower bowl, and went out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and I ate the grapes, and she ate the skins, and I poured the seeds of the grapes with strength far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, so that in the clouds it walks, and the moon suddenly appears, and suddenly shrinks.
There are various poems about the moon in the head, but I just clearly like this phrase: every three-fifth reunion / full of the clear-light gardens / only a round in the sky / the people of the world look up.
Per we have given too many emotions to the moon, for the present I say, in fact, that word of God to God, Caesar to Caesar is the best.

Chinese students will be able to apply for German undergraduates next year.
Recently, the German database of Anabin, which is responsible for evaluating accreditation of foreign academic qualifications, announced on its website: Starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly to German universities based on high school scores, without having to first register for entry to domestic universities.
Prior to this, Chinese high school graduates who wish to apply to German universities would need to study for one semester at a domestic undergraduate university (211,985 universities) or three semesters (generic undergraduate) and pass the APS audit or TestAS exam.
The new rules will save at least six months for Chinese students willing to study in Germany.
It is that the new rules will enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants must meet the following requirements: completion of 12 years of formal obligatory education, obtaining a high school diploma; participation in examinations, high school exams, and high school exams score of 70% or more (if the total score is 750, it must be more than 525 points), and which includes two language scores and one math or natural sciences scores.
In addition, the specific professional requirements for high school results are different.
For example, applying for medicine, oral medicine classes, veterinary medicine, pharmacy and other specialties, the high school exam score must reach 80% of the full scores, and the high school exam subjects must include at least two in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or participate in the review; applying for the legal class, the high school exam score must reach 80% of the full scores, and the high school exam subjects must include at least two in foreign languages, history, geography, or participate in the review.
According to incomplete statistics, there are currently several countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and others that recognize China's high school exams.
Take the UK for example, University of Cambridge, University of Birmingham, University of Leicester and other universities, all accept Chinese scholars with a high school exam score application for enrollment.

Would Marguerite be elected to the Danish Parliament Assembly?
General Chairman of Mawar Nasr Sri Weihang: “Take the Supreme Council of the National Front to discuss!”
The Supplementary General Assembly of Danubio Beirut is concerned about whether the party's member Party of Mawar is in the position of this traditional seat.
However, after the meeting of the Mao China Committee, it was announced that it would be handed over to the Supreme Council of the National Front to decide whether the traditional Mao Assembly seat would continue to be handed over by Mao or replaced by other member parties.
After presiding over the meeting of the Mao China Committee on Thursday afternoon, Wei said to the media that any supplementary election will be conducted according to the standard operational procedure (SOP), i.e. after a meeting of the supreme council of the Mao will be decided.
He said that because the election committee will meet next Monday (1st) to determine the issue of the Danu'i's seat in the country, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Party is expected to be held in early October.
“Yesterday morning I also met with the leader of the party, Nazarbayev, and we all agreed that we must regain this seat in the hands of the coalition.”
“We are scheduled to convene a special meeting of the leaders of the National Front in early October, where the leaders of the National Front will determine which member party will be in charge.”
Asked whether Mao would adhere to this traditional seat in the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei Jin reiterated that he, as Mao's president, must act in accordance with the standard operational procedures, so any decision must be reached by the consensus of the National Front.
"In any subsequent election, someone is willing to march, there are political parties, and somehow they think they should go out, this is an ordinary thing."
“The most important thing is which organization and political coalition we come from?”
“It’s a big test for our political coalition over the years, and we believe the Front has come along with some precious values.”
“Maybe someone will say something in the process, which is strange.”
“But once the Supreme Council of the National Front has made a decision, everyone must be fully prepared for war, which is the most precious thing.”
In any case, Wei Xiaobo said that Mao will prepare for the upcoming Danfeng Biao'i National Supplementary Election at three levels, namely the District Council, the State Joint Committee and the Central Committee.
“The district council will be led by the (Danu Piauí) district council chairman Nasr Shri Yoon Li; the state joint committee will be led by the chairman of the Joint Commission of Jiu Jiu; as for the central council, it will be deployed by the chairman of the general council Nasr Mahan and the secretary-general Nasr Zhang personally.”
Last Saturday (21), Indigenous Solidarity Party member of the National Assembly Deng Baeyeon Nasr Mohammad Ali died of heart problems at the Government Hospital of Bujarin at the age of 42.
A villager in Hubei Bay County hunting wild animals is ordered to "obligate mountain scrutiny"
In Hubei, a villager was sentenced for hunting wildlife, and ordered to compensate for the environmental damage to ecological resources for 15,420 yuan.
Due to the defendant's family poverty, the prosecutor's office activated alternative labor compensation for ecological repair costs, and achieved the organic unification of legal effects and social effects.
Wang忠良, deputy prosecutor-general of the Guangdong County Prosecutor's Office, announced on the 27th that through three months of "compulsory crossing mountains" and other alternative labor, the defendant has established a deep relationship with the wild monkey, and deeply feels guilty of previous animal hunting behavior.
On June 21, this year, a criminal-related civil public interest litigation in the field of ecological resources filed by the Procuratorate of the County of Pukong was openly heard in the county court and sentenced in the court.
The defendant was sentenced to three years in prison, a suspended sentence of four years, and a fine of 3,000 yuan, while ordering him to compensate for the environmental damage repair costs of 15,420 yuan.
According to the investigation, from the end of January 2014, the power grid was set up on the cliffs, and more than 20 wild animals were hunted, including squirrels, squirrels, coronavirus, and so on.
It belongs to the national second-level endangered wildlife conservation animal, and the small squirrels and crowns are listed in the National Landlife Wildlife Conservation List.
During the trial, he confessed his unlawful facts and acts and was willing to assume associated civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation of one of the houses, under the coordination of the Procuratorate of the county, the local village committee, forest station, and the third party reached an alternative labor compensation ecological repair costs agreement: that is, the house of houses through the domestication of monkeys in the village monkeys protection area, mandatory mountain crossing, forest protection for a year, provide public welfare labor compensation for ecological repair costs.
As for the prosecutor's suggestion, the court expressed approval and agreed that Mr. Zhang would actively fulfill his obligation to "substitute labor compensation for ecological repair costs" while enforcing the suspension.
At present, Zhou has been in compulsory labor for 3 months in the monkey protection zone, and has been active and performed well.
In recent years, the Procuratorate of Guangzhou County in practice integrated prosecutor functions and social governance behavior in an organic way, scientifically applying prosecutor's advice, investigation supervision, litigation supervision and other supervision methods, using judicial means to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment.
The United Nations awarded the “Guardian of the Earth Award” for the “Murricane Forest”
In the warm applause and revival of the music, the head of the “Murphy Forest” project, Xu Fei and the user representative, Shen Fei, went to the reception table and received the prize of the 2019 United Nations “Guardian of the Earth” award from the host.
The 2019 "Guardian of the Earth" award ceremony was held in New York City on 26th in the United States, and the "Murphy Forest" project, which mobiles hundreds of millions of people to participate in environmental protection actions, won the "Incentive and Action Award" among them.
A week ago, the UN Environment Programme announced the winning list at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but people who attended the awards ceremony on the same day were still excited.
In an interview with Xinhua news agency, Yin Anson, the UN Environment Programme’s executive director, said “The Ant Forest is an exciting innovation that puts hundreds of millions of people in action to understand the environmental challenges facing humankind and what humans can do for the environment.
It uses technology to connect people and the environment, allowing each individual to participate in actions to protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
The “Myrtle Forest” was launched in August 2016 on the Paypal platform by China’s Myrtle Financial Services Group, where users accumulate “green energy” by recording their day-to-day green travel in the “Myrtle Forest”, paying water and electricity fees online and other low-carbon actions, “seed trees” in the mobile phone.
For every virtual tree grown by a user, the Ant Forest and its public welfare partners plant a real tree in a deserted area.
As of August this year, 500 million users of the Ant Forest have cumulatively reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 1.2 billion trees in deserted areas.
In the "Global Guardian Award" awarded that day, Costa Rica was awarded for its national environmental efforts, and the prize-winning President of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado, praised the contribution of the "Wild Woods" on the scene, "impressively inspiring so many people to engage in green action."
Mr. Qing, chairman and chief executive of the company, said that the “Guardian of the Earth Award” is an affirmation of the “Myrtle Forest” project.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, and this honour belongs to all participants.
In the past three years, the ants forest has affected 500 million people, and in the next three years, the aim of the ants forest is to drive one billion people worldwide to participate in low-carbon actions.
Along with combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how farmers can earn more from green water.
In addition to providing employment opportunities through planting trees, it is also hoped to help farmers income increases through agricultural product development projects, e-commerce platforms, etc.
The public-benefit environmental model created by the ants forest based on digital technology has also been successfully taken out of the sea, attracted by other countries.
In June, GCash, the largest e-wallet in the Philippines, launched the Philippine version of The Ant Forest, which encourages Filipino users to better protect the environment by living a low-carbon life.
GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, environmental protection and public welfare organizations, and plan to plant 36,50,000 trees in the Philippines within a year.
The Guardian of the Earth Award is the highest award in the field of environmental protection awarded annually by the United Nations.
The "Myrtle Forest" award is after China's Seaman Dam Forestry Builder and China's Zhejiang Province "Chile Village Demonstration, World Village Recovery" project, and China's Green Innovation Project won the "Incentive and Action Award" award for the third year in a row.
Trade friction affects the U.S. economy’s “scoreboard”.
The U.S. second-quarter economic “score” showed that due to a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, the U.S. GDP growth has slowed significantly compared to the previous quarter.
Analysts point out that trade friction and the uncertainty that it brings are the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final adjustment data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday showed that U.S. GDP grew by 2 percent annually in the second quarter, equal to previously published adjustments, but significantly below 3.1 percent in the first quarter.
The data show that consumption growth has become a major driver of U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Individual consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, grew by 4.6% in the quarter, driving economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
Moreover, government spending and investment drove economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell by 6.3% compared to the previous quarter, delaying economic growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell by 5.7% compared to the previous quarter, and net exports delayed economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner at US-based Encyclopedia of Macroeconomic Consultancy, said private sector investment not only failed to keep up with last year’s growth momentum, but it dropped sharply because trade friction and rising uncertainty hit corporate confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to continue to decline next year.
Analysts say that while consumption growth has strongly supported the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that trade friction and the uncertainty it brings has affected consumer confidence and negatively impacted U.S. consumption outlook.
Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said in a recent survey that 38 percent of consumers spontaneously mentioned the negative effects of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest rate in a year and a half.
For the future trends of the U.S. economy, analysts generally expect the U.S. economy will continue to slow.
But experts also say that if trade frictions are eased, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Kelly Burch, a global economist at the British think tank, predicts that the U.S. economy will continue its gradual downturn since this year and the growth rate will fall to lower levels than in the second quarter.
Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandy predicts that U.S. economic growth will reach 2.3% this year and further slow down to 1.6% next year, assuming trade frictions do not continue to escalate.
Patnan Investment Company investment manager Ellen Hatsen pointed out that the biggest concern of the current enterprise is the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty that it brings, if the economic and trade dispute can be resolved, the uncertainty will be greatly reduced, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than now.
Matt Mayley, a stock strategist at Miller-Tabaker Asset Management, said trade frictions remained a "primary issue" and were the main cause of large volatility in the U.S. capital markets this year, and whether trade frictions can be properly resolved will be key to affecting the direction of the U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
Parents and parents of children aged 0 to 3 years old can take 10 days of parental leave each year.
Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women is the reflection of respect for and protection of human rights, and is also an important sign of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the fifteenth session of the 12th National People's Congress of the Ningxia Regions Autonomous Region, the regulations on the protection of women's rights and interests in the Ningxia Regions Autonomous Region were approved by high vote.
This is the first local regulation issued at the provincial level in Ningxia to enforce a comprehensive system for safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women, and will be officially implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted in 2007 were revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women of the People's Republic of China, divided into Chapter 9 and 65 articles, including general rules, political rights, cultural education rights and interests, labor and social security rights and interests, property rights and interests, personal rights, marriage family rights and interests, legal responsibilities, and annexes.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encouraged to explore the implementation of common parental leave for couples, which is still the first in the country.
In April of this year, the General Office of the State Council issued the "Guidelines on promoting the development of child care services for infants and young children under the age of 3" has relevant descriptions for couples to raise children together.
In the process of revising the Regulations, Ningxia proposed the innovation of "encouraging employers to encourage couples who have children in accordance with laws and regulations, and to give each couple 10 days of joint parental leave each year during the period between the age of 0 and 3 years of children."
At the same time, the Regulation highlights anti-sexual harassment and the protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements contained in the personal rights compilation of the current Civil Code of China, and specifies the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Regulations clearly prohibits frequent sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant educational, protection and prevention efforts to become a new benchmark in local legislation for protecting girls.
Regarding the right of women to know and handle the common property of married families, Article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates the right of women to know about the common property and the obligations of property registration agencies and relevant subjects to provide solid institutional support for women's rights.
In addition, addressing the social hotspot — — gender-based discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination, and absorbs the latest experience in joint negotiation practices to strengthen punishment for violations of gender-based discrimination and more effectively defend the legitimate rights and interests of women.
In recent years, the Joint Public Prosecution Law Department, civil affairs and other departments of the Ningxia Women's Union have achieved remarkable results in promoting and introducing social professional forces to participate in the mediation of conflicts in marriage and family disputes and the work against domestic violence.
The Regulations summarize and enhance this, encouraging the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and requiring people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia Xinjiang Union Yuan Longping academician workstation resistant to salt-aligned rice acre rice mill kilograms
The reporter was informed on the 27th from the Chengdu Administration of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region that the good news of the "Chengdu Union Yuan Longping Academic Workstation Resistant Salt Algae Rice Production Acceptance Assessment Assembly" recently held in the union came up, and the average acre of salt algae rice output exceeded one thousand kilograms.
A production measurement team consisting of six experts from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University, and the Hunan Agricultural and Rural Department of the province, took the rice sampling of the "salt series" at the scene.
After expert analysis, at the pH value of 8.8 to 9.6, the salinity content in the land of 5 ‰ to 6 ‰, the average acre of saline-resistant rice yielded 508.8 kg.
Xi'an Yuan Longping academician workstation executive director Wang Xiang said: "Our next step is to innovate on the basis of this year's trial, but also to reform, to cultivate and optimize the salt-resistant rice varieties again, so that the quality is better and the yield is higher."
Head of the production expert group, deputy dean of the agricultural science academy of Hailongjiang province, and researcher Lan Yongxian said: "Under the assumption that the production factors are unchanged, I think that the scientific and technological research will continue to strengthen, and the salt-based rice will continue to produce miracles in the salt-based land."
The Xinjiang Union belongs to the concentrated district of Xinjiang Anling South.
In October 2018, Yuan Longping academician's work stood at the opening of the Xi'an Alliance.
Yuan Longping academician led the team of experts to accelerate the introduction of the latest cultivated "salt-resistant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, build 960 acres of resistant salt-resistant rice base in the right wing of Corinth, use side-test demonstrations, and promote the technical route to promote the local poor population to increase production and income, and get out of poverty and become rich.
This salt-resistant alkaline rice site production, not only for China's salt-resistant alkaline low-production fields to raise to medium-high-production fields injection of hope, but also for China's equal conditions of salt-resistant alkaline rice cultivation provided scientific basis.

Liu Qing, Minister of Finance, said on Monday that as of today, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of some state-owned capital and social insurance funds, with a total transfer of state-owned capital of about 86.1 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statements at the deployment of the task of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Investment Commission to transfer part of the state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund.

In 2017, the State Council issued the "Plan for the Implementation of the Social Security Fund for the Implementation of a Part of State-owned Capital", requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the preliminary work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, and the total amount of state-owned capital has been transferred to about 860 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions under the responsibilities of the Ministry of Finance has basically been completed.

The transfer of state-owned funds to social security funds - from the starting point of the "fill social security fund money bag", the destination is to provide strong support for retirement guarantees.
However, I believe that this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but rather the opening of "mathematical additions".
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the State Capital Commission, the General Administration of Taxation and the Securities Regulatory Board jointly issued the "Notice on Comprehensively Promoting the Transition of Some State-owned Capital and Social Insurance Funds", clarifying the timetable for the Transition of State-owned capital and Social Insurance Funds, that the Central and local Transition of Some State-owned Capital and Social Insurance Funds work will be fully launched in 2019.
After the document was published, the Ministry of Finance and other departments were also implemented quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of the shares held in industrial and commercial banks and agricultural banks to social insurance funds, with the total value of the two shares exceeding 115 billion yuan.
According to the provisions, the undertaking entity, such as the social insurance fund, as a financial investor, shall enjoy the right to income, disposal and right of knowledge of the state-owned shares.
Industrial and agricultural banks said in the announcement that the changes in rights and interests will not lead to changes in the shareholders and actual controllers of the holding stock.
In this regard, I believe that similar state-owned enterprise equity transfer is not a simple change in equity assignment, but can inspire a series of effects "additional operations".
The first step of part of the state capital transfer of social security "additional results" can naturally reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by the whole people, and the development achievements are shared by the whole people.
After years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and the overall profitability is strong and relatively stable.
Among them, leading enterprises continue to do better.
On July 10, the Standing Meeting of the State Council decided to fully launch the work of transferring part of state-owned capital to the Social Security Fund this year.
The Ministry of Finance then said that it will work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council, to comprehensively promote the transfer of some state-owned capital and social security funds, fully reflecting the intergenerational fairness of the basic old-age insurance system and the sharing of the results of the development of state-owned enterprises among the people.
The second step of the "additional result" is to enhance the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social insurance funds are under pressure, and this time as the subject of the transferred state capital, most have the ability to sustain profitability and dividends, not only can effectively supplement the social insurance fund, but also provide a source of living water for social insurance funds.
It has been estimated that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital, the ratio of deposits of basic pension insurance can be reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the twist, the “additional result”, is to add stabilizers to the capital market.
The method of transferring the subjects to obtain profits is "dividend mainly, operating as a supplement".
Social insurance funds, as financial investors in state-owned capital, are indeed mainly based on the dividend earnings.
However, social insurance funds, as value investors in the capital market, have strong capital operating capabilities.
For the listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social insurance funds in holding shares will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, contribute to the improvement of the business level of enterprises, and have a positive positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, social security funds, as an investment trend, holding equity weight, is conducive to further enhancing its influence in the market, and plays the role of a "stabilizer" in the market.
In addition, it is also beneficial to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, leading investors to rational investment and value investment.
Karl Hartmann was enrolled at the Leipzig School of Music at the age of 18, after graduating from Webern.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of non-German publications, and later even stopped creating.
In 1933, he created Miserae and dedicated the work to "My Long Sleeping Friends".
The symphony debuted in Prague in 1935, but was harassed by Nazi bureaucrats.
After that, Hartman was determined not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartman's funeral concert was a violin and string concert, when the manuscript of the song was covertly taken from Germany and premiered in Switzerland.
Listen to the funeral concert performed by the Berne Indoor Orchestra at the Beethoven Festival in 2018.
U.S. Senate Approves Scalia as Labour Minister
On September 26, the U.S. Senate voted on the nomination of President Trump for Eugene Scalia as Labour Minister.
The vote resulted in 53 votes in favour and 44 against, and no Democrat voted in favour of Scalia.
Republicans believe that Scalia’s history makes him well suited to serve as Labour Minister.
But in the view of Democrats, Scalia has long stood on the opposite side of workers and trade unions in her lawyer career.
Scalia will replace Alexander Akosta.
Following a “generous treatment” of U.S. billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of sexual assault and trafficking in girls, then labor minister Akosta announced his resignation in July under massive public pressure.
Scalia, 56, is a partner of a renowned U.S. law firm, whose father is late U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Anthony Scalia.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government that is responsible for labor-related affairs.

According to the procedure, Ghana's nomination must also be approved by the Senate.
The Federal Emergency Measures Agency, under the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating federal government resources to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks that occur in the United States.
Since the National Day's 35th anniversary parade debuted for the first time, every large parade has been organized, there will be a "gigantic hegemony" of strategic missile forces.
"This National Day parade was the first time the Rocket Army appeared in Long An Street after the 'soldat' turned into the 'army.'"

Iran is confirmed to develop advanced centrifuge and further suspend the implementation of the Iranian nuclear agreement
According to the "Central Agency", the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on 26 September that Iran has used advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium, which has once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Iran isly gradually violating the restrictions of the Iran nuclear agreement in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018 and the resumption and tightening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran has suspended two other pledges in July to keep its reserves of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and the purity of enriched uranium not more than 3.67 percent.
Under the nuclear agreement, Iran can only install about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and allows Iran to use only a small number of more advanced models for research, but does not produce enriched uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing a more advanced centrifuge, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, potentially for use in the manufacture of nuclear bombs.
The IAEA report said: “On September 25, the agency has confirmed that Iran’s development of advanced centrifuges of Model 2, Model 3 ... is accumulating or is preparing to accumulate enriched uranium.”
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency submitted the report to its member states on Monday, and a diplomatic official responded: “They are busy with the (Natans) facility.”

Italian education ministers have proposed a sugar tax to protect people’s health.
Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti, a member of the Five Star Movement, presented a motion to Parliament to suggest a new tax policy for high-sugar drinks, snacks and flight tickets.
According to the bill proposed by Minister of education Fioramonti, the Italian government will impose a snack tax on healthy food products such as sugary beverages, snacks, etc. At the same time, it will impose an environmental tax on air tickets, 1 euro on domestic flights and 1.5 euro on international flights.
Fioramonti said the Italian government is expected to get 3 billion euros in taxes through this seemingly small set of tax measures.
The tax revenues will be used in the fields of education, health and environmental protection.

In the course of driving, the vehicle can intelligently change the road according to the road conditions, and it can also judge the driving condition of surrounding vehicles, and automatically avoid near-distance excesses.
Thro the journey, the passenger area screen shows pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even the vehicle block, you can see in advance the change of the front red and green light and the waiting time information, all the conditions of the road.
I’ve heard about self-driving on television before, thinking it’s far away from us, but today it feels magical to find it in our lives.
We expect it to truly enter the lives of citizens in the future.

China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
White Paper: China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
With China’s comprehensive national strength and international influence rising rapidly, some people internationally worry that China will follow the path of “strength and supremacy,” and some have put forward the so-called “China threat theory.”
This has both cognitive misrepresentation, deep-rooted prejudice, and the psychological imbalance brought by the power to prolong, as well as deliberate distortions in safeguarding their own interests.
Achieving national prosperity, national revitalization and people's happiness are both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the people of all countries.
“China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.”
China is the main stabilizer and source of momentum for world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, China's scientific and technological innovation injects new momentum for world economic growth, and the role of the stabilizer and source of momentum of the Chinese economy in the future is more highlighted.
At present, the global economic growth momentum is insufficient, and a stable Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and agricultural modernization are accelerating, the economic structure is deeply adjusted, industry optimization continues to escalate, and new economic growth points continue to emerge.
“A report by the McKinsey Global Research Institute suggests that by 2040, China and the rest of the world’s economies are expected to merge together to create $22 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15% to 26% of the total global economy, and enhanced cooperation between the rest of the world’s economies and China will create enormous economic value.”
The White Paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China's more stable economic operation, higher quality of growth, and long-term growth prospects are beneficial for the development of the world economy in the long term.
Seeing China’s economic development as a “threat” and “challenge”, trying to pull China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, and value chain, to “disconnect” China from the world economy, is both impossible and harmful.
The White Paper pointed out that opening-up in all directions creates more opportunities for countries to share the "Chinese dividend".
China firmly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, achieving a more vigorous and higher level of opening up to the outside world, China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, and more large-scale "going out" benefits more countries.
Openness should be two-way and mutually beneficial, not one-way and one-way beneficial.
Mutual benefit can last long.”
China is committed to continuously expanding imports, easing market access, improving the business environment, and strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights, and other countries should also expand their openness and take appropriate measures to improve their own business environment.
Only if all parties move towards each other can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, forming a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The White Paper notes that China provides more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality “Belt and Road” joint construction, building a platform for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively carrying out foreign aid.
"China's development has benefited the international community, and it has always not forgotten to give back to the international family and provide more and better public goods to the international community."
In a recent written interview with Xinhua news agency, Andrey Strepnev, general manager of the Russian Export Center, said that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the field of economic and trade, further optimize the export structure, and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
In Russia's exports to China, forestry, machinery and chemical industry account for a considerable proportion, at the same time, the export of agricultural products is also very important, including both oily products, meat products and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-material and non-energy products to China have also shown a good and stable development trend.
Speaking of Russia’s optimization of its export structure to China, Strepnev said that the Russian side has set up a mission to expand the export of high-tech products to meet the import demand of high-tech products in countries and regions around the world, including China.
Russia will further improve its financial and non-financial support measures to promote the further growth of the number of high-tech enterprises.
Sljepniov said that Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China, and develop cooperation with China in the fields of pharmaceuticals and aeronautical manufacturing.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He stressed that in many fields, Russian products have "a quality advantage and a competitive price" compared to Western products.
Speaking of the two countries’ goal of achieving a bilateral trade volume of $200 billion by 2024, Strepnev said that fields such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal.
The Russian side intends to promote the diversification of supply in these areas and promote the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that Russia intends to push its exporters into the global value chain, where China is one of the development directions.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas and chemistry are fully able to participate in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, "to establish more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries".
Sergei Strepnev said the Russian Export Center is taking various measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Import and Export Bank to support the export of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to promote Russian goods to enter the Chinese market more conveniently, and develop new types of export products to China.

Demonstrators shoot down Egypt's president's mountain rain and the authorities showed strong repression
Twitter tags and social media are vigorously urging the Egyptian people to go to the streets today to peacefully call for President Sisi to resign.
But the authorities have already shown that they intend to use the force of repression.
Since then-military chief Sisi launched a military coup in 2013, opposition has almost disappeared in Egypt, and any form of protest is even more endangered.
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since the rare outbreak of protests last weekend demanding Sisi resign.
The vanity of corruption accusations surrounding Sisi and his family have led thousands of people to march on the streets on the 20th.
The Egyptian Interior Ministry said yesterday that any attempt to undermine the stability of the country will be tackled with determination.
The city center of Cairo has long been under high alert, with police, security vehicles and clothed police everywhere on the streets around Tahrir Square in Egypt in 2011.
The peninsula television that security forces detained several important scholars and social scientists, including Cairo University professor of political science and renowned columnist Nafa.
He tweeted: “I have no doubt that continuing to give Sisi absolute rule would be disastrous.”
“He immediately resigned in the interests of Egypt.”
Before Nafa was arrested, Hosni, who served as a spokesman for former Egyptian army chief of staff Annan, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Sisi for the presidency.
The Constitutional Party chairman Davud was also detained.
Analysts and politicians believe that at a time of escalating economic distress among the poor and the middle class, the dissidents’ approach reflects the instability and vulnerability of the government.
Opposition leader Ayman Nour, who has been a candidate for the presidency, said: “The arrests highlight how the regime disregards the Egyptian people and how fearful it is.”
“As the economy has been plunged into a collapse by him, coupled with widespread political oppression, Sisi tries to convey a clear message about the important generals and political figures he may be replacing.”
Noor pointed out that in the event of a continued deterioration of the socio-economic situation, the high-pressure approach of the government will only increase the anger of the people.
As the fear barrier has been broken, he expects more people to go to the streets.
Formerly an Egyptian military building contractor, Ali, a businessman and actor currently in exile in Spain, began posting a series of videos earlier this month, claiming to have benefited from government corruption, sparking a wave of small-scale demonstrations across cities over the weekend.
Ali said his company’s general contractor, Amrak, didn’t have to go through a legal bidding process to get a profitable contract, highlighting the corruption of the military and Sisi’s family, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He deeply regretted his involvement.
Ali claims that he has helped Sisiga’s luxurious palaces and luxury hotels in contrast to the extreme poverty of the current Egyptians, and that the other party has not yet paid.
On Twitter, topics such as “You’re not alone,” “Sessi, you’re done,” “Sessi, you’re done,” and “Next Friday,” have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and tweets calling for people to walk out in the streets in a peaceful way to demand Sessi’s resignation.
Hollywood Egyptian star Amalek’s Twitter has 7 million followers.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: “Sessi is doomed... he’s done, and those who support him are now making a big mistake.”

Is sport tired?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study conducted on athletes showed that after high-intensity exercise, the brain also shows signs of fatigue.
The study, led by Marseille Pesigréon, a specialist at the French Pitié-Salpetril Hospital, shows that there is an unclear link between brain and physical labor: both require cognitive control of activity.
Pesiegreon explains: “You need to control the autonomous processes that can force yourself to stop when muscle and joint pain occurs.”
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sports (INSEP).
The school’s experts are responsible for guiding athletes to prepare for the Olympics.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from over-training syndrome, i.e. an uncontrollable feeling of fatigue after high-load exercise, the body is unable to recover, and performance decreases.
INSEP raises a question: Is part of this condition caused by nerve fatigue, the nerve fatigue caused by excessive brain labor?
The study was published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

Two major high-pressure projects.
On the 26th, the high-voltage direct-stream power transmission project, Suzhou 1000kV special high-voltage GIL comprehensive pipeline project, was launched.
Both of these projects occupy the highlights of the current world transmission technology in their respective fields, and will make China's large-scale optimization of energy distribution significantly improved after delivery.
Guo Zhi, the general economist of the National Energy Bureau, said that the East to South China project is the world's largest transmission capacity and the most distant transmission project.
Its deployment is important for promoting the development of Xinjiang energy bases and ensuring the supply of electricity in the east of China.
GIL is a gas insulated metal closed transmission line.
The project has created the record of the highest global voltage level and strongest transmission capacity of the GIL project, and achieved the joint operation of the highest voltage level of the China-East core power grid.
According to the National Power Grid Company, the power transmission distance from the east to the south is 3324 kilometers.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of the electricity will be lost along the way, and the project has been researched and developed, so that the economic delivery distance has been significantly increased to more than 3000 kilometers.
After the implementation of the project, every 8 hours and 20 minutes, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered, which can help to solve the problem of the consumption of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full-load estimates, this single line will deliver electricity annually to 600 to 85 billion kilowatts, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's entire year's electricity consumption.
The Sutoon GIL Integrated Pipeline Project is a controlling project of the special high-pressure communication network across the Yangtze River.
If conventional shuttle air lines are used across the river, two giant iron towers of more than 450 meters will be built on the Yangtze River, and an artificial island the size of more than four football fields will be built for each tower.
In this regard, the national power grid boldly innovated, developed a compact special high-voltage exchange GIL transmission technology, and passed the river from underwater through the tunnel, avoiding the impact on the gold route.
Two projects have made new leaps in China's electrical equipment manufacturing capacity.
At present, the national power grid has cumulatively built the "10 to 11 straight" special high-voltage project, and the "4 to 3 straight" is under construction.
China's foreign debt structure continues to optimize and foreign debt stability increases
Overall, China's foreign debt structure continues to be optimized, and the stability of foreign debt is enhanced.
Wang Chun Ying, spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration and general economist, said on the 27th that China's main foreign debt indicators are within the internationally recognized security line, and foreign debt risk can be controlled overall.
Wang Chung-in made the above statement when the Foreign Exchange Bureau released foreign debt data at the end of June 2019, in response to reporters' questions.
The data show that as of the end of June 2019, China's total balance of foreign debt (including foreign currencies) was $1998 billion, up $26.3 billion from the end of March 2019, an increase of 1.3%, mainly due to the growth of the balance of debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70 percent of China's overall foreign debt growth was driven by non-residents buying domestic RMB bonds, and among non-residents mainly central banks and other medium-term investors.
At the end of June 2019, the share of medium and long-term foreign debt increased by 3 percentage points at the end of March 2019, while the share of domestic foreign debt increased by 1 percentage point at the end of March 2019.
Wang said that with China's RMB bonds being included in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Comprehensive Index in April 2019, international investors have further increased their recognition of the Chinese bond market and continued to increase their domestic RMB bonds.
"China's international payments areined in overall balance, and foreign debt risks are controlled."
On the 27th, the reporter learned from the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences that at present, Yunnan grassland corruption has been effectively prevented and controlled, and has not caused large-scale outbreaks and catastrophes, and the prevention and control work has achieved gradual results.
In January of this year, Yunnan Purchase City Jiangsu county for the first time discovered migrated grassland ransomware from abroad, then confirmed in Yunnan 129 county, grassland ransomware also gradually spread from Yunnan to mainland China, posing a direct threat to China's food production.
It is a major migratory pest originating in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the Americas and is a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global Early Warning, with the characteristics of "international, migratory, explosive and destructive".
The pest harms more than 80 crops, such as corn, sugarcane, high-carbon, and can cause up to 70% of production loss.
The prevention is difficult, and there is no registered pesticide for the insect prevention in China.
Since the invasion of Yunnan, Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has selected Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences researchers to lead the innovation team of Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Green Collaboration for the Prevention and Control of Cross-border Harmful Biosciences, to head to the front line, field investigation, sampling, and carry out technical guidance and experimental demonstrations.
The team has initially mastered the population characteristics of Yunnan grasslands, hostile insect resources, overseas insect sources characteristics, population migration trajectories, drug toxicity and field prevention effects.
They actively conduct research and application of green prevention and control technology, through the implementation of green prevention and control new technologies such as population monitoring, insect seduction, scientific drugs and agricultural measures, the prevention and control effect in the demonstration zone has reached more than 90%, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting the enemy resources and the ecological environment, and providing technical guarantees for Yunnan to effectively control the outbreak of catastrophe and sustainable governance.
At present, Yunnan grassland corruption has been effectively prevented and controlled, and has not caused large-scale outbreaks to become disasters, and prevention and control work has achieved gradual results.
The next step, the Yunnan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will focus on the development of ecological mechanisms for the outbreak of crowd migration and invasion, and breakthrough the construction of biological prevention and green prevention and control technology systems.
At the same time, we will actively promote cross-border international cooperation and strive to establish joint key laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration zones abroad to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities of Yunnan grassland.

New regulations: social capital must be qualified to obtain rural land management rights
Social capital must be qualified to obtain rural land management rights
Measures for the Management of the Movement of Rural Land Operating Rights to Publicly Seek Opinions on the Movement of Social Capital to Acquire Land Operating Rights by Industrial and Commercial Enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice on the public consultation of the "Methods for the management of the flow of rural land management rights (revised draft request for opinions)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Opinion draft") and increased the supervision and risk prevention of the movement of social capital such as industrial and commercial enterprises to acquire land management rights.
The opinion draft is now open to the public.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to implement the newly amended Rural Land Contract Law, further consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, and implement the "three-power distribution" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Measures for the management of the flow of rural land contracting rights and formed a draft of opinions.
The Beijing Youth Journal reporter learned that the first published Opinion draft had several important changes.
The newly amended "Rural Land Contract Law" clarifies the scope of land circulation, implements the "three-power distribution" concept, sets "land contract management rights" and "land management rights" separately, and makes a clear distinction between land contract management rights transfer, exchange and land management rights flow (lease, transfer, shareholding or otherwise).
In this Opinion, in order to implement the "three-power distribution" concept, effectively respond to the amendment of the Rural Land Contract Law, and taking into account the large differences between the parties, procedures, supervision and exchange of land management rights and land contracts, the amendment has defined the scope of the flow, focusing on the flow of land management rights, the flow method includes lease, shareholding, etc., the name of the rules from the "Rural Land Contract Management Rights Management Management Measures" to the "Rural Land Management Rights Management Measures".
For the transfer or exchange of land contracting rights, administrative measures shall be specified separately.
In the context of the "three-power distribution", the shareholding of farmers is only a limited period of land management rights.
In theory, even if a bankruptcy settlement occurs, the farmer is only at risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, so it is no longer necessary to provide for the contractual return of the original contractor, and it is also in conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent the risk of land loss by farmers, priority shares, first-lease back shares, and repurchase methods have been developed in practice.
Given that preferred shares have a more mature theoretical discussion in corporate law, it is recommended to use it as an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of loss of equity.
