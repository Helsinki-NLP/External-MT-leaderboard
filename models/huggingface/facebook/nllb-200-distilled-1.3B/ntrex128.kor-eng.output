The Welsh Senators were worried about what they saw as a bullshit.
Some members of the Senate are disappointed with the proposal to change their title to MWPs (Members of the National Assembly for Wales).
It was caused by a plan to change the name of the parliament to the National Assembly for Wales.
Members of the Senate, across the political spectrum, are worried that it will cause ridicule.
One Labour senator was worried that his group would achieve the fate of the Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
One Welsh National Party senator said the group as a whole was not happy and offered an alternative.
One Welsh Conservative said his group had a cheeky stance on the name change, but noticed that it was a bit of a ramble to change from MWP to Muppet.
In this context the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of u.
The parliamentary assembly is currently drafting a bill to introduce a name change and the final decision on what to call the members of the assembly will be a matter for the members themselves, of course, said Mr. Zheng.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Government the power to change the name of the parliament.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on a proposal that had broad support for the parliament to be called the National Assembly for Wales.
On the question of the impartiality of the members of the Senate, the committee supported the Welsh Assembly Members or WMPs, but the MWP received the most support in public consultation.
The Senate appears to be proposing an alternative, but efforts to reach an agreement will be a hassle for Speaker Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the change in a matter of weeks.
The reform bill also includes changes to the way the Parliament works, including rules on disqualification of Senators and the establishment of a committee system.
The Senate will be voting on the question of what it will be called when they discuss the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an effort to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, a neighboring country that calls one of its provinces Macedonia.
Greece has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor raises territorial issues and has repeatedly rejected the neighboring country's EU and NATO membership.
President of Macedonia, Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The winter silent church of St. Martin in Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the older people who spoke to me there were bars and churches in every alley", said Mr. Adam.
"Today, not both".
He said he couldn't understand the bar disappearing.
"People are socializing in a different way these days", he says.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood living room that people go to regularly".
In the case of the church, he's worried that the money from the sale of assets won't stay as long as the leaders expected, and that soon the leaders will go back to where they started.
He added that the church could be replaced by apartment buildings with luxury condominiums with people who wouldn't help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who live in condominiums in this building will be white", he said, "and that will be a sign that these churches will close all at once, because most people who move into these condominiums are less likely to be members of the church".
Both churches were built by white believers before Harlem became a metropolitan community, or black metropolis, in 1870, a decade after St. Martin.
The white traditionalists moved in in the 1930s.
A black man who was worshiping next to me had legal ownership of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black religious leader under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on Harlem's main shopping street, 125th Street, and opposed hiring or promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but as the parishioners of the Johnson family planned to rebuild, they ordered curry.
Reverend Johnson's son, Reverend David Johnson, and the successors of St. Martin's proudly called the curry the "crown of the poor".
In July, a curry expert called it something else -- the gift of the curry culture and the irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first carol played by Dionysius A. Lind, a black musician who moved it to a larger carol in a Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What's been playing out in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex story for architects and contractors, some of whom have involved civil leaders of the church, others who have involved the diocese.
The parish's governing body, the Diocese, is made up of civil leaders, and although the Diocese was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors it sent, the Diocese wrote to the Diocese in July with a growing concern that the Diocese would try to shift the costs to the Diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in their parish.
He attacked a 13-year-old kid in California while he was diving for lobster.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy diving in California on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that the boy was diving with a friend for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's screams for help and went down to the group to pull him out of the water.
Hamel thought he was a god at first, but he realized he was screaming.
I bit you!'
His skull was completely torn, and he said he realized that the shark had caught the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is on the intensive care list.
The species of shark that attacked is not known.
Captain Larry Giles, a rescue worker, told the media that a shark had appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but that he had determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe head injuries.
Authorities have blocked access to Ponto Beach in Swansea from Casablanca in Escinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not threatened.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's will be competing with Boots, Super Drugs, and Devenhams at the department store's Style Beauty Corner, where the experts are working.
As part of a massive entry into the £2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow amid the withdrawal of fashion and homeware sales, the larger Beauty Corner will be on trial in 11 stores nationwide and will be rolled out to more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investing in the beauty industry is like a supermarket aiming for the shelf space once occupied by TVs, electronics ranges, and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it would order up to 3,000 products to double the size of its beauty corner, which includes brands such as Leblon, Daisy, Tweeterman, and Doctor Poppo, the first of its kind.
Existing brands like L'Oreal, Mabeline, and Bitsby will also take up more space in similar brand segments to those found in stores like boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its boutique makeup line, allowing most products to be marketed as vegan-friendly, which is preferred by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Frangipanies Shop is piloting two Sainsbury's stores, opening for the first time in Croydon, south London, and a second in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The shift from online shopping and buying smaller quantities of groceries at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Koop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounts like Aldi or Riddle, which have more service and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has hundreds of Argos outlets and introduced a large number of Hobbitons, which it bought two years ago. Sainsbury's says it has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to fix its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended in a dispute over how to divide the revenue from the pharmacy store in the supermarket.
The new strategy will come after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Cellesio, the owner of Lloyd's pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Sainsbury said Lloyd's would play a key role in the plan by expanding the scale of luxury skincare brands such as La Rochefoucaulds and Beech to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, says, "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty corners to improve the customer experience.
We also hired specially trained colleagues to provide advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient location means we are now in the heart of the beauty that can't close our eyes to challenge the old ways of shopping".
Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal with the infamous Peter Jones.
Dragon's Den Stine Peter Jones has split after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal related to his lifestyle brand business to focus on a new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homeware and handbag brand, Truly.
The two men's business has been likened to the brand of Gunes Quintro.
The 37-year-old morning host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, angered at his last-minute withdrawal from the lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on a huge new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones had agreed to a new deal worth up to £1.5m from TV Golden Girl at a tense meeting at his corporate headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, meaning she no longer had enough time to devote to their homeware and handbag brand Truely.
The business was likened to the brand of the Gunners Quintet and was close to doubling Willoughby's fortune of around £1100.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane and left the UK for one of his holiday resorts.
According to one source, Truly was Holly's only top priority.
It would be her long-term future for decades to come.
Her decision completely shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday.
"Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse full of goods waiting to be sold".
Experts believe the departure of the morning presenter, one of Britain's most commercially successful stars, will be costly due to the vast investment in products ranging from cushions and towels to clothing and homeware, and the potential for a delay in launch.
And that would mean the end of an old friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for a decade.
Willoughby founded Cap and Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand publicity ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Anthony McFatlin as host of ITV's Cinna Celebrity Dinner.
A source close to Jones said last night that Shawley would not comment on his business dealings.
We had a rough conversation and we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he had received in the news media about someone making unflattering comments and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why would President Trump give up so easily?
Trump said in his fake news anchor, the "Bullshit".
"I gave up nothing".
He described Kim Jong-un's interest in a second meeting after his first in Singapore in June, which was a big step toward denuclearisation.
However, the denuclearization talks were suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Li Yongho told world leaders at the UN that at Saturday's summit, North Korea was not hearing a coherent response from the United States on its initial moves to reduce its arms.
He said instead the US is continuing sanctions aimed at continuing pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We're doing well for North Korea", he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a good relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Chairman Kim had produced positive results, including ending the missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Chairman Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people outside in this packed stadium, we have 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of the stadium.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and earthquake devastate the island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, I heard stories that foreign NGOs were not needed.
More than 10 percent of the population of Rombok has been evacuated, but there has been no official announcement of the death toll in the country, which is needed to receive international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very firm about not asking for international assistance", Mr. Spahn said.
While the Saber Children are building a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear if the overseas staff will be able to work on site.
Indonesian disaster management spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian officials were looking into the situation in Palu and whether the international agency could be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Assuming that Indonesia is constantly being hit by earthquakes, Indonesia is sadly underprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunabi sanctuary is built on an arch, which is not easily found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning's effectiveness, there is a possibility that the tsunami warning siren in Fallu will continue to be missing.
At its best, it is difficult to travel between many of Indonesia's islands.
Natural disasters make logistical support even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lagging infrastructure a priority in his election campaign and invested heavily in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has left the Joko administration frustrated, as he faces re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the inter-sectarian tensions that remain in Indonesia, where Muslims are the majority and embrace a more conservative form of faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs used knives, bows, arrows and other brutal weapons to fight in the streets, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing thousands.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge down with the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea in the 89th minute on Saturday.
Sturridge was given a pass by Sheridan Shakirey as the team was trailing 1-0 with a lead of around 30 yards over Chelsea.
He hit the ball to his left before firing a shot in front of the far post.
As he moved toward the upper right corner of the court, the ball flew much higher above the zone.
The ball eventually fell over the bouncing Kepa Arisabalaga onto the court.
"I tried to get into that position to get the ball, because players like Shark always play as much as possible as a forward, so I tried to make myself as much as possible", said Shaun Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a touchdown, I didn't think it was a pass, I just threw the puck".
In the 25th minute, Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after getting a point from Belgian star Eden Azar.
In that match, the Blues striker passed to Matteo Kovacic before separating near midfield and half-powered to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick give and go in midfield.
And then he led Azar into the box and he made a beautiful shot.
Azar ran faster than the defence and finished with a left-footed goal, passing Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the FA Cup.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League qualifying match at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will play Vidéoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
A large number of people were reportedly lying on the rubble of a building that collapsed in a 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday, with waves up to 20 feet high, government spokesman Suetopo Fuero Nugroho said at a news conference.
Fallujah, a city of more than 380,000 people, was covered in the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man in connection with the stabbing death of a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Beaconhead on Merseyside this morning.
The body of 44-year-old was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Muse on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged anyone who had seen or heard anything in the area to help.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the John Street area to contact us.
I'm also going to appeal to anyone who may have information that is important to our investigation, especially taxi drivers, who may have something on the dash cam footage".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Beaconhead and was found on private property.
Friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found.
Police said they are in the process of directing the victim to a close relative and are investigating.
A taxi driver in Grayson Moose was trying to get back to his apartment when police said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he discovered what had happened he had nothing to say.
Residents are now hearing that it will be hours before they are allowed to enter.
A police officer heard a man say that the entire neighborhood was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
She repeats the words, "It's too awful".
At 2pm, two police cars are outside the low-level and another one is outside.
Many policemen were standing in the lower line guarding the block of flats.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to hit the history books with its bird-like shape.
Its expulsion may be a poetic justification for his Taliban destruction of many cultural and religious relics in Britain, produced by his fervent Puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian League described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "spooky, unrealistic attempt to rewrite the history of the Cromwellian".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell League, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be the target of the current debate over the removal of statues.
The destruction of the English Civil War statues was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrongly, Cromwell was sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Harmo Sonkeycroft's remarkable Cromwell re-enactment is a testament to 19th century opinion and a historical record of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was more widely recognised in the late 19th century than today as the protector of Parliament against foreign pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it's a perfectly accurate reproduction is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our country since then, and Cromwell is a memorable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as a protector of the monarchy are also worthy of honor and celebration".
A killer pig drives a Chinese farmer to his death.
A farmer in southwestern China has been killed after being attacked by a market pig, local media reported.
The man, identified only as Saint Zhu Yuan, was found dead with an aorta severed and covered in blood near a pig farm in the market of Liufangshuyi in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in Xining, Qinghai province, China, May 30, 2005.
He said he and his cousin went to the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin saw that he was dead, and the next pig found our door open.
He told us that there was a large water tank with blood buried in the pillar.
According to reports, a forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig injured and killed the farmer.
"My cousin's leg was badly damaged in the pititute", said his cousin, known as Mr. Liu Xiaobian, according to the Guizhou Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed Coman entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Coman's or his cousin's.
As police gathered evidence at the scene, a market manager told the evening news that the pig was being held to prevent it from attacking people.
Reports say that the family of the victim and the market manager are in negotiations for compensation in connection with his death.
Rare, but there have been previous reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with fatal injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer, and this continued until his wife chased the pig.
After an Oregon farmer was fed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were abnormally aggressive, but that the taste of blood could play a trigger".
"They're just messing with me.
They're young kids, very curious... and they don't mean you any harm.
"You have to have enough respect for pigs", he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants bring heavy rain to the northwest United States.
According to daily forecasts, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves into the cold seas off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is expected to bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Orgonia, Mexico.
Rosa is forecast to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the atmospheric crust will take shape in the Pacific Ocean and begin moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. Rosa will begin sending deep tropical moisture northward toward the southwest of the United States as it approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the approaching tropical moisture interacting with the atmospheric crust will create a wide range of heavy rainfall in the southwest region for several days.
Locally, one to four inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mudslides, desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, will bring two to three inches of rain per hour locally.
Two to four inches of rain is expected to fall in the southwest, especially most of Arizona.
The weather is rapidly deteriorating due to the nature of the tropical rainfall, and there is a possibility of flash flooding.
The advice to risk walking through the desert, where the threat of tropical rain is very bad.
The rains can make the river heavy and affect the valley, and thunderstorms will bring down heavy winds and dust.
The approaching winds will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
There is a chance of more than 1.5 inches of rain, with debris floating and the rainfall sliding down the road.
This will be the first rainfall of the season in the region.
The subtropical cyclone will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before becoming more widespread on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
The rain will extend into the Four Corners throughout Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic cools, the single-track traffic across the United States will be extreme, but the return journey will be warm.
Sometimes this results in extreme temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is the big heat wave in the central United States on Sunday.
There was a temperature variation of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, summer heat will continue and expand again.
Many parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to begin experiencing temperatures in the 80s in October, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could average 10 degrees on Tuesday and 80 degrees on Tuesday.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to be above average in early October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Cabernet.
More than 20 million people watched an interesting testimony on Thursday on the Six Television Network from U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Cabrino and Christine Blashford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political stalemate continued with stations disrupting regular broadcasts late Friday, a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Plec, who will investigate the charges for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cabrino had drunkenly tried to grab her and strip her at a high school party.
Cabrino said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's report, more than 2.4 million people were expected to watch it on Friday.
Nielsen was compiling the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other broadcasters such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network did not immediately come up with figures.
Nielsen usually has a bit of a problem with counting the number of people who watch it while it's working.
Considering this, it's similar to the number of people watching a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News, which is strongly supported by the opinion host Cabrino, was ahead of all networks, averaging 5.69 million viewers for the day of the hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC's ratings were second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest has not diminished since the hearing.
Fleck was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the Republican Party's Omugan said he would side with Cabrino, he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing and was caught on CNN and CBS cameras being shouted at by protesters.
He was seen standing with his eyes down for several minutes as he was beaten, and was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to his country?
You had power when many women were powerless.'"
Flake said his office had released the statement and that he would have to say more at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
When the Judiciary Committee voted in the full Senate session on whether Cabrino should be appointed, both cable and broadcast networks covered the live broadcast.
But Flake said he did so on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against Caberno in the next state, which minority Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was somewhat convinced in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Hicks.
After talks with Hicks and some senators, Flake made a decision.
Plek's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Caberno without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Cabrino's allegations.
Prime Minister May accuses a critic of playing politics with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has denounced critics who say her plans to leave the European Union threaten the interests of the country and play politics with Britain's future in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham for a Conservative Party meeting on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her, published on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said that the proposal that Britain and the EU should each levy tariffs was "completely unjustified" and strongly attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit.
Police arrested Dayton Simpson, suspect in the death of LSU football player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released video of Simpson and Simpson fighting, and police said that Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, his lawyers said.
The East Burton-Rosie Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Police Science Investigation Institute, and Southern University Police and community members assist in the investigation for the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement for their hard work and justice implementation.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Burton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Wade's death left the team in a state of despair and a clash of tears.
"This is something that's always been concerning", said Wade.
A volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City.
Volcanic material from the Popocatepetl volcano has spread from the Mexican capital to its southern neighbors.
The National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would be moving away from the volcano as volcanic activity began in the area and 183 gases and volcanic materials were released over 24 hours.
The center observed several rumbling sounds and a weak earthquake.
The photos posted on social media show that in cities near Mexico City, such as Sochi, car curtains were covered in a thin layer of ash.
Geologists have found that the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, has been active since a 7.1 magnitude quake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
Known as the Khandong Gojo Volcano, it has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and six people were killed in a riot in Barcelona on Saturday. Thousands of people took part in a rival protest to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized independence vote.
A group of masked separatists, blocked by the repressive police, spread egg baptism and powdered paint on the police, creating a cloud of black dust on a tourist-filled street.
The police and the rioters used pressure pads to stop the fighting until late that day.
For more than several hours, pro-independence protesters shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive, Spain, forever!" along with pro-unification protesters.
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests.
Tensions remain in the region, which claims independence after a referendum on October 1, which is considered illegal in Spain but commemorated by separatist Catalans.
Although voter turnout was low, with anti-separatist voters usually boycotting the vote, voters overwhelmingly chose independence.
Last year, almost 1,000 people were injured after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in a region where violent clashes were taking place, according to Catalan authorities.
Pro-independence protesters stayed out all night to stop a police-backed protest on Friday.
The protest continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrical engineer who took part in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would ever be independent.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw parents crying for joy that they could vote, but we're stuck right now", he said.
Despite narrowly winning the local elections in December, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have been trying to gain momentum this year, along with the most prominent leaders who have been jailed or jailed awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests by phone with the help of police, said the clashes were caused by politicians on both sides.
"The point will be more fierce", said the Dungeon.
One of nine Catalan leaders jailed for public dissent late last year, Oriol Hunqueraz, announced on Saturday that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"To stand as a candidate in the European Parliament elections is to sharply criticize the regression of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has shown us", said Dung.
London, Delhi: Men arrested after their homes were hit by cars
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was driven into a house in London.
The incident occurred at around 7.30pm on Thursday in Ballinaard Crescent.
Sheriff Bob Fleming said the door and the building were damaged.
At some point the Mausoleum may have been launched by car.
In the first leg of the mega-game, Livingston beat Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Mengele's first goal saved the Livingston win.
The promotion sent Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club, shocking Rangers.
Dolly Mengele's kick proved the difference from when Gary Holt's team took revenge on Hibernian for second place.
Gerard's side remain unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face the leaders of Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Before that, Rangers will host Lapith Bean in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues a six-game unbeaten streak with Holt, who is still reeling from a defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing the chance to beat the straight-A visitors.
Holt's team should have been way ahead of them before they scored, with their directness causing all the trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough and went to the goal line. Alan Ryszgaard then slipped and met Craig Halkett's header and allowed his breakthrough.
The hosts knew they could spoil the visitors in a set-piece situation, so they were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that was how he got the decisive goal in.
The Rangers allowed a free throw and Livingston approached and drilled a hole-in-one with Declan Gallagher and Robinson to help the mid-district scoring Mango.
This gave the Rangers the ball but they knew they couldn't break through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was relieved.
Alfredo Morelos got a save from Kelly, but the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor. Ryszgow moved quickly in another Livingston set play.
While Halkett's challenge to replacement Glenn Middleton and two penalty kicks in a handball went to waste, Cross kept coming into the Livingston area and kept coming out of the basket.
The curious analysis of Livingston's spleen.
Tony Macaroony at the BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont, and the rest of the cast.
Livingston's marvelous performance and the result.
For one man, continuing to exceed expectations at this growing age, they were outstanding.
Their style and organization has changed little since returning to the top team, but the big ball will have to go back to Holt, who gave the team a boost.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett excelled at controlling a superbly organized defense, and Menga did not stop between the active Conor Goldson and Joe Warrell.
The Rangers were an inspiration.
As long as Gerard and I had a good time, they fell well short of that standard.
Their last ball was a weather alarm for the Rangers, who once they--and it's a weather alarm for the Rangers who find themselves in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives a warm welcome in Cologne
When the Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for a meeting, there were smiles and blue skies on Saturday.
It was the last day of a controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, who is unable to mend ties between NATO allies.
They had disagreements over issues such as human rights, freedom suppression and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest number of expatriate Turks.
Police said they were trying to stop the 25,000 people who gathered in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters showed up nearby to meet the president.
Hundreds of pro-Erdogan protesters, including a large number of Kurds, also spoke out against Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The confrontation between the two protests reflects the dislike of German Turks who venerate Erdogan as a hero and those who sell him as a dictator.
Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:15am UK Summer Time on a complex road located to the south-east of Deptford around the junction of the Bestwood and Evelyn roads.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and the paramedics were on the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened months after another cyclist was killed in a Hudson accident in Childers, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
The London Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road was closed, bus routes were created, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officers injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the corrections department said.
A riot broke out at HMP Long Latin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 0930 UK Summer Time and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado guards are dealing with the riot, which involves eight inmates and one island occupied.
The prisoners were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A corrections spokesperson said that specially trained prison staff are being deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Latin.
Six of the employees were treated for their injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be called by the police and imprisoned for longer.
HMP Long Latin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
In June, there were reports that the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a riot police officer was called in to deal with a serious riot where an employee was attacked by a carpetbagger.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding.
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it's something that could happen next week as Hurricane Rosa conserves energy and crosses the southwest desert, bringing the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah.
Rosa is expected to land with rain late Monday and head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service tweeted, "Since 1950, only 10 tropical depressions have maintained tropical storm or subtropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!"
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center predicts 6 inches of rainfall in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona and 2 minutes and 4 inches in other areas.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are forecast to receive one-and-a-half inches of rain, with a separate chance of four inches.
In areas that are not at risk of flash flooding, the rain from Rosa may be a lucky break, as the area is suffering from drought.
Flooding is a very serious concern, but some of this rain could be beneficial, because the southwest is currently in a drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, at least the second-most dangerous category, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa lands on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico and crosses it.
Still a hurricane, Rosa, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
This storm will meet cold currents in the Pacific Ocean and weaken in intensity.
So, it's expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
There's a lot of rainfall throughout Mexico, so there's definitely a risk of flooding.
Rainfall of 3 minutes and 6 inches is expected in northwestern Sonora from Baja California, with up to 10 inches expected, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression by Tuesday morning, then travel through Arizona and up into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
The main danger expected from the loss of Lozana or its remnants is heavy rainfall that will spread across Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the deserts of the American southwest, the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods in the desert and mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton assault: four suspects charged with murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found on the Excelsior Terrace in Middlesbrough Norton at around 0400 hours on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital with a stable paralysis.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for anyone with cell phone photos of the scene before the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from Democratic rage and malignity.
"The vote for Judge Caberno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's disrespectful and absurd strategy", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cabrino was suffering from Democratic malice and anger during his appointment.
Caberno testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing about her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people saw Cabrino's extraordinary ability and courage that day.
"The confirmation vote for Judge Caberno is a vote that confirms that he is one of the most brilliant minds of justice of our time and a legal professional with a great record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cabrino's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
"We're only eight weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I wasn't running, but I was in a hurry.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates".
Trump claimed that Democrats were acting with the intent of harassment and disruption.
A senior Republican aide to the House leadership told CNN that the vote, the most important procedure in the House of Representatives for Cabrino's nomination, is expected to be held by Friday, if delayed.
Hundreds of deaths and more deaths predicted in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many washed away in huge waves that crushed the beach, officials said Saturday.
When a six-meter (18-foot) wave washed up on the beach near the end of the day, killing many people and destroying everything in front of them, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a celebration.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat from the tsunami hit, people continued their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, and they ended up becoming victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPM, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the ground, it hit the coast of Guam, it crossed the ocean at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour, it crossed the ocean at 497 mph", said Nugraho.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the Disaster Management Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges toppled and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The quake shook the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes was felt by 2.4 million people in one area.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy generated by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The statement said the city's terrain, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as a massive landslide, and he said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing, and that the bodies of some victims were found lying under the rubble of the collapsed building.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage were greater as it moved along the 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline north of Palu, called Donggala, closer to the epicenter.
The communications from Tunggala were completely paralyzed with no information, said Nguroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", the Red Cross said.
Authorities were blamed for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palou on Saturday, but officials said the waves hit within the time the warning was issued.
Amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantically to people down the street warning of an impending tsunami.
The water wall hits the beach and in a matter of minutes, it washes away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the scene.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive outage of communications around Fallu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military authorities have begun sending cargo trucks with relief supplies to Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but refugees still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport reopened for relief work only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was planning to visit the refuge in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll has soared to more than 800.
It's not very good.
World Vision staff from Donggala were safely evacuated to the city of Palu by a water barrier installed in the office yard, but they passed a devastating scene on the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's not very good.
As aid groups began to move in dismal fashion to help with disaster relief, some complained that skilled foreign aid workers were blocking their way to Fallu.
According to Indonesian regulations, material and human resources assistance from abroad can only begin to be provided if the area is declared a national disaster area.
The announcement hasn't been made yet.
"It's still a local disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can open up to international support, but we're not ready to do that yet".
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Fallu comes to a close, families and friends of those still missing are hopeful that a miracle will be performed to reverse the desperate story of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been lying under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has been training two of the missing paragliders from the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi and the others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his trainees.
"As a leader in para-gliding, I feel an emotional responsibility", he said.
Mr. Gendon told how the story was reported on the para-gliding slope after the news of the collapse of the Loa Loa Hotel, when he sent WhatsApp messages to the participants of the beach festival.
His message didn't get the blue check marks, but only one gray check mark.
It means that the text message was not sent.
Thieves in Newport on the Levee, while filling ATMs with cash, steal $26,750.
According to news reports from the Newport Police Department, a Brink employee was filling a cash machine in Newport-on-the-Lake on Friday morning with $26,750 stolen by thieves.
The driver of the car was preparing to empty an ATM in an amusement park and transfer more money, Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
While he was taking his seat, another man jumped up from behind the Pembroke employee and stole a suitcase full of money that should have been carried.
According to reports, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to exemplify.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was sometimes known by the nickname Yea, and used that name as the title of his eighth album, which is due out in mid-June.
The change came ahead of a performance on Saturday Night Live, where she was expected to introduce her new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who the show's producers said canceled her performance for emotional reasons.
In addition to the acronyms for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think that 'Yeshua' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible, it means 'You're Yeshua,'" West said earlier this year, talking to radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
"So I'm you, I'm us, and this is us.
It was a change from a canon to an example, which means one thing: our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
It's more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator Jay-Z is also either hyphenated or not.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed never to use the military against civilians.
As the 50th anniversary of the brutal retaliation against students approaches, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that he would not use the military to suppress Mexican citizens.
On October 2, 1968, in that square, the military fired on a peaceful protest, and as the leftist student movement began to take root throughout Latin America, it killed up to 300 people at a time.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly subsidies to those who study and by opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving the younger generation into organized crime.
The U.S. needs to double its A.I. funding.
As China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double its spending on research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, a researcher and AI expert who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comes after a series of announcements by various government departments about AI in the United States, where the overall AI strategy is lacking.
Meanwhile, China announced a plan last year to become the number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Considering that every other country is so far behind the United States, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we'll find the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Lee said in an interview with CNBCD this week that doubling funding would double the chances of the United States making the next big AI achievement.
Li's book, The Superpower of AI: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which is investing in Face++, one of China's most promising AI companies.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon, he did research on an AI system that beat the highest-ranking player in the United States, Othello, and later became head of Microsoft Research and head of Google's car division.
Lee knows about previous U.S. government technology competitions, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and he asked when the next competition would be to help identify the next prophet.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking out academic leaders, it's the company", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could help bolster the AI development efforts in the United States.
"I think that AI PhDs should be granted permanent residency automatically", he said.
China's State Council announced a plan for the development of China's next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds academic institutions in a similar way to how other government agencies, including the National Science Foundation, give small amounts of money to American researchers, but China has a low quality of academic work, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which was meant to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's investing $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
And as for NSF, NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been in limbo for months.
Macedonians hold referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonian citizens held a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has hampered its efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which used to be a province called Macedonia, has maintained an attitude that the name of its northern neighbor claims ownership of Greek territory, and is opposed to joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments saw a compromise based on the new name proposed in June, but opponents of the statehood claim that the name change would weaken Macedonia's ethnic characteristics of a predominantly Slavic population.
President Georgy Ivanov has said he will not vote in the general election, and opposition movements have questioned whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the general election to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper for the general election is: "Do you approve of the approval of the agreement with Greece and its membership in NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek membership in organizations like the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
He said that while he was not legally bound, he would have enough members of Congress follow the vote to confirm the results.
A name change requires a two-thirds majority vote in Congress.
The Central Election Commission said that no fraud was reported until 1 p.m.
But the turnout has stalled at just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last congressional election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
On 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, together with his wife Zorica and son Dushko, voted in a referendum on the change of Macedonia's national emblem, which would pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small performance in front of the parliament building in Strumicka, lifting up a tent chair set up by people opposed to the general election.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them in a fair way, not through the back door", said Kabardakov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, they can turn their heads to other countries like China and Russia and be part of the European-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Joev said that NATO membership would bring more support to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority of people will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our people are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Jozef after casting his vote.
He said that the results of the Centennial would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian polling agency found that 30 to 43 percent of voters said they would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of course, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, we need one more vote in 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum would be seen as a serious blow to a pro-Western government for the first time since he took power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City takes over the entire Brighton defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly took over the Brighton defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero scored what seemed like an easy goal in the 65th minute.
This Argentine striker got a pass from midfield at the same time as the start of the sequence.
He was able to squeeze through three of Brighton's defenders and then he jumped onto the open court.
And then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender to the edge of the penalty box in Brighton before being kicked a few more times.
Then he found Sterling and passed to his left.
The English forward used the first touch from the penalty box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to kick to the right of the net to fight off Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"I saw Aguero struggling with a problem with his foot", said Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.
"We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what actually happened.
And we were lucky that he scored".
But the man who scored the first goal for the Sky Blues in that Premier League game was a different Sterling.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Archie got the ball from deep in Brighton's zone in that game.
He passed a stunning pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sneed touched a few times before Sterling moved toward the goalpost farther away.
The Sky Blue forward put the ball in the net before it slipped out of the boundary.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Hoffenheim and Gensheim in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer wants a spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoff debate, there's little reason to lead another start.
But the most competitive Schürzer wants to take the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there's still a playoff opportunity for the Rockies, who are beating the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in the NL West.
The Rockies won the Nationals Friday night 5-2 and earned at least one wild-card spot, but the Rockies are still looking for a way to defend their first regional title.
Even if we play without any results, at least we can get our feet on the pitch with the audience here in Denver, knowing the atmosphere, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I'll ever face this year.
Why would I want to compete in that?
The Nationals haven't announced a start yet on Sunday, but reports suggest that it was Schürer's turn to pitch in that situation.
Schürzer, who is making his 34th start, will pitch Thursday in the buffering session, and on Sunday, he will pitch as usual.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 on the season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, he indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the president's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as attorney general.
"Everything we've done is up to November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important votes of our lives.
This is one of the really, really big ones. I'm not running, but I'm in a hurry, and that's why I go everywhere to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've seen this terrible, terrible radical Democratic Party, you've seen what's happening right now.
And they decided to use all the means necessary to take back power, and you saw the evil, the disgust.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to attack to gain power and dominance.
He said that Democrats are moving to cause resistance and disruption.
"And you've seen over the last four days, he's been calling Democrats "scum, dirty, disgusting, untrustworthy".
He referred to the House Judiciary Committee, citing the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, whose name was heard in the audience as a huge hoot.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you see the document?
Oh, my God.
No, no, no. I'm waiting. It was really bad body language. It was the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a nationalist party.
It's not acceptable to people who tell their stories.
It was almost unsurprising that activists from my local political party, Momentum, voted to discipline me.
After all, I was the last person to hear that they were not welcome in the Labour MPs' ranks, and it was all about letting our innermost selves out.
My fellow Congresswoman Joan Ryan was treated similarly because of her steadfast resistance to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for having a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, ironically, are the same issues that Jeremy had a disagreement with his predecessors.
And on Friday, at the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, we had this statement:
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that Friday night board meeting was exactly that.
Sadly, today, many of the conversations don't reflect the social paradigm, and the promise of a kinder, more decent food policy is forgotten, if that promise even began.
It's becoming increasingly clear that different views are not accepted in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged by whether they are accepted by the leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a Democrat, when colleagues who thought they had the same political views as me started to expect me to change my mind or take a political position that I would never have otherwise supported on national security issues or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I said, I was accused of being a centrist and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party, and I was getting a lot of criticism on social media, calling for my next general election to be cancelled.
And it's not my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments made against me tended to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who never shy away from the sexual and racial discrimination that is rampant every day.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current regime is the way that all kinds of insults are normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a multinational party, and all the unconfident, unconscious consent or change of preference is making the party more biased.
I've heard a lot of advice over the past year that if you don't avoid attention-grabbing behavior and you don't make your case too strongly, you're going to be fine.
But that's not what I wanted to do in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, angered by the Thatcher government's indifference to letting a literally inclusive school classroom collapse, I have pursued a fight for better public services for those in need.
I have never hidden my political views, not once, including the last election.
No one in the House has ever been confused about my policy stance and the areas where I'm at odds with the current leadership.
All I can say to those who started to disagree on Friday is that I cannot understand the sense of wasting time and energy trying to show loyalty to the Labour Party leader as the country heads for a Brexit that will damage homes, industries and public services.
But really, the one message I want to send is not to the House momentum, but to my constituency, whether Labour or not, where I am proud to contribute to you, and no threat of impeachment or political pressure will stop you from doing what you believe is best for all of us.

♪ Ayr ♪ 38-17 Melrose: ♪ The undefeated Ayr goes to the top ♪
The last two attempts were a draw, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the great and exciting Tennent's Premiership game that day.
The ten undefeated players were in the lead.
In the end, it was a good defense, as well as a good shot, which was brought to the home side by manager Peter Mulch, which made everyone happy.
We've finished the test with a game to this point, and we've still never won, so I'm happy", he said.
And Robyn Christie of Melos said, "The Cougars did a good job, they took a better chance than our team did".
14th minute: Grant Anderson's Troy and Frazier Climo's Converted led the air, but Scottish captain Rory Hughes received a yellow card and as the game tipped in the Warriors' favor, Melos allowed an opportunity and Jason Baggot caught the unconverted Troy.
Climo reached out to give Air the lead on the penalty kick, and just before halftime, he scored, and then he switched to a solo trio to save Air from a 17-5 deficit.
But Melrose started to do well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's try and a conversion goal from the batter-for-all made it a five-point loss on the leafy.
The game was then delayed for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transferred to a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr opened the scoring gap sharply with a try from Stafford McDowall and a conversion goal from Climo.
Air's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card at the time, and Melrose added additional personnel in exchange for Bruce Colvine's conversion goal from the Tribe after intense pressure.
But they came back to the home side, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling a ballless Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown before Air Maul.
Climo scored a convertible, which he did after Kyle Rowe collected a box kick from David Armstrong and Gregor Henry sent home a fifth try, scoring again from the start.

The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last of the show's run, and Kieran seems to be preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but sources in the Scottish Sun suggest that Keiran was involved in a business promotion scheme with the Glasgow restaurant.
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the chair-like naval base in La Paz.
There's a sea flag flying over a public building.
The names of the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are engraved on the left:
It's our duty to take it back".
Throughout Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of losing a coastline in a 19th-century resource conflict with Chile is still vivid, and so we long to sail the Pacific once more.
With Bolivia awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations, that hope may have reached its peak in decades.
"There is a momentum, a unity and a calmness in Bolivia, and of course we have positive expectations for the results", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the International Court of Justice's ruling on a big screen, hoping to side with Bolivia's claim that Chile has an obligation to negotiate for Bolivia to allow independent access to the sea after decades of one-off meetings in The Hague.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who has been battling for re-election next year, is also relying heavily on Monday's ruling.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts believe the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that doesn't change much.
This Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to award Chilean territory, and it has stated that it will not decide the outcome of any possible talks.
The last debate on this matter was not a fluke, and the International Court of Justice's ruling is only six months away.
We can go back to the last four years, far from the causes of Bolivia.
"The problem of access to the sea is currently being exploited by the Bolivian administration", said Zarate.
She argued that Morales's offensive words were also losing favor with the rest of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at the appropriate time, but I think it will be very difficult to continue the conversation after this.
The two countries haven't sent ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, was surprisingly quick to reject the idea that the court's decision was a decision.
On Monday, he said, he would give Bolivia a new horizon in its relationship with the Panchala, a chance to end 139 years of disagreement with the Panchala and its interests.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the ocean as a political tool.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to show that we need to move on from the past".
He says there's no denuclearization until North Korea can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that if North Korea cannot trust the US government, it will never be the first to disarm.
He said that on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to continue to honor the promises made by the leaders of both countries during their summit in Singapore.
His remarks were delivered to the United States, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be looking to restart a nuclear policy that had been stalled for more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
This is the continuing sanctions and the U.S. opposition to declaring an end to the Korean War, which is a way of ultimately trying to bring about the submission of North Korea.
The U.S. government is of the view that it is prudent to agree to the declaration unless North Korea first makes a meaningful disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But because North Korea sees weapons as the only way to ensure its security, there is widespread skepticism about whether North Korea is serious about giving up its weapons.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show unveils its latest line of giant headwear that will take you from the city center to the heart of the city.
If you want to expand your hat collection or block out the sun completely, you don't need to look at anything else.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne unveiled a slew of killer oversized hats on the runway of their eye-catching SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unrealistic hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers are putting their amazing creations on stage.
What stood out from Valentino was a beige hat with a wide-brimmed hat decorated with feathers covering the model's head.
Other oversized aquariums had jewel-encrusted water lilies and witch hats and even pineapples, but they weren't designed to make your head spin.
Tom Brown also released a curious mask selection, which is just in time for Halloween.
A large number of the masks, in different colors, had lip seams, and they looked more like Hannibal Rector than they did outcourt.
One looks like scuba diving gear with a snook and goggles, while another looks like a melted ice cream.
And if you're going to keep making these huge fashion statements, you're in luck.
Style observers predicted that a giant bonnet would reach from the center to you.
The hat that was hot on the heel of La Bomba, the one with the three-foot-wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The brand, which has passionate fans, has taken the very unrealistic hat that has been a social media sensation to the limelight, and has launched another giant creation on the shelves: a straw beach bag that's almost as big as a model in a bathing suit with a briefcase.
The painted orange lapia back, decorated with a lapia fringe and a white ladder handle tower, was a highlight of Jacques's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL that he expects to see the wide hat and beachback arrive in the downtown area next summer, and it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized handbags given the designer's influence.
John Edward: Language skills are essential skills as global citizens.
Private schools in Scotland are maintaining their academic excellence record, and that performance is leading to excellent test scores in 2018, which are improving individual and overall success in sports, art, music and other areas where we've worked hard.
These schools, which have a population of over 30,000 students across Scotland and are represented by the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to students and parents.
Private schools are designed to prepare students for adult education and higher education, their chosen careers, and their status as global citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement tailored school curricula, we are seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and preferred choice subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak in a language that a dog understands, it will go into his head".
If you speak his language, it will be engraved on his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
If you look at the most recent test results this year, language is ranked first in the league with the highest pass rate in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied a foreign language got A's, all high grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received A's in Mandarin, 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also received A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will need in the future.
Today, languages are being considered as a subject of choice in independent school curricula, and in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers blame their struggles to fill gaps on a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
As more and more jobs are created in the future that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever profession you choose, learning a second foreign language will give you a substantial advantage over having this lifelong skill.
When you can communicate directly with people from abroad, you automatically have a multilingual competitor.
A 2013 YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75% were not conversational enough in a foreign language, with French being the only language spoken at a two-digit rate of 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in language education for kids today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will give kids a better chance of finding meaningful careers.
Within Scotland, the languages taught in each school will be different.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, and others will teach the languages that are considered the most important in the UK as we look ahead to 2020, like Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, with a faculty who is an expert in the field, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in an independent school.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing learning environments that prepare children for anything in the future and provide them with the skills they need to succeed.
In the global business environment, there's no denying that language continues to be a very important part of the future of a country, and this needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide these choices, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's the right thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron, debuting with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the LA Lakers is almost over.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet decided how many minutes he'll play.
On the Lakers' official website, Walton said, "It's going to be more than one minute, less than 48 minutes".
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that it looks like James will be playing for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James got a question about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
He said, "You don't need a preseason game at this point to prepare".
Trump's time of the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a tax raid tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week for President Trump, including in friendly areas like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy on hold, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the November vote puts the Republicans in danger of losing control of Congress.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's Wheeling rally in West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Below, you can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cabrino, who is nervous about sexual harassment allegations, as he postpones a Senate confirmation vote for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain some leverage in the run-up to the November election.
According to Reuters, the Trump campaign's fifth rally next week aims to "empower volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the Republican Party's key areas in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
A Trump campaign spokesman, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters in an interview, "The president will visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign season because congressional control is so important to his agenda".
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally, which will take place tonight at the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, will draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be covered by Pittsburgh media.
This is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, which won by more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, "The fact that the president has to come to the polls to get his way is not a good sign for Morrissey".
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows courage to fight to keep their hopes up for Sunday's singles.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's Fossum game may be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The wobbly momentum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but it's a concept that athletes truly believe in, and nowhere does it make more sense than in this competition.
So where is the momentum now?
Coach Jordan Spieth walked out today and said, "They're up six points and now they're four, so I think they've gotten a little bit of momentum".
And of course, Europe is 12 points ahead of the rest of the game, four points ahead.
As Spears said, Americans think there's a little bit of wind in the air, and that's enough to lift them up, especially Spears and Justin Thomas, who not only play together all day, but they're boasting four to three points each.
Speeds were lethal from tee to green, and we're ahead of the curve.
As his round progressed, the cheers grew louder, and as he and Thomas were losing twice after losing twice, he hit a crucial putt to tie Game 4.
In his portrait, leading them to victory in the 15-day game, he shouted a cry that seemed to say he believed the American team was not yet out of the game.
Spears said, "You have to really dig deep and worry about your game".
Now all these players are gone.
The 18th hole makes the score.
The only players to score more points than Spears and Thomas in the last two years are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indisputable story in the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple can't go wrong with four to four.
The Mummywoods were the only couple who didn't show up on Saturday afternoon, but they didn't show up on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon and Friday morning at 9:00.
That flow and the energy that flows to them from this overwhelming crowd confirms that they are the champions on Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to block a potential European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari as Le Golf National gets sunny.
I'd rather be in different halls both at the same time.
But the story of Europe's glory is a time-honored one.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson teamed up with Alex Noren to create a short film about the morning football hero Sergio Garcia.
On the front nine holes, with one look and two doubles, the Spaniards and the Swedes had a solo they could never get out of.
But on Sundays, no one will help you out of the hall.
Popball and possum are fun to watch closely because of the interaction between the players, the suggestions they make, the suggestions they don't make, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has been better as a team so far, and they've been leading until the last day, but this Fossum game showed that some of the American teams, especially the American side, have the guts to fight a fight that they've been suspicious of.
Europe 10-6 ahead of the Ryder Cup final.
Europe will be in a very good position to advance to the Ryder Cup final after beating the United States 10-6 in the football and foosball matches on Saturday.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the excitement with a second win over Tiger Woods, who has struggled to add four points to his record so far at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, overwhelmingly beat the United States in the morning volleyball match to regain the trophy they had stolen from Hazelstein two years earlier, and took the series 3-1.
The United States won two games in Phosm, and they fought hard, but they couldn't keep up.
Jim Furyk's team can keep the trophy if they score eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday.
Fleetwood had their first four-point season as a European rookie, but they and Molinari, dubbed the "Mollywood Cup" after their breakout weekend, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four games.
In the foil, Woods and Patrick Reed beat Woods, who was a perfect match, and Bryson Dechambeau, a much stronger American rookie, by 5&4.
Woods, who played two games in a row on Saturday, has sometimes been spectacular, but he's now lost 19 of his 29 games at Pobol and Fosum, seven of them in a row.
After taking a break for football this morning, Justin Rose returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Fossum match, losing 2&1 to world number one and third-ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
Despite the sunny, glamorous days in southwest Paris, Europe didn't have it their own way.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points on Saturday.
They won a landslide 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the foil, then came back to lose their opening two holes in the foil, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3.
Although Fury's team would have to go through a draw to defend the trophy, they are only the second team in Ryder Cup history to come back from a four-point deficit in singles.
But after two days of second place, Sunday's rebound looks like it's going to be even better.
North Korea, unilateral disarmament without trust is impossible.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued sanctions on the United Nations were deepening mistrust of the United States, and that there was no way North Korea could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "serious friendly measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "But I don't see the American response to that".
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we don't have confidence in our national security, and in that case, we can't unilaterally disarm first".
While Foreign Minister Lee echoed familiar North Korean grievances over U.S. resistance to a gradual denuclearization of North Korea, which would be rewarded by taking gradual steps, his remarks were significant in that North Korea did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had in the past.
Foreign Minister Lee said that during the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 December, Kim Jong-un made a joint statement pledging to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and that Trump had promised North Korean security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War since 1950-53, but the United States has said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States also rejected calls for a relaxation of the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
Foreign Minister Lee said, "The United States insists on denuclearization as a priority, and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals through coercive means, even opposing declarations of war".
"The idea that restraint can bring us to our knees is the fantasy of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that our mistrust is deepening with the continuing sanctions".
Li did not comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which he highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Chairman Kim and President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding, "If the parties to this denuclearization issue were not the United States, but South Korea, then denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a stalemate".
Even so, the tone of Liang Ho's speech was clearly different from the one he delivered at the UN General Assembly last year, when President Xi Jinping, after Trump had labeled Kim as a "rocket man" for carrying out a suicide mission, declared that North Korea's missile attack on the US mainland was inevitable.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Chairman Kim at the UN this year for his courageous efforts to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions needed to be maintained until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said, "It doesn't matter if it's two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia claim that they should compensate Pyongyang for the actions taken by the UN security forces.
But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking at the U.N. Security Council on the third day, said, "We must continue to enforce security sanctions vigorously until we achieve complete and final denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Secretary Pompeo said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit after meeting with Foreign Minister Lee on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
Secretary Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not smooth.
He left Pyongyang in July with the news of progress, but within hours, North Korea accused him of "screwing up demands".
North Korea has promised to dismantle its missile sites and nuclear sites if the United States takes "retaliatory measures" in a meeting with President Moon Jae-in.
He said that Kim had delivered "response" in Singapore, including the security measures promised by President Trump and the move to normalize relations with the United States.
Harvard students go to class to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is helping all undergraduates get better sleep to combat the growing marijuana culture that is fueled by caffeine-addicted "OnNite".
One scholar found that students at the world's top universities often don't know the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed this course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the class, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you teaching this now that you're a senior?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
This is the first year of this course, which teaches students how good sleep habits help with academics and athletics, and how important they are for promoting overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said the university found that students experienced severe sleep deprivation during the week and decided to introduce the process.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a picture of a dorm where students can click on a coffee mug, curtains, a trainer, a book and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects physical activity and the importance of a routine.
In another chapter, participants learned how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their daily routine.
"We know that it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Chesler added.
He added that the culture of pride about "sleeping late" still exists, and that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said that sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, and it makes you feel hungry all the time, so it should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue, anxiety, even if it's to prevent weight gain.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student in California, helped design this course when Professor Chesler was teaching one of his classes last year at Harvard University during his freshman year.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to push it across campus.
The next step is to require all graduate students to complete a similar learning program before entering a competing institution.
Prof. Keisler recommends that students consider setting alarms to tell them when to go to bed and when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can take your cycle out of its normal rhythm and cause sleep problems.
The goal of Menga knocks Gerrard's men down.
Rangers suffered another round of midfield depression when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard down 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was trying to pick up its first win since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat the Ladbrokes Premier League leaders, who were out of control with Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, to eight points.
Seven minutes into the first half, the men's game was full, and the lineup didn't look very good for the Rangers' inspiration.
Rangers dropped to sixth, but Livingston moved up to third, only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And the Rangers could have a bigger problem because Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after being hit by a distant object.
Gerard has made eight changes to the side that has swept them to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup over the past year.
Meanwhile, Holt went with Libby 11, who beat Hartz's score last week, and he would have been delighted to see his well-pierced suit suffocate their opponent every time.
The Rangers may have taken possession, but Livingston did more when he had the ball.
They had a first strike by Menga that passed Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor, but the midfielder had to score in just two minutes to take his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free throw found captain Craig Halkett, but defensive partner Alan Lithgow took a big stab in the back.
The Rangers gained control, but they seemed more hopeful than they had been in the last three games.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he should have received a 15-minute penalty when he collided with Steven Thomson, but the referee dismissed the Colombian appeal.
Rangers were held to two half-centuries, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly suffered a head injury from a header by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's 34th-minute opening may have been against the game, but no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts.
Once again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep Jacobs set piece.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher scored against Scott Robinson, and kept his composure by choosing a men's for a simple finish.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that substitution made an almost immediate impact as Morelos' winger scored, but Kelly was impressive and ran from his line to block.
But Livingston had Riscoe and Halkett take a long pass after a long tie, and keep the audience sucking in exactly the kind of game they enjoy.
Holt could have extended the lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Riscoe headed into the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton called for a penalty kick against Jacobs, but Thompson again sidelined.
The inventor of the Geiger counter.
On a page of the Sunday Morning calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive material, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Coefficient.
The Geiger coefficient, which has been at the center of science ever since, also became a popular culture reference in the 1950 film The Bell of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as the unlikely cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger coefficient used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
And if you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms being emitted by the radiation of the mineral".
"Oh, it's definitely going to explode!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the inventions that bear his name remain.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see the malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill malignant cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as targets to treat.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the lab.
And they can see and inject back into many cancers the proteins that are common.
The experimental vaccine is showing promising results in a variety of cancer patients.
One woman who received this vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear in over 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the lab, and then "re-injecting" the cells into a protein common to many cancers called HER2.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
"HER2 promotes the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer", explains Professor Burzhowski.
A similar approach to "teaching" how to take immune cells from patients and target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West, after wearing a MAGA hat and appearing on SNL, began to make pro-Trump accusations.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West performed a tribute to Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live and was booed in the studio after announcing his 2020 presidential campaign.
That evening, after writing "Make America Great Cap" and singing a third song, "Ghost Town", he continued his angry outcry against the Democrats, and renewed his support for Trump.
"I've told this story to white people quite a few times, and they say, 'How can you like Trump when he's a racist?'"
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL started with a drama starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, West's ranting scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time backstage about what he had written in his head.
"They were harassing me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on".
They're harassing me!
And they say I'm in the sinking position", said the Washington examiner.
And West goes on to say, "Would you like to see where it's gone?" And he says, "I'm going to wear my Superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Make love to me".
Variety reported that his comments had caused outrage from audiences at least twice, and that SNL's cast seemed to be in a state of panic, with one person saying, "The whole studio went silent".
West was hired late to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with his fairy tale-shaped performance of "I Love It".
West was backed by Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to the violence".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply said, "Who she is, that's amazing".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone I think embraces and instills harmful ideals into our society by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his 'art.'
He's free.
And so are we".
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the man now officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change their name and follow Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, Peddie.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg went by the name Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to symbolize, and then became the artist formerly known as Prince.
He's charged with attempted murder in the Belfast restaurant shooting.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is due to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Those charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington is taking a man's beauty to the next level.
Keith Herrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones, as a sword wielder.
But the 31-year-old actor shattered stereotypes about macho heroes, saying that such roles in films often mean that young boys feel they have to struggle to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he "believes something is wrong", raising questions about how to address the toxic problem of masculinity in the #mytho era.
Recently married to his "Game of Thrones" co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Keith admitted that he feels "very strongly" about dealing with this issue.
"I personally feel quite strongly, where did we see masculinity wrong?" he said.
"In terms of the problem we're facing, what have we taught men growing up?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to masculine characters.
He went on, "What is innate and what is learned?
What is it about TV and the streets that makes young boys feel like they should be men?
I think that's one of the biggest problems of our time. How do we change it?
Because, obviously, something is wrong with the young people".
In the interview, he also hinted that he was "over the battlefield and the horses" and that he would not be doing Game of Thrones or a sequel when the series ended next summer.
Starting in November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's True West: Resurrection, the story of his brother, filmmaker and bandit.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so the drama gave me a future family and a life from here", he said.
Rose played Egrit, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% spike in new cases
China announced that the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases reported.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, which shows that things are different than in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood.
But Chinese health officials said at a conference in Winan that the number of people infected with HIV in this way has almost halved.
But the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 a year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a hot topic in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is rampant.
Because of the conservative values in this country, studies have estimated that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmission of disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies the employees leaked the information of Republican senators and blasts "dangerous lies and propaganda".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday accused her staff of publishing the personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia.
A Democratic congressman in Los Angeles claimed that the claims were being made by "far-right" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Lies, lies, more vile lies".
The information released included the home address and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah and Orrin Hatch.
The information was reportedly posted online by an unidentified person during a Senate hearing on Thursday on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill.
This leak came after three senators questioned Caberno.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that verified the source of the post was associated with Waters' office, and Hill reported that Waters had released information from an employee.
Waters claimed, "This baseless claim is completely false and absolutely false".
"No member of my staff whose identity, privacy, and security were compromised by this fraudulent and false allegation was ever responsible for this leak.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false".
Waters' statement was criticized online, and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer agreed.
Fleischer wrote, "I am angry at this denial".
"This suggests that she is not strong enough to be a member of parliament.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They shouldn't rebel.
They should not question the motives of the whistleblower.
They need to be calm and calm".
Fleisher appeared to compare Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Caberno, who was accused by commentators of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who ran to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
He tweeted, "It's a big deal if it's true".
Waters said in a statement, "We are alerting the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies to this fraudulent allegation".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed", he added, "and they will be held legally accountable for any behavior that could destroy and endanger all of my employees".
Johnny English Strike reviews - The lowdown on Rowan Arkinson spy parody
It's now traditional to look for the Brexit crisis in any new film with a British perspective, and this seems to apply to the revival of the Channy English action comedy parody franchise, which began in 2003 with Channy English and was revived in 2011 with Channy English Ribbon.
Will a joke that makes fun of ourselves about how obviously we are trash become a new export opportunity for our country?
Anyway, the big-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had the ability to create something more novel than anything he had ever seen, a vast comedy created for non-English-speaking film fans.
Of course, he's a young, undercover agent with a little bit of clownish charm, despite his bizarre appearance, and he's got the Mr. Bean edge, and he's the one who contributed a note to the opening theme song for the 2012 London Olympics, the Chariot of Fire.
He also appeared once in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, which based the original traveler and internationally mysterious figure Arkinson, confusing his career.
There are a couple of great moments in this English-language outing.
I was happy to see Johnny English approach the helicopter, briefly banging his medieval armor and rotating wings on his helmet.
While we can see Dickinson's talent for physical comedy, his humor feels rather restrained and strangely exaggerated, especially since "sensitive" film brands like 007 or Mission Impossible are now confidently offering comedy as a feature.
It's almost as if the humor is aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, the deadly thinking of Johnny English is as creative and unfocused as the way that the silent film of Dickinson is in the character of Vin.
The current permanent thematic assumption is that Britain is in serious trouble.
By hacking into the secret British spy web network, exposing the identities of every British agent in the field, a cyber hacker has disappointed Kevin Elden, who unfortunately plays a small role.
This is the final nail in the coffin of a haughty, self-absorbed prime minister who is already experiencing a complete collapse of political popularity.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since all active spies are at risk, she will have to recruit someone who is retired.
And that means that while Johnny English himself is now employed as a teacher at some fancy facility, he's giving informal classes on how to become a masked publicist.
English rushes back to the White House for an emergency briefing, reuniting with his former assistant, Bowe, reprised by Ben Miller.
Now a widower, he is married to Vicki Pepperdine, a passionate athlete and unfortunate casting director for the role of a submarine commander.
So Batman and Robin, who had gone horribly wrong in their work in Her Majesty's secret guard, were brought back to life when they met Olga Kurylenko's beautiful wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the waterfront is in danger of collapsing due to demands from charismatic technology billionaire Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Beau begin their journey of ironic play, disguised as waiters, setting fires in fancy French restaurants, smuggling in Volta's luxury yacht, and English creates a puzzle board of his own as he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get used to the interior of Volta's house.
For that last scene, all the scenes were definitely flowing, but as much as I was happy and babbling about it, it was like a children's TV.
Pretty decent, you know.
And like other shitty English films, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Arkinson a role that really matched his talent?
I'm not saying that Labour in Britain is planning to work four days a week and get paid for five.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan to see Britons work four days a week and get paid five.
According to reports, the Labor Party hopes that CEOs will use the savings made by the AI revolution to make their workers' days easier.
It's going to see employees enjoy a three-day weekend, but still take home the same paycheck.
Sources said the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and a plan to turn the country to the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "We expect a policy review to be published before the end of the year.
"It may not happen in a day, but the four-day workweek is a part of the Party's approach to economic restructuring that benefits workers and fits with the Party's overall industrial strategy".
With the Green Party pledging a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election, Labour may not be the first to support such a proposal.
But that is not the ambition that the whole Labour Party is currently supporting.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a policy and is not a consideration in the party".
The shadow cabinet of John McDonnell used the Labour Party meeting last week to articulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he decided to take back power from the faceless directors and producers at the public companies.
The shadow cabinet's plan also means that the Labour government could be 'primed' for misconduct, so the current shareholders of the water company may not get their full shares back.
He also planned to put workers on the company's board and create a comprehensive ownership fund to give employees 10 percent of the shares in private companies, so that employees would get up to £500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the impeachment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI's findings will shake up Republican senators and draw their support.
Scott Pelley, 60 Minutes reporter, asked Republican Senators in an interview aired Sunday if John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham could come up with anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleagues in South Carolina.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I told him I had talked to Judge Caberno about going to the jury.
I called him after the incident, and when the charges were filed, I said, "Did you?"
He was firm, subdued, and clear.
But Graham's vote seems to be decisive.
He said that the Winger decided on Brett Cabrino, and that it would require a huge amount of criticism.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it emphatically, and Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone she nominated could verify that.
I'm 36 years old.
I don't see anything new.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual music event featuring incredibly impressive stars on an equally important mission: to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Poverty Project, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that hopes to increase the number of people actively fighting poverty and ending it.
To get free admission to the event (unless they pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing, calling world leaders, or devising other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful have the last 12 years been in achieving their goals as Global Citizens?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a real way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another example of so-called cliquetisms that feel like they're making a real difference by signing online petitions or tweeting?
Global Citizens says it has received more than 19 million "actions" from supporters since 2011 and is pushing for other causes.
These actions, he said, have helped world leaders announce more than $37 billion in pledges and policies that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group cited 390 pledges and announcements that began with that action in early 2018, of which at least $10 billion had already been spent or funded.
The organization estimates that the funds raised so far have directly impacted approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is the Power of Nutrition, a partnership of British investors and practitioners that says, "Help children reach their full potential", and pledged 35 million dollars to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social inequality of malnutrition a historic issue", said Tracy Ullman, the ambassador for the power of nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition that could provide nutritional interventions to five million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, "What do you think will help us end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens responded: "It's going to be a long and hard road, and sometimes we're going to fall or fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement before it, we will win, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cady B, Janelle Monáe will perform at the event, which is being held in New York City this year and is hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could be used as a "barrier" to Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
As quoted by the Washington investigator, Washington can rely on the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the market, including in the Middle East, if necessary, said Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Jinke argued that Russia's intervention in Syria, which is being conducted at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a way to open up a new energy market.
He was quoted as saying, "I think they're in the Middle East to broker energy, just like they are in southern and eastern Europe".
And, according to the source, there are ways and means to solve it.
He said, "The United States has the ability to work with our Navy to open up the sea lanes, blockade if necessary, and keep their energy from going to market".
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He compared the US approach to Russia and Iran, and he said that Russia and Iran are basically the same.
He referred to Russia as a trick ponytail for a fossil fuel-dependent economy, and said, "The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace some fuels".
The announcement comes as the Trump administration carries out its mission to increase LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia as a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the ambitious Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a dumping ground for Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which aims to double the capacity of the existing pipeline, to 110 billion square meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the United States' fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in September in Moscow after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, "We share the recognition that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier".
The U.S. position drew a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the plan.
Germany's leading industrial group, the BDI, has urged the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, president of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), said, "We have a big problem when third countries interfere with our energy supply".
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts says she will be cautious if she runs for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she would be "sad" if she ran for president after 25 days of midterm elections.
In a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
Congress says, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and women have risen to the top", she said.
"After November 6, I will be considering running for president".
Warren was evaluating President Donald Trump at the town hall, saying that Trump was leading the county in the wrong direction.
She said, "I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy".
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and the nominees for the Supreme Court, Brett Cabernet.
Warren tweeted Friday, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
A Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll found that 58 percent of the voters in Massachusetts who are likely to vote for Trump said that the senator should not run.
32 percent supported such a nomination.
The poll showed that Deval Patrick was more likely to support the former governor's candidacy, with 38% in favor and 48% against.
Other celebrities discussed in connection with the 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, AP reports.
Sarah Palin quotes from a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) speech by Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Pelline, 26, joined the Army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
She said at a rally in support of Donald Trump's candidacy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, today, "What my son is going through, what he's coming back to, I can empathize with PTSD and other families who feel some of the wounds our soldiers have suffered".
Pelline called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of her son and other veterans, "They come back a little different, come back stiff, come back wondering if their fellow soldiers, their air force, and all the other military people have any respect for what they've given to their country".
Dan Bennett, a Wasilla police spokesman, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women and obstructing a report of drunken possession of a weapon.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to a new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and counties submitted court-ordered pleas to Washington on Friday in support of refugees who oppose the policy.
The full name of the August lawsuit, Grace v. Sessions, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not yet been released.
She said she was abused by her partner, Kim, and the sons of the gangsters, Kim, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where many U.S. asylum seekers live, as countries plagued by gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the U.S. Congress to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The attorney general of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores 30 years of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such state law violates that principle", the court's opinion noted.
Lawyers also argued in the lawsuit that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, making them more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang attacks.
Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11 that "people who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion may seek asylum".
Asylum was not meant to alleviate all the problems that people around the world face every day, even all the serious problems.
Fatal rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in the race for survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforts her son in a devastated shelter in the city of Palu, saying, "I'm very nervous".
"Every minute an ambulance is bringing in a body.
There's no clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for their own belongings and trying to salvage everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Pallu Army Hospital where patients were being treated in the open air with severe injuries.
He burst into tears as he recalled the tremors that shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he lived with his wife and daughter.
I didn't have time to save myself.
"I think I'm being sucked into the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I just hope they're okay.
I'm suing China for harassing the American ambassador with propaganda.
The US ambassador accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda just a week after China's official newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily for the mutual benefit of US-China trade.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday in Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, about the subsidies paid by ChinaDaily after it accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to interfere in the US election has prompted US officials to point to what they said in an interview with Reuters as Washington's new face to pressure China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, China and the United States are currently locked in a heated trade war, seeing each other impose tariffs on their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China said the retaliatory tariffs were aimed at hitting major exporters like China, which supported Trump's Republican Party and Chinese and American experts.
US Ambassador to the United States and Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, a major exporter of Chinese agricultural products, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a commentary published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China "is now doubling down on harassment by advertising propaganda for our own free press".
Branstad wrote, "The Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of the press and expression that America cherishes to promote propaganda by publishing paid ads in the Des Moines Register".
He wrote, "In contrast, you will find limited opposition in the newspaper media here in Beijing, and it will not reflect at all the heterogeneous views that the Chinese have about the economic trajectory that should be of concern given that the media are firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party".
He added that his article was "avoided by one of the leading Chinese newspapers", but did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are leading the Kavanaugh Debacle, excluding centrist women voters, analysts warn.
While many Republican leaders are backing and defending the Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing sexual assault charges, analysts warn that he will face a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment around this has been extremely heated, and it shows that most Republicans already want to go ahead with the vote.
"These things can't be undone", said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, referring to an article published Saturday in Congress.
Lehrer said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona,'s latest crackdown on the FBI investigation would be enough to sway angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, no, not even in November", the chief counsel and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn said Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, when the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to force Cabrino's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters entered evidence in the Senate corridor and shouted, "November is coming!"
"The passion and deceit of the Democratic Party is slipping out of the popularity rankings", said nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg on the news site.
The people of the state say they've already recorded high numbers: right.
But it was especially high among the suburban, floating-class women voters who didn't like the president but didn't vote often, and among young voters between 18 and 29".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominee, there was speculation that a Republican congressman could be backlashed if he violated the endorsement.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, "This is a messy situation for the Republican Party".
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, whether Cabrino gets to be on the bench, it's about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they handled her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democratic lawmakers, told the news channel.
But based on the testimony of Ford and Cabrino, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided on who to believe.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents said they believed Ford's testimony, definitely or probably, while 35 percent said they believed Cabrino, definitely or probably.
And 38 percent said they thought Cabrino lied during his testimony, and 30 percent said they thought he lied about Ford.
The FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, following the investigation into Plake, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified last week before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that Cabrino had drunk and assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claimed that a Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party in the 1980s while studying at Yale.
The creator of the World Wide Web Plans, started a new Internet to acquire Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon, Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access what information.
In a one-on-one interview with Fast Company, Barnes Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "world domination".
He said about startups, "We have to do it now.
"This is a historic moment".
This app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, schedule management, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of private online data warehouses is that it's entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information they can access.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and appropriate technology to help everyone use Solid products.
The company now consists of a security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some field developers contracted to work on this project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can use the tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own distributed apps.
Berners Lee and his team said they're not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they're going to bring about a complete change in their entire business model, where they're going to completely upgrade overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on commercial energy and solid.
In 1994, Barnes Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Barnes Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over pure neutrality.
Even while he's starting Inrupt, Barnes Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", added Lee.
Bernard Vann: World War I Victorian Crusader Memorial
The only Anglican priest to win a battle in the Victorian Crusade during World War I has been commemorated in his hometown for over 100 years.
Lieutenant Bernard Van Revere was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions on 29 September 1918 at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he had no idea that he was killed by a sniper four days later and was awarded the British Army's highest decoration.
His two grandchildren unveiled the memorial at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the monument was a "sacred symbol" that revealed exactly 100 years later his grandfather's career as an actor.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under intense fire from torpedoes and machine guns".
He later rushed to the gunboat, led the line as "the greatest warrior", and then, in a flash, charged into the field artillery, taking down three squadrons of snipers.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said of his grandfather's behavior, "I know I'll never be able to follow, but it's trivial".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set fire to the fireworks after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said, "It's an honor to be part of the parade", adding, "The courage of a true hero is proven by the support we're getting from so many people".
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 get Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this: you've been watching Bellator 206 all night, but you've been denied access to the main event.
The San Jose programme featured 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to face off, British viewers were stunned when the news was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some of them, especially after they were up early for the game, were not impressed.
One Twitter fan described the shift to children's comics as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said, "At 6 a.m., we had to switch to children's programming because the content was inappropriate, and that's the government's policy".
Peppa pig, you know.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would plan their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably solve it", Coker said.
"But it's Sunday morning at 6 a.m., and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday, their time, Monday, our time.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when that changed, a lot of the letters came and went, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical flaw.
But that wasn't it, it was the government's problem.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce it to five games instead of six games like we normally do, and we tried to provide too much for the fans, and we just passed.
It's a sad state of affairs".
Tom Daley felt inferior when it came to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
He said that he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he went to middle school.
Speaking about the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne gave him, he said he spoke boldly about gay rights, which could give others a glimmer of hope.
He also said that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the longtime regular host of the show, took a few months off due to illness.
In her first appearance as a cast member on Laverne, Daley said, "I felt like I was the most miserable person in the world because it wasn't socially acceptable to like men and women.
He said, "To this day, those feelings of feeling less and feeling different are the real things that gave me the strength and courage to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, something, and when he finally found out what he was, he said he didn't disappoint everyone.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT athlete and used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge more countries not to punish homosexuality.
He said he was lucky to be able to live without waves, and he said it because he wanted to give others a glimmer of hope.
Three-time World Cup winner Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker he met in 2013, said, "I felt amazing" when he fell in love with a guy.
Daily said she married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but the age difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through so much at such a young age", he said -- he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find a freezer who had gone through the same kind of high.
The couple became parents of a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black, and Daily said his "total perspective" had changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I would have said, 'You have to win the gold medal.'"
There's something bigger than the gold medal at the Summer Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2011.
Daily said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad can't be in the front row,'" he said.
He said, "I'm gonna hold his hand while he stops breathing, and it's only after he stops breathing that I admit he's not an immortal".
The next year, she competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had always dreamed of, diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, and there was nothing better", he said.
It also inspired his choice of his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which resonated with him in his fitness up to the Olympics and still resonates today.

Mickelson is in bad shape for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record for the 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson played his 12th game in the biennial tournament, and was benched by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's quarterback and possum.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often has been for America, the five-time major winner spent a day between being a cheerleader and working on the field to fix what was helping him.
The 48-year-old, who never had the most straightforward driver in his prime, is not ideal for a tight Le Golf National course where long runs punish wrong turns on a daily basis.
And if the course itself isn't overwhelming, Mickelson will face freshman Tommy Fleetwood in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari to win all four games this week.
If the Americans are four points behind in their 12th straight start, and they start well, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Fury couldn't say much else, but she expressed confidence in her man.
Furyck said, "He understood his role today, and he patted me on the back, and he looked at my arm and said, 'I'll be ready tomorrow.'"
"He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it worked out, and that's how we thought we should go.
He wants to be outdoors like everyone else.
Mickelson is set to beat Nick Faldo, who holds the record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never been as high as his personal best.
Mickelson is 18 wins, 20 losses and seven innings, but Furyk said his presence has brought a bit of a hole in the team.
"He's funny, funny, smart, likes to make fun of people, and he's a great guy in the team room", he explained.
I think it was fun to have the young players feed him a room again this week.
He offers more than just playing.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead going into the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward climb.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama Open, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but narrowly missed the finish line with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
You keep reminding us that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn that we lost and a big lead at Valderrama that we won, but only we won.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're going to be completely bored tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until you get the point across.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I'm always focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know so well what's on the other side, and that's the best players in the world.
Björn was pleased with how his players had played on the tough golf course, adding: "We will never be better than this".
Tomorrow is different.
Tomorrow is my upcoming solo show, which is a little different.
It's good to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you're out on your own, you're being tested to see if you're up to the task as a golfer.
That's the message we need to send to our athletes, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, leaving his partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself.
In contrast to Björn, opposing team Jim Furyk will find his players to do better individually as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth, who has three points from four, or Justin Thomas, who has three points from four.
Fury himself was at the turning point of the final day of the great turnaround when Europe was losing the Miracle of Medina after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain, got the players together on the last day of 1999, he said, "I remember every damn word".
There are 12 big games tomorrow, and you want to start as fast as you did in Medina, as you did in Brooklyn?
When that momentum flows in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield games.
We lined up and sent out the guys in a way that felt like we could do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the challenge of facing Rory McIlroy in the first round, and European players such as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter joined in the first round.
Björn said about singles, "I feel like I've got it all figured out, and I've followed this order".
The new German battleship is delayed again.
The German Navy's latest escort ship was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported that it would not arrive there until at least next year.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman, the approval of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Baden-Rheinland-Pfalz, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but trouble after a troubled delivery plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It's being reported that some of the stealth technologies will be installed, including powerful artillery, an array of air-to-air and anti-ship missiles, and radar attenuation, infrared, and sonic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, meaning that the latest frigates must be able to deploy at home ports for up to two years.
But the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art military vessels that Germany says will allow to invest power abroad will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit said.
The ill-fated F125 frigate was the subject of a scandal last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the background of the repatriation, but the German media have cited several critical software and hardware flaws that rendered the military a no-go zone once deployed.
The Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by about 120 crew members, only half the manpower of the old Bremen class, so the software flaw was particularly important.
It also turns out that the ship is dramatically overweight, which means it has low performance and limits the Navy's ability to make further upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne battleship Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as the similar class of battleship used by the German Navy during World War II.
In addition to the hardware failure, the pricing of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It's now up to $36 billion from the original $2.2 billion.
In light of recent warnings that the German Navy is shrinking, the issues of capturing the latest frigates are particularly important.
Earlier this year, the parliamentary defense secretary, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the navy was actually "running out of traps".
The official said that the problem is that the old ships are being dismantled, but no replacement ships are being supplied, and that the problem is only getting bigger over time.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust has been listening in on the secret life of bats.
A new study at a private reserve in the Scottish Highlands aims to shed light on how bats use this landscape to hunt for food.
We hope this discovery will shed new light on the unique behavior of these flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the brown long-eared bat and Daubento bat from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the common Soprano pipistrel and Soprano pipistrel.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile surveys using mobile detectors.
And the expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and what species are doing.
We'll create maps of their habitats and reports to create a detailed landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will help to determine which habitat is most important to bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as pasture, and the best way to maintain the forested areas of bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect their habitat and their habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be dangerous, because this can cause chemical processing of paper and building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technology to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
With 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land, NTS takes bats very seriously.
Ten trained specialists regularly conduct investigations and tests, and sometimes rescue operations.
The group is the first in Scotland to designate a bat reserve in the Thrive area of Dumfries and Galloway. Eight of the 10 bat species currently living in Scotland are in the reserve.
According to David Thompson, the site's administrator, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
And David also said, "There's a very good area for bats in the thrives".
"The old buildings are still there, the trees are still in the ground, and everything you need for bat life is there.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, and we're going to understand a lot of things that are necessary for bats to thrive while protecting them in this area and other areas".
David stressed that it is important to check the requirements before managing a bat habitat, because if one bat habitat is destroyed unintentionally, up to 400 females and young bats can die, and the resulting bat population in the area may be exterminated.
Currently, bats are protected and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their breeding grounds, is legally prohibited.
Elizabeth Ferrell, who works for the Scottish Bat Protection Agency, asked to be actively involved in the bat protection campaign.
"We still have a lot to learn about bats and how the different species that live in Scotland thrive", said Ferrell.
Ronaldo denies sexual assault charges and will file a lawsuit against the German magazine through his lawyer.
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied that the sexual assault allegations against him were "fake news" that were "manipulated by people involved using his name to get famous".
His lawyers plan to prosecute German news magazine Spiegel for reporting on his sexual assault allegations.
Ronaldo, a Portuguese and Juventus forward, was accused of sexually assaulting American Catherine Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to a report by Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo paid $375,000 for the woman's silence after she was forced to have sex with him.
Hours after the sexual assault allegations were reported, Honnold, 33, refuted the allegations of sexual assault in an Instagram live broadcast to 142 million followers, saying: "It's fake news.
"No. That's not true at all.
"The news today is completely fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, staring into the camera.
"They're using my name to get famous.
It's not a new thing.
I'm trying to be famous, and the press usually just pick up on things that are going to be a problem.
I'm very happy and everything is going smoothly".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer has filed a complaint against Schippel for reporting sexual assault allegations, calling it "unacceptable reporting that violates privacy".
According to Ronaldo's lawyer Christian Sertz, "This is one of the worst cases of violation of privacy in recent years, and Ronaldo is seeking a fair amount of damages in light of the moral damage and the seriousness of the violation of privacy".
The alleged sexual assault allegations occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Las Vegas Farms Hotel.
According to documents filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, Honanadu and Mayorga met at a nightclub and then went up to the hotel room where Honanadu was staying, where Honanadu attempted to force and suppress the intercourse.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after the sexual assault and said he was "99% good" and did it because of "the 1% bad part".
According to the documents submitted, Honanadu admitted to having sex with Mayorca but claimed it was consensual.
Mayorca went to the police station after the sexual assault and reported it and filmed the injured parts in the hospital, but said she agreed to negotiate later "for fear of reprisals" and "for fear of public humiliation".
Mayorga, now 34, said she wanted to cancel the deal because she was still traumatized by the sexual assault.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the sexual assault allegations, and he signed for powerful Italian side Juventus for €100 million this summer.
Brexit: Britain will 'let go and regret' the withdrawal of car manufacturers
The UK's industry minister, Greg Clark, said that the UK's post-Brexit industry, which has so far held a leading position in car manufacturing, would be "regrettable" if it was left behind.
A Toyota official also told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Barnaston, near Derby, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and Clark raised a "voice of goodwill".
"We need to find a compromise", Clark said.
A Japanese automaker says that a no-deal Brexit could lead to delays in crossing the border and job cuts.
The Barnaston plant, which makes the Toyota Oris and Avensis, exported 90 percent of the 150,000 cars it produced last year to EU member states.
"If I see the UK leaving at the end of March, we will have to stop production", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota at Barnaston.
Other British carmakers including Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and others have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will be conducted.
For example, BMW officials said they would close their mini-factory in Oxford next month, when Brexit comes into effect.
Looking at the announcements from carmakers, there is a growing concern that a no-deal Brexit could cause a huge disruption in the supply chain.
Toyota's production line is using the JIT method, which is to order the parts at the time of order, rather than stacking them together to make the vehicle, so the parts needed to produce the ordered car arrive from suppliers in the UK and EU member states every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves without a deal on March 29, there will be problems with parts crossing the border, leading to delays and shortages in parts supplies.
Production will be halted at Toyota's plant in Derbyshire, where it is impossible to store more than a day's worth of stock, a plant official said.
Secretary Clark noted that Prime Minister Theresa May, when planning post-Congress relations with the EU, "must be specific in not going through unnecessary verification procedures at the border".
"The negotiations are urgently needed, and we need the best possible negotiations to capture the opportunities that Brexit offers, not just the success that is right in front of us", said Secretary Clark on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Considering the concerns of not only Toyota but other car manufacturers, we should be able to guarantee that the supply chain that has been successful so far will continue to be successful in the future".
Toyota warns that it is difficult to predict how long production will be halted and that in the long run, additional costs will reduce production competitiveness and jobs.
Peter Sovalis, vice president of the union, who worked at Barnstone for 24 years, said that unions are very concerned, adding, "In my experience, jobs that have been lost once have never been restored.
The government spokesman stressed that "we will implement a precise and credible plan to establish good relations with the EU in the future".
According to a White House statement, President Trump will postpone his meeting with Secretary Rosenstein again.
A White House spokesman said on Sunday that a meeting with President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a sensitive issue, would be "postponed for another week" as hearings on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continue.
Deputy Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump's support for Russia and the president's possible interference with the implementation of post-election justice.
In the US political arena, there have been rumors for months that Trump's firing of the deputy attorney general will make it impossible for an independent investigation into Mueller's case.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Deputy Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a listening device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of firing Trump under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that the report was true.
On Monday, Rosenstein went to the White House amid reports of his resignation.
Instead of resigning, he announced that he would meet Trump on Thursday, while attending a UN conference in New York.
Trump stated that he "prefers not to prosecute" Rosenstein, and postponed the meeting to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where both Kavernov and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavernov of sexual harassment, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the Caberno sexual assault case for a week and postponed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders Trump spokeswoman appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Sanders said, "The date has not been set, and it could be this week, but it could be postponed to the next major considering all the issues that are currently going on at the Supreme Court.
But the White House will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated".
Some journalists may be skeptical because Sanders' spokesman has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Let's ask Chris Wheeler why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not because he hated the "attraction" of TV reporters, but because he was "not against the fact that it was an act of attraction".
He suggested that there would be more opportunities for President Trump and journalists to meet face-to-face.
He also said that "unlike previous presidents who had formal Q&A sessions, President Trump will be open about the issue", and without providing any specific evidence, he added, "We're looking at the numbers".
I'm about to have a press briefing, and I'm like, "Wouldn't it be so much better if the reporters had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a question for me?
The White House is trying to have more opportunities for dialogue, and we've actually had some conversations over the last few weeks, and now you can have a conversation with the president of the United States directly, even at press briefings".
President Trump has been questioned periodically when he leaves the White House, holds open sessions with current employees, or holds press conferences with senior officials.
He rarely gives a press conference alone.
In New York this week, President Trump may be able to explain why to a gathering of reporters at a press conference.
The Secretary of State for Health, NHS Scotland, is sending a letter to EU workers about Brexit fears!
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to the EU staff at NHS Scotland expressing his gratitude and hope they will continue to work after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has decided to cover the costs of applying for settlement status for EU citizens already working in the public service sector.
The letter said: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU, which have been in a state of stagnation for some time this summer, are continuing and the House will be able to decide on matters as planned.
But the UK government is also preparing for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.
I know you're feeling very insecure.
So I want to once again express my deepest gratitude for the hard work of all our workers, regardless of nationality.
The valuable experience and expertise of our colleagues from the EU and beyond has helped us to improve the quality of healthcare and provide more benefits to patients and communities.
Scotland is your unquestionable treasure and we look forward to your continued residence".
Christian Abercrombie, emergency surgery after a head injury!
Tennessee State Tiger linebacker Christian Abercrombie was admitted to the emergency room with a shoulder injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The head coach of the Tennessee State University Road Lead told reporters that he suffered a head injury just before the halftime break.
"Christian walked up to the line and fell down", Reed added.
Before the trainer and paramedics could get him on the sideline, Abercrombie was put on an oxygen mask and taken to the hospital for further testing.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris (WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "we have not heard any details about the type of injury or the severity of the injury yet", and that Tennessee State University is working to determine when the injury occurred.
In his first season as a sophomore athlete, Abercrombie transferred from Illinois to Tennessee State University.
He had five tackles before the game ended and had 18 tackles for the season.
The UK government, if a foreigner buys property, they'll have a higher tax on the property.
The newly revised Tory policy will require foreign investors to collect additional cognition tax on property purchases in the UK and use the funds for UK residents.
This decision will attract younger voters and make the weakened Corbyn quiver.
A cognition tax will be levied on people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is trying to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will be charged a higher property tax if they buy property in the UK and that the extra money they save will be used to help the homeless.
The move aims to curb the weakening of Jeremy Corbyn, who is backed by young voters, and attract high-income voters by promoting a more affordable housing package.
The additional tax collected by the UK government is for private investors and foreign institutional investors who do not pay taxes, and the funds collected will be used to solve the problem of homelessness.
Up to 3% of the current income tax is added, including higher tax rates for purchases of a house for a single-family, two-family or rental purpose two years ago.
The Treasury expects this measure to raise an additional £120 million a year.
Foreign investors who do not reside in the UK are buying up about 13% of London's New Town properties, causing house prices to rise, making it difficult for Westerners to find a single-family home.
As foreign investors spend most of their time abroad, not in Britain, many affluent areas, especially the capital, are becoming "ghost towns".
The policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson announced that he would drastically reduce the income tax on first time home buyers.
He blamed the rising property prices on big business buying up land without development and urged May to undo the sanctions on affordable housing to fix "the disrupted UK housing market".
Corbyn has been campaigning for landmark housing reforms, such as rent adjustments and the end of the rent-to-own-property housing bubble.
They also want to give the council more power over new housing construction.
In this regard, the Prime Minister said, "Last year, during my term as Prime Minister, I said that I would revive the British Dream of ensuring a better life for the younger generation.
And that means, soon, fixing the broken housing market.
The UK government is open to anyone who wants to live, work and invest in the UK.
But it's not right that private investors who don't live in the UK or foreign corporate investors can buy property easily and that hardworking British citizens have a hard time buying a home.
The dream of homeownership is becoming more distant and more people are asking for a place to sleep in a bad environment".
Jack Ross, the ultimate goal is Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "ultimate goal" would be to become Scotland manager at the right time.
The 42-year-old Scottish manager is delighted to have won promotion to the North-East, who are currently third in the First Division with three points.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound: "I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But I was a loser and I couldn't get any higher".
"I grew up watching Scotland's games with my father in Hampden, and there was always something that attracted me.
Running a club successfully is the only way to seize the opportunity".
Ross was previously managed by Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager said he could follow Ross without fear, who had successfully guided the club to relegation from Wansley and Dumbarton Town.
"My goal now is to get this club back into the Premier League.
"Given the structure and facilities of this club, it's right to be in the Premier League".
"It's not easy to get back to the Premier League, but I'm probably the only one who can say that I've brought the club back to the top".
Ross was assistant manager at Dumbarton and coached Hart's coaching staff for 15 months before taking over for three years.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren to the championship the following season.
Having spent his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Fockork, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy, Ross said he was more comfortable than ever.
And when I look back on the day I took over Alloa, I think that was a real turning point.
"I honestly believed that the manager position was more appropriate than playing the game.
It might have seemed strange that I would be leaving, when I was doing pretty well, living pretty decent lives, and having the honor that comes with it.
But it was too hard to play.
I had to do a lot of stuff every week.
I felt a lot of stress and pressure every time I went to a game, and I thought that management would be better for me.
I always wanted to be an executive, but I'm doing it now, and I feel most comfortable doing what I think is best for me as an adult".

Polls show that Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. are a good time to have a pint.
British pubs, which were weakened by the Moody's push for a new rider, rose, but franchise restaurants' sales declined.
According to statistics, Ferb and Bar's sales increased by 2.7% in July, but the restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who drew the figures, said: "As the weather continues to warm and the British team promotes itself against expectations at the World Cup, sales in July showed a similar pattern to June last year, but restaurant sales declined instead.
Restaurant sales dropped 1.8 percent in June, and then dropped even more in July.
The restaurant sales have fallen, compared to the best performance of the previous month for the mainstream pubs.
Even the foodie pubs don't have the classics on the menu, but not as much as the restaurant operators.
People want a light drink.
"Overall, mainstream sales in pubs and bars this month were up 6.6 percent, and food sales were down 3 percent".
Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Receiver Analyst, said that following the April situation, this trend is expected to continue.
Weather, important social events, or sporting events, are the biggest factors that affect the food industry's revenue.
It's clear that restaurants will continue to struggle, and the 4.8% drop in sales over the previous year is fueling cost problems.
The foodie's stack of food stores that were on the verge of collapse took a fatal hit, and if the temperatures drop in August, whether sales will increase as the academics have been saying, we'll see in time".
The total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7 percent in July, which is delaying the opening of new stores.
Copper Pitch Tracker, which monitors industry sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups (total sales of over £9 billion) to establish industry benchmarks.
One in five kids has a social media account that their parents don't know about.
The survey found that at least one in five children aged 11 to 15 has a secret social media account with their parents and teachers.

The news has fueled fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students have a young "Joyo" account that their parents are happy with and on the other hand have a private account.
A mother stumbled upon a video on a secret website of her 13-year-old daughter asking other teenagers to "rape" her.
A study by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, a UK-based organisation of digital awareness and independent schools, found that 40% of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two accounts, and half of these admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said, "The fact that so many teens are trying to have their own space online that parents and teachers can't find is just adding to the anxiety".
Eileen Doyle, representing the Athletes' Doctor at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eileen Doyle was elected as a non-executive director to run the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Council.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beatty sees this appointment as a great opportunity to fully exploit the vast experience Doyle has gained in international competition over the last decade.
"Eilidh is a highly respected figure in the athletics community in Scotland and the UK and around the world, and we believe that by joining the committee now, athletes will be able to benefit even more", added Beatty.
Doyle said, "I hope I can be a resource to deliver the players' medical care and help Scotland's sport to grow and help it a little bit".
An American who won two gold medals (two out of four total) in the 200m and 400m freestyle at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now works as a BBC expert was forced to retire after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted, "I had a stroke a month ago.
It was impossible to walk.
The doctor said that it would take time to see how well he recovered.
It was really hard, but I had to fully recover and learn to walk again, and today I'm going to do some agility training.
Thank you so much for sending me a message of encouragement".
The controversial online advertisement for breastfeeding, the comparison of a breastfeeding woman to a milkman?
An online controversy erupted when a breast-feeding machine manufacturer ran an ad comparing breast-feeding women to milk.
Elby, the breastfeeding device manufacturer, has released a somewhat tongue-in-cheek music video ad for the "world's first wearable silent breastfeeder" that expresses the freedom the new breastfeeder will bring to breastfeeding women.
Four women who recently gave birth to babies, and as they dance in a cowshed full of hay, the soundtrack starts to say, "Okay, I'm fertilizing myself, but I can't see the tail", and "Can't you see the baby's breasts?
The chorus continues, "Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, give the baby the milk, squeeze, squeeze the breast milk".
The advert was posted on Facebook and caused a huge stir online.
The video has been viewed more than 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, with mixed reactions to the video, many saying it is a disruption to the agricultural sector.
"It was a very bad decision to use milk to advertise this product.
Like humans, you have to give birth to a calf and then wean it, and the only difference is that you separate the calf within a few days of weaning.
The Elby breast pump can be attached directly to the inside of the underwear without being visible.
Another commented: "It is a fact that this ad is traumatizing to nursing mothers and babies.
But shouldn't we use milk to advertise a breast milk product for women who don't have to fall off with their baby?"
Another comment read: "No advertising!"
There are also comments advocating the advert for the breast milkers.
"I think it's a genius idea.
If I'm still breastfeeding, this is something I want.
I felt like a complete cow every time I was weaned.
I accepted that this ad was a little strange, but it was a reflection of reality.
It's a product of genius".
Another commented, "I think this is a fun ad for a breastfeeding woman who thought of herself as a cow while breastfeeding at work or in the bathroom".
It's not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry".
The back of the ad says that the women were wearing a bra and dancing with their breast pumps on.
The ad was based on the fact that many women who breastfeed are thought of as cows during breastfeeding.
The Elby breast pump is noisy, has no wires or tubes, and can be mounted in a water bra without being visible, allowing it to move freely, hold the baby, and even exit during breastfeeding.
Anna Vallarin, partner and ECD at Mather, said, "The Elby is a groundbreaking product that should be launched around the world.
It shows both the nursing mother and the milk, illuminating all the issues related to breastfeeding and showing in an interesting way how much freedom the new attachment device guarantees.
This is not the first time that Elvy's breeding has made headlines.
During Launder Fashion Week, two breastfeeding women wore designer Marta Jakubowski clothes and walked the walkway with a breast pump attached.
Hundreds of illegal immigrant children are being quietly held in a detention center on the Texas border.
While the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border each month has not changed significantly, the number of detained illegal immigrant children has skyrocketed, in part because the Trump administration has enacted a ruthless crackdown that has made it harder to connect children to sponsors.
Generally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants and are afraid to take action because they are more likely to be deported from the United States if they offer to take their children.
The risk of deportation has increased since the US Department of Justice in June announced that all adults involved in potential sponsorship must submit fingerprints and share fingerprint data with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Alvens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that he had arrested dozens of applicants who claimed to support children without parents.
The prosecution later announced that 70% of the applicants arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the parents or related family members are in the United States illegally, and a significant number are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to track down these illegal criminals", Alvens added.
According to the protection agency's staff, in order to process the children more quickly, the administration has introduced a new law that allows children to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of waiting 60 days as usual.
In many cases, instead of going to court, they use video calls to answer questions about their legal status to an immigration judge.
If they are deemed not to be eligible for assistance, they are immediately deported.
Shelter staff and the system have reported in recent months that the longer the detention period, the more anxiety and depression children experience, causing them to suddenly become violent or attempt to escape.
Supporters said they were more concerned that large facilities like Tornillo were more likely to ignore the emotional symptoms children were experiencing at scale.
When children are unprepared psychologically, or they can't greet their friends properly, and suddenly they're isolated in a shelter, they're going to be more traumatized than they were before.
The US, France, Turkey demanded the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the eight-year war.
Muallem, who is acting as deputy prime minister, said that the foreign occupation forces are illegally staying in Syrian territory under the pretext of a major offensive.
"Foreign occupying forces must withdraw immediately without any conditions", the UN General Assembly said.
Muallem claims that "the war on terror is over" in Syria, saying that more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions more have been displaced since 2011.
The government of Damascus also added that it will continue this "holy battle" until "the terrorist groups and all illegal foreign occupation forces currently stationed in all Syrian territory are completely eradicated".
The United States has sent about 2,000 troops to Syria to train and advise Kurds and Syrian Arabs, mostly those opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed 1,000 ground troops to war-torn Syria.
The situation on the refugee issue has now improved enough to allow for a return, and has created an irrational fear in "some Western countries" that refugees are unable to return home.
"We have asked the international community and human rights organizations to help the refugees return home".
"So we are politically questioning what should be treated as a purely human rights issue", said Muallem.
The US and EU have warned that they will not support reconstruction until Assad and the opposition agree politically to end the war.
The UN representative said that Russia and Turkey recently agreed to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, creating an opportunity to advance political talks.
Thanks to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, the area of 3 million people was spared from attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has a clear deadline and hoped that military operations would quickly wipe out the jihadist terrorists of the Nusra Front, who are linked to al-Qaeda.
UN Ambassador Stéphane de Mistura is hoping that a new committee made up of the government and the opposition will draft a post-war constitution and prepare for elections in Syria.
Muallem warned that the government's members should be limited to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution and not interfere, and that the Syrian government should be allowed to participate in the committee.
Why Trump is going to win reelection
Under that logic, Trump is likely to succeed in the 2020 re-election, assuming he does not step down as an impeachment or speaker before the end of his term, as many liberals would like.
It is also certain to be the most dramatic culmination of the president's tenure.
We can't pick up the signal from the viewer's feed at the moment.
Since 2014, CNN's golden hour ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million golden-hour viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Daily Mail Media Show drew 3.5 million viewers during prime time, the highest viewership among cable channels.
Neil Baer, the general director of the ABC drama The Shining, said that the Shining is just a guide for people because they can't understand it. The Shining is the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the US Congress is destroyed by a raid.
Comedy writer and writer of the harsh truth-telling stories of married couples who only collect the slick parts and sneak into Hollywood boy clubs, Nell Scovel, offers a different theory.
Scobel recalled a taxi he took in Boston just before the 2016 election.
The reporter told her that he was going to photograph Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Scovel told me that the reporter said "Scoop" because Trump makes me laugh.
There is entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything on television, the storyline that unfolds in Washington can determine the future of Lowe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant family reunification, and the state of the world economy.
It's a privilege only for privileged viewers to switch channels.
Yet, watching an expert panel discuss the use of deep background cheaters by Bob Woodward, quoting his book The Cotton Bowl, a $15,000 jet jacket made of tanned leather by Paul Manniport (which The Washington Post called a garb full of conceit), and Stormy Daniel's suggestion of Trump's, well, wild description of the body, feels like going beyond the bounds of the average citizen.
I myself will never look at Super Mario from the same perspective again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show, said Trump's behavior on the show is similar to reality shows because he feeds viewers every day.
You can't miss an episode because you're behind.
When I visited Mr. Flaice this week, it was a bright 80 degree Fahrenheit day on the northern beach of Kaua'i, and he was locked in his room watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't even close his eyes to the moment when Brett Cabernet was going up against the Senate and the Supreme Court was going to be decided.
Mr. Flies remembers the old days when we put on a crazy show and people would say, "We're going to see the end of Western civilization".
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true.

Foreign funds, the highest marginal vote in the midterm elections, are pouring in.
It's no surprise that funding is flowing into Pennsylvania's 17th District, because congressional redistricting means two incumbents are fighting for a seat.
The recent redistricting has put House Speaker Connor Lam on the ballot, who won a special election in another district last spring.
Ram is pitted against incumbent Republican Keith Rossfuss, who represented Pennsylvania's 12th District. The 12th District overlaps heavily with the 17th District.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January, the newly drawn map was constitutionally garimandering to Republican tastes.
The campaign for the new 17th District sparked a financial tug-of-war between the Democratic National Campaign Council (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC), the major political parties' financial bulwarks.
Ram rose to prominence in March when he narrowly won the Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District special election.
The seat had been held by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts, Democrats, are going to be a little bit more dominant.
The United States supports China, and it's trying to sanction El Salvador.
Diplomats witnessed the fact that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized China without the US's objection.
Trump held a heated meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Barella in June 2017, and kept a hotel in Panama until his associates kicked out the Trump corporation's management team.
State Department officials have decided to reinstate the top U.S. diplomatic missions in the Dominican Republic, Panama and El Salvador, following a recent decision not to recognize the island, as State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only directed at El Salvador, which received about $140 million in 2017 from the United States in the form of drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions included the removal of financial aid and restrictions on visas, which would have been a painful experience for El Salvador, which suffers from high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continue, officials in North and Central America have decided to postpone a high-level meeting focused on security and economics similar to last year's meeting, which appeared to be a step forward in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made clear they wanted the conference to continue, effectively blocking the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was recommended to speak at the meeting, which is scheduled for mid-October, diplomats said, showing the importance the government attaches to the meeting.
And three US ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any ruthless transfers or punitive provisions from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the discussions, which were described by three US ambassadors, two of whom agreed to discuss internal decisions on the condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were confirmed by an outside expert who is closely connected to the administration and who also agreed to speak out on the condition of anonymity.
The history of research
The possibility of Trump's judicial interference, presented by special counsel Robert Mueller, may be unavoidable.
According to the report, Mueller has launched an investigation to find out if Russia colluded with the Trump campaign to interfere with our election.
If the Congress changes ownership, Trump could be accused of being at the heart of the case, just before he stands before the voters for re-election, and could become a member of a jury of his peers.
This is a fantasy full of "ifs", and the fact that Trump's fall is unconditional doesn't mean that he will, of course, be the same in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have the choice to decide the continuation of this situation.
In 1938, German officers prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, which would have been successful if the West had continued to resist Hitler and support Czechoslovakia.
But we failed, and we missed our chance to stop the massacre.
The flow of history turns at these inflection points, and in them the progress of a smooth democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are at a tipping point in history.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who could have been the lead investigator on Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since last year when the newspaper reported that he had secretly recorded the president's speech and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein said the Times's account was inaccurate.
How would we respond if the FBI investigation into Humbert Cabrino was inadequate or not lawful, or if we were acquitted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of dishonest testimony and sexual assault?
And above all else, will you vote for Trump in the midterm elections to hold him accountable to Congress?
If we fail to meet these challenges, democracy will fall into a bitter winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, where I was once an ambassador, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied Czechoslovakia.
My mother survived, and 60 years after immigrating to the United States, she sent me to a table with a Nazi-style light on.
How can I, with this legacy, not be optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is president of the Washington Coalition for Responsible and Ethical Citizens and author of The Last Palace: A Conversation of a Turbulent Century in Europe in One Family and Five Lives.
Rangers quarterback Graham Dorrance is optimistic ahead of his game against Rapid Vinnie.
Rangers face home side Lapith Bean on Thursday. Rangers know that a win over Austria in the Europa League Group G stage will provide them with a solid base to progress to the knockout stages of the competition, following their impressive draw against Spain's Virreal earlier this month.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance was sidelined with a knee injury until his debut in a 2-2 draw with Villareal, but he believes Rangers can achieve greater success based on these results.
"We had a good score situation because Gambia are a good team", said 31-year-old Dolan.
We went into the stadium believing we could do something, and we could score.
I don't know if we could have scored more at the end, but overall, the draw was a fair result.
I think Viral probably did better in the first half, and we did better in the second half.
On Thursday, the big game of the Europa League will be held again.
We hope to get three points, but it will not be easy for Villareal because they did well in the last game, but if we work with the fans on the pitch, we can make a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough because of personal injuries and club changes, but now the club is pretty satisfied.
The team is in good shape, all the players are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
I hope I can move on and forget about last season and succeed.
Women, I can't sleep worrying about retirement funds.
Even though the respondents had a clear idea of what care services they wanted, very few people shared their thoughts with their families.
In this nationwide survey, half of the participants said they talk to their spouse about long-term care services.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children.
Holly Snyder, president of the National Life Insurance Company, says that the people of the Gambia want their families to take care of them, but they do not try to come forward and talk.
This is how you start a conversation.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don't give enough time to tell your family what you want, you don't have time to prepare for care.
Discuss with your doctor or family where and how you will receive care, as these options are important factors in determining the cost of care.
Bring financial counseling: If you have counseling, it can help you to set up care expenses.
The funding for long-term care service options can be provided through a long-term care insurance policy, a cash value mixed life insurance policy, or if the money is sufficient, the expense can be met with private capital.
Make sure you handle the legal paperwork: Avoid legal disputes.
Have a health insurance agent, a trusted person, monitor your health care, and a professional follow your lead in case communication is impossible.
Also, consider hiring a power of attorney for financial management.
Choose someone you trust to make financial decisions and to keep you from being pushed into a down payment when normal life becomes impossible.
Remember the little details: Imagine that an elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.

Ilfracom man, multiple air gun shots to the head.
A man returning home after a night out was shot multiple times by an air gun.
The victim, in his 40s, was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at 2:30 a.m. local time, as a premeditated act of terrorism.
The victim didn't see the killer.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications cut off, rescue officials were unable to obtain any information about the eastern Galla area north of Palo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people in Fallu were evacuated shortly after the disaster struck.
Some important facts about the Palu and Tonggala region of Sulawesi are:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island. The population of Palu is approximately 379,800 as of 2017.
Palo was hit by an earthquake and tsunami while celebrating the city's 40th anniversary.
Tunggala is a temperate zone that extends 300 km (180 mi) along the coast of the northwestern region of Sulawesi.
The prefecture is one level below the province. The population of Tonggala was about 299,200 as of 2017.
Agriculture and fishing are the main industries in the central Sulawesi province, especially in the Eastern Galla region.
Nickel mining is also of high importance within the province, but is concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to Indonesia's disaster relief agency, Palu and Tonggala have been hit by tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami hit the city of Tanggala, killing over 200 people and destroying hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck in the western region of the Tungala and killed nine people.
Indonesia is geologically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
The major recent earthquakes and tsunamis are:
2004: On December 26, a threatening earthquake off the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A strong earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits the most populous island in Indonesia, Java, and causes a tsunami that sweeps along the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the capital of West Sumatra province, Pacang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hits the Fidi Jaya Regency in Aceh province, triggering riots in the region, reminiscent of the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the collapsing building.
2018: A threatening earthquake hits Indonesia's tourist destination of Lombok Island, killing more than 500 people. Most of the damage occurred in the north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son, arrested for domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska Governor and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Track Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Track Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
Police reports say that Palin took her phone when a female acquaintance tried to report the allegations to the police.
Palin is currently being held at the Matanuska-Sustina Pre-Psychiatric Facility and is held in a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He also appeared in court on Saturday and stated that he was "absolutely innocent" in his defense.
Palin faces up to three misdemeanor counts, up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a possible one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Pelline has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was indicted for assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently pending before the Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated during a domestic violence incident.
Pelline's girlfriend claimed he had a price on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was accused by veterans groups of blaming her son's violent behavior on post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his experience in Iraq.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
On Friday, at least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and telecommunications systems are paralyzed and the death toll is expected to rise within days.
The quake struck just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video of the shock moment is circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the beach, hundreds of people gathered in Palo to enjoy the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors, unusual attempted capital murder for a suspect in a New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Seipullo Siphoff, a suspect in the New York City terror attacks that killed eight people, the rarest case of federal crimes in New York state since 1953.
According to the charges, Siphoff, 30, used a home depot rental truck to hit a pedestrian and a cyclist who were driving on a bike path on the Lower Manhattan Westside Highway.
According to a consent decree filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Psychophobia intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted fatal injuries.
According to court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the incident, a federal grand jury indicted Siphoff on 22 counts, including eight counts of involuntary manslaughter, one count of violent breaking and entering, and one count of car destruction, all of which federal prosecutors often charge in planned crimes.
The prosecution said the raid required a thorough planning and a thorough investigation, describing Siphoff's criminal methods as "depraved, brutal and depraved".
In the will, the injured, injured, and deceased were given to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Kleveth, Anne-Laure Decadut, Darren Drake, Ariel Alrige, Hernan Perucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damián Peguncu's family and friends.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York imposed the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Vance was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal case to carry out an execution in New York State was that of Julius and Eszell Rosenberg in 1953. The couple, married, had been convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown no remorse for the long time since the incident.
Police noted that Siphoff told investigators that he felt better about what he had done.
According to the prosecutor, Saifov told authorities that he had seen ISIS videos on his phone and had the idea to commit the crime.
According to police, Saifov also asked for ISIS flags to be hung in the hospital.
He denied the charges against him on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the lawyers representing Psychop, said the defense team was obviously disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
He added that he believes that trying to frame a death sentence rather than accepting a life sentence without the possibility of parole and making him admit to the charges only worsens the wounds of all involved.
Sipov's defense team asked the former prosecutor not to commute the death sentence.
Tell the Conservative MP that Old Parage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
The ageing Farage vowed to activate the army in the DRC during a protest at the Conservative Party meeting place today.
Farage, a former leader of the UK Independence Party, said politicians should feel the heat of opposition to the EU, with one member of Theresa May's cabinet saying he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bourne told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit minister, Britain would have left in a fit of rage.
But it appears that Prime Minister May is having difficulty integrating a severely divided cabinet, with the EU's Conservative Party remaining in the anti-Brexit protests.
Prime Minister May is working to get the deal with the EU back on track amid ongoing attacks from pro-Brexit, opposition and the EU.
May's allies advised that she should continue to push for negotiations with EU headquarters in Brussels despite opposition, and that Labour and the EU opposition should choose between her negotiating proposal and the "Hand-off".
The MP said at a meeting in Solihull that leaving would mean leaving and that he wanted to scrap the deal with the EU.
He said he should have made Farage a colleague and given him authority to negotiate with the EU headquarters in Brussels.
He said that if Champalayaj was the chief executive, we would have already withdrawn.
Bowen, a member of the Wellingborough Assembly, also added: "She will fight for Brexit but first she must drop her deal with the EU".
He was opposed to the European Union and he did not fight the World War to surrender.
I want to make our own laws in our country.
The MP denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, saying it was completely wrong that the people of the Federation of Hong Kong had changed their opinion to the EU remainder.
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative MEP, also took part in the protest, telling reporters: "Let me be blunt: Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Prime Minister's deal has lost popularity among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, and the deal is not popular with those inside the Conservative Party and activists who took to the streets to elect us in the first place.
Please, cancel the deal and listen to the people.
In addition, through remarks to Prime Minister May, she added that the Prime Minister can only keep his promises if he keeps them.
At the rally, Farage said he would feel a fever if politicians betrayed the 2016 referendum.
He added that the issue is between us and our people and our political class.
They're betraying Brexit, and we're here to tell the people that they can't just betray and run away.
In a statement to his enthusiastic supporters, he wants you to give a hot taste to our political establishment as we stand on the brink of betraying Brexit.
We will mobilize the people's forces that brought Brexit to this country and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Commonwealth.
Meanwhile, the EU's remaining members marched in Birmingham city centre ahead of a two-hour rally.
After the Remain march began, some activists waved their arms at the Conservative Brexit front.
Adonis, a senior Labour Party official, opened the rally and insulted the Conservatives who were struggling with security issues in their party app.
The Cheyenne are the people who said that all the information technology systems and all the other technology in Canada could be in Canada, that a frictionless border, a borderless free trade with Ireland, etc. would be possible, he said.
It's a load of crap.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren, I'm not going to run for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, shared his plans Saturday at a town council in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of Trump, is running for re-election against Republican state representative Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016.
Warren is currently being considered as Trump's opponent in the 2020 election.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th town hall in Warren, using the town council method adopted after Trump's election.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run.
Warren responded that it was time for a woman to go to Washington and get to the top and fix a broken government.
Suspect in the shooting that killed Sims of Louisiana State University, arrested.
Louisiana Baton Rouge police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police said they arrested 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at 11 a.m.
ET News released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday morning in the Southern University campus.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said that Sims suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head, which resulted in his death, according to 247 Sports.
Wade was trying to protect his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson was at the scene during the interrogation, and he confessed to possessing a weapon and firing at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims is a 6-foot-6 basketball player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games last season, making 10 starts, and averaged 5.6 points, 2.9 rebounds and 17.4 minutes per game.
Louis Hamilton, team leader, defeats Sebastian Petel for the world championship.
Ever since Valtteri Bottas took over from Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has been clear that Mercedes' team order will play a significant role in the race.
From the start line, Bottas started off feeling good, maintaining the lead for the first two laps, and almost dropping him to call Petel and attack his teammate Hamilton.
Petel got to the stop first and let him continue running at the end of the line, but he had to be more careful.
Hamilton entered the parking area after one lap, but after a fierce confrontation between the two vehicles, the Ferrari driver was unable to get out of the interior, being at risk of resistance after a double action at the third transformer, and he was able to hit ahead.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the stadium on his 21st birthday and finished seventh in the first lap.
After that, he held on to his tires for most of the race and was able to see a quick finish line pass, but also beat Kimi Raikkonen and finished fourth.
He finally came to a stop on lap 44, but could not accelerate for the remaining eight laps and Raytheon regained fourth place.
Dumbledore excelled all weekend and it was a very gentlemanly day, which allowed me to pass.
"Our team finished first and second, and we did very well", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump publicly mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, claiming she had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Cabernet of sexual assault.
Trump did not directly comment on Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee at a rally in West Virginia, accusing the current events in the Senate of "being a good indication of the vicious, bad, and untruthful people who are behind it".
"The beautiful thing about what's been happening in the Senate over the last few days is that when you look at the anger, you see people who are angry and mean and mean and not truthful", he said.
I saw the leaked material, and I said, "Oh, I didn't do it".
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Did you leak the information to Congresswoman Diane Feinstein?
Remember her answer -- did you leak the documents?
Oh, no, not really.
I didn't leak.
Well, wait a minute.
"We leaked"... "No, we didn't leak", he added, impersonating the senator.
Congressman Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges against the Caberno nominee, which Ford filed in July, and it was leaked in early September, but he denied that the letter was leaked from his office.
The Hill newspaper reported that Senator Feinstein argued in the Senate that "Dr. Ford did not hide her claims.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, as she asked.
But Trump did not approve of Senator Feinstein's claims, saying at a rally on Saturday: "To be honest, it was really bad body language".
She might not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee who is facing sexual misconduct charges from three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
They're trying to regain power at any cost.
They don't care who they have to hurt and who they have to topple to take power", Trump said, according to Mediatech.
Dundee Stars win 5-3 against the Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against the Dundee Stars.
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves after a 5-3 win in the second leg against the Belfast Giants in Dundee on Saturday and a defeat in the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants on Friday.
The Giants led by two goals in the first half with strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie added goals for the home team Dundee Stars before Dwyer regained the lead.
François Bouchard added a point before Lucas Rundwald Nielsen's two goals sealed the win, giving Dundee a point to tie the Giants.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
Dundee and the Giants won their last three games in their fourth game of the season.
Dwyer scored the first goal with the help of Kendall McFaul in the 35th minute of the first half, and four minutes later, with an assist from David Rutherford, Bovillier opened the scoring with a double.
Sullivan helped the home side to take the lead at 13:10 of the first half and at 15:16 with Matt Marquart, Connie scored the equaliser.
Dwyer scored the second goal of the night, and the Giants held the lead until the first half.
The home side finished ahead and Bouchard once again tied the game with a power play goal at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Coran helped late Neilson to give Dundee their first ever lead, and he led the team to victory in the mid-season finale.
The Giants have won four of their last five games and will play Milton Keynes on Friday.
Hundreds of passengers are trying to escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has died trying to help a plane carrying hundreds of people land safely on the ground.
A massive earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, followed by a tsunami, killing more than 800 people and leaving many missing.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palo.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Agung refused to take off from the control tower at the fallu airport at the shaky Mutiyalah Siss al-Jupri airport.
He was on the runway to ensure the safe takeoff of the Battic Air 6321.
He then jumped from the control tower thinking the traffic control tower was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Australian broadcaster ABC reported that Johannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority, said his decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balipaban in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Fallu this morning.
It seems to tear the heart out of me to hear about this", he added.
Meanwhile, Indonesia's disaster response agency says access to Tunggal, Sepi, and Bungo is restricted. Authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands.
A spokesman for the Disaster Relief Agency in Sutopo, Puruu Nugroho, said: "The death toll still appears to be increasing, many bodies are still under the rubble and it is difficult to recover the bodies".
The city of Palu was flooded by waves of up to 6 meters.
Military and commercial aircraft are importing aid and supplies.
The mother, Kusuma Lisa, 35, said in an interview with Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Small trees are being looted everywhere".
"The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there", said Jan Gelband, the head of the Indonesian International Red Cross (IRC) in an interview with CNN.
This is already tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesia's Joko Widodo, who arrived in Palu on the 23rd, issued the following instructions to the military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crashes Now Air New Guinea says a man is missing after the plane crashed in the marsh.
The airline said one person was missing after the plane crashed into a Pacific coral reef in Micronesia and all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane.
Air New Guinea said in a press release on Saturday afternoon that it could not currently find a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details such as the passenger's age or nationality.
The plane sank while attempting to land at the airport in Fuchs Island, and local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew.
Officials said seven passengers were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
Both the Air Force and the Navy said the plane landed on the marble before it reached the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jeans said the plane landed very low.
"It was a real good thing", said Mrs. Jeans.
Ms. Giance said she and others managed to walk to the emergency room of the sinking plane in waist-deep water.
The crew was shouting in shock, and he said he had a slight head injury.
The US Navy said that before the plane sank in about 100 feet of water, the crew working on the dock improvements helped with the rescue operation using inflatable boats that could carry people to shore.
According to the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines in the past 20 years, but not one has been related to Air New Guinea.
The analyst described the time when a woman was burned alive one night.
Prosecutors took a break Saturday from a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert in intelligence analysis at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours.
Rowlett used cell phone records to explain to the jury how she had identified the stench of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles the night of the death of 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
According to Clarion Leisure, Rowlett received location information from multiple cell phones, and said that the fact that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of the incident contradicted his earlier claims.
Analysis of cell phone data revealed that during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, he was actually with Chambers, and the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth about his statement that night that he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said, "He's making up stories about my truck being in Nashville".
Another contradiction is that Tellez said she knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
According to the cell phone records, they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers died, Tellez deleted his text messages, phone calls, contacts, and so on from his phone.
Wang had erased her from his life, said Wang and Hale.
The defendant will begin his final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be referred to a jury later that day.
What is hip-hop with a high racial consciousness?
Some hip-hop trios want to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
Bristol-based High Breed argues that hip-hop has moved away from its original focus on political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fuji and Kamen have recently been revived in the UK through artists like Akalana Rookie.
Another black man?!
New York resident nanny sues a couple for dismissal for racially charged text.
A nanny in New York is accusing the couple of being fired for racial profiling after receiving a misrepresented text from her mother complaining that she was "another black".
The couple said they were not racist and likened the lawsuit to "exploitation".
Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed embarrassment at the fact that her nanny, Giselle Morris, was black and first went to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband, saying, "No more OOOOOOOOOO black people".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mr. Morris.
The New York Post (NYP) reported that "uncomfortable" Placebo-Flexman fired Morris after realizing his mistake, saying that an active black nurse had not done her job properly and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Morris was sent home by Uber for a day's pay.
Currently, Morris is seeking compensation from the couple in connection with the dismissal. Although there was no formal contract, he is seeking compensation for six months of childcare work, paying $350 a day for the purpose for which he was first hired.
She added in an interview with the Post on Friday: "I want to show them that they shouldn't be doing this, and they know that it's discrimination".
The couple refuted the claim that they were racist, saying that it was justified to fire Morris because they feared that he would lose her trust after offending her.
"I sent her a text message that I didn't mean to.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, her husband Joel Plasco told the Post in an interview.
"But would you accidentally leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to?
The newborn?
Please.
Ms. Plasko compared the case to a "sandwich", saying that her wife had only been pregnant for two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you hire someone like that?
It's not a good thing", added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court quickly accused the couple on social media and rebuked their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers were concerned that readers would not empathize with the bear they were talking about, a new letter said.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine the position of someone who reads it for the first time before the book is published.
It's just very interesting for those of us who know about Paddington's tremendous success.
Her father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was inspired to write a children's book by seeing a small toy bear. She said that her father was optimistic about her work and could not have predicted it would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which came after her father's death last year, was "bitter yet sweet".
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family", and said that her father was proud of the ultimate success of the work, but did not brag much.
Wang was a rather quiet man, and he was not a man who liked to quarrel, she said.
"But Paddington felt so real to him, like having a child who accomplished something, something you didn't really do, but you're proud of them for.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always turned the ball over to Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but failed.
"Nard regularly called and said things were very bad, that she would have a hard time living", said Edna Rapperhouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad, and Nad said she was going to die in two minutes.
And I said,
"I love you so much, Chantasy".
I'll be right behind you.
I'm gonna be with you.
The drugs that doctors injected her with to keep her heart beating were slowly dissipating and leaving her system.
She had just died, and it was all about to end.
I knew all this was going on, but I just had to sit and wait.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I had to be really patient to get myself back".
Eventually, Mrs. Edna Rapperhouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside other passengers, unaware of her ordeal.
No one knew, she said.
"I was bowing my head, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I was in the air, and I felt an irresistible compassion for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women in a state of depression put up cards to stop suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries have put up cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on a bridge in Wales to help people ask for help.
Davis' son Tyler began suffering from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I wish no parent would feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, of Sydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew his son's smile.
They said his smile brightened up some rooms".
But he was in a really dark place, so he quit before he died".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother first discovered his brother had taken his own life.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm still worried about the domino effect".
Mr. Davis made a card, and he said, "Let people know that there are people you can go and meet and talk to, even if it's your friend.
Don't just sit there. You need a conversation".
Mr. Humphries, who had been friends with Mr. Davis for years, lost his partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
Wang didn't say she was feeling bad or depressed, she said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was in a deeply depressed state. He didn't face the children when they opened their presents on Christmas Day.
She said his death was a huge emotional blow to them, but they had to get over it, it tore a hole in their families' hearts.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we all have to keep moving forward and fighting".

As the FBI investigates, Brett Cabrino's future is in doubt.
If what he asked for, such as time limits, a limited scope of investigation, were actually done, it could bring some resolution, Plek said on Saturday, fearing the committee would "fall apart" amid a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Cabrino and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're all holding back because of timing.
With only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections, if the Republicans don't campaign as expected, it will have a serious detrimental effect on their attempt to elect him to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush had been calling Senators to support the governor. Cabner worked in the White House for President Bush, and through President Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI writes the report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It is not yet clear if Cabrino will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, and if he does, then Vice President Mike Pence will cast one vote to confirm his nomination as a Supreme Court justice.
The number of defectors under Kim Jong-un's regime is declining.
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of defectors entering South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
The MP cited data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, saying that there were 1,127 defectors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the impression of the amount demanded by the companies that help North Koreans defect and strengthen border controls between North Korea and China was a major factor.
North Korea has not made any public comments on this.
Most North Korean defectors eventually become Korean citizens.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them defect through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China often considers defectors to be illegal detainees rather than refugees and forcibly returns them.
Technically speaking, relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled denuclearization talks.
The meeting came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when Trump and Kim agreed to work together on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Li Yong-ho denounced the US sanctions as having made no progress since then.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Yugho said that if we do not have confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security and in such a situation there is no way we can unilaterally disarm first.
Nancy Pelosi called Caberno "neurological" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Caberno "neurologically unfit" to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview with the Texas Triangle Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday and said of Cabrino's testimony, "If a woman acted like that, they couldn't have thought they wouldn't say 'neurotic.'
Caberno emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Ford, both teenagers, and that she was Christine Blasey Ford.
At the opening, Cabrino was very emotional about his family and his high school years, sometimes almost screaming and even choking.
He also blatantly denounced the Democratic members of the committee around him, calling their claims a "reckless and organized assassination of character" by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton's 2016 election defeat.
Pelosi said she believed Cabrino's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
She said she believes he has offended himself with such statements and his way of blaming Clinton and the Democrats.
Pelosi has raised the question of whether she would attempt impeachment if Cabrino is confirmed, if the Democrats win a majority in the House.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court, he's ineligible to serve on the court he's currently serving on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi, a Democrat, added that she was concerned that Cabrino would make a hostile ruling on the former president's affordable care law or the Lowe's decision, as Cabrino was seen as conservative.
Cabrino avoided questions about whether he would overturn the Supreme Court's ruling at his appeal hearing.
Now is not the time for a nervous, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not cool.'
And women have to overcome it.
It's a righteous criticism of months of continued anger, and she can't say it without crying.
When we were angry, we were angry, and 45 years later, Mr. Stitch told me,
I guess this kind of thing is not uncommon, is it?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was in a coma somewhere, and she said she cried when she was angry, but she developed this technique: When she gets angry and starts crying, she might think that the person she's talking to is sad because she's crying.
I'm going to be a little bit of a jerk.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are fundamentally misunderstood, so tears are allowed to be part of the outlet of anger.
One of my clearest memories of my early working life was in a male-centered office, where I was in tears of unspeakable anger when an elderly woman grabbed my collar and led me up the stairs, a cold-hearted manager I had always been a little afraid of.
She told me that she never wanted anyone to see her cry.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and they'll sue you because they think they've been harassing you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic member of the Colorado House of Representatives, worked with Gary Hart to run for president.
In 1987, Ms. Hart was involved in a cheating incident on the ship Monkey Business, which led to her resignation. Congresswoman Schroeder was deeply frustrated when she felt there was no reason she should not consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a decision made after careful thought", she said, smiling after 30 years.
"Now there were seven more candidates in the race, and the thing they didn't need most was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
She was pushed out of the fundraising campaign because she started her campaign late, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She realized that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to male contestants would only give her $250.
Would they think I could get a smaller amount?
When she announced that she would not campaign, she was overwhelmed with gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it too difficult to raise funds, frustration at the system that was more difficult to target voters than representatives, and anger at sexism.
"You must have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", said Schroeder, recalling how the media reacted to her actions.
"I would have thought Clinix was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone.
She was crying.
How the trade war will help Beijing.
The start of the trade war between the US and China seemed to be a startling blow, and the battle is far from over, but experts say the rift between the two countries could be beneficial to China in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, including imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important quarterly news this week was the imposition of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which would tax half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
China has retaliated in the same way every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate, and the world's second-largest economy is not likely to be surprised anytime soon.
To bend Washington means to accept American demands, but to bow to the US publicly would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if China can make good use of the options it has, the U.S. trade war pressure could reduce the interdependence of the two economies and work in China's favor in the long run.
The fact that quick political decisions in either Washington or Beijing can create a scenario that could trigger an economic crisis in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers previously recognized, said Abigail Grace, Asia researcher at the New American Security Center, a think tank.
The Secretary of State says Syria, the return of refugees, all preparations are complete.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem told the UN General Assembly that the situation in Syria was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure with the progress in the war on terror", he said.
The government continues to evacuate residents to restore normalcy to areas devastated by terrorists.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are now in place, who have been forced to leave Syria due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled abroad since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from the countries that sponsored the coup.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team defeated the United States 16.5 to 10.5 in the 2018 Ryder Cup final at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States is currently the sixth-losing team in the Ryder Cup, which is held in Europe, and has not won in Europe since 1993.
Denmark captain Thomas Beecham's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States, and Europe regained the crown.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, dropped a tee shot in the water at the 16th hole of the par-3 and gave the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari is one of only four players to win 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament, when the current tournament rules were applied, and has shone in every round.
The American Jordan Spies lost 5&4 to European team runner-up, Denmark's Tobias Olsen.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup match.
The eight-time Ryder Cup champion, Spain's Sergio Garcia, has scored 25.5 career points, making him the most successful European athlete in the competition's history.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
So happy, I'm so happy to have the trophy back.
"It's for the team, and I'm happy to help", said Garcia, who was overwhelmed by the European team win.
He gives a sex to the Spanish golfer John Ram, who defeated the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a fast-food game on Sunday.
I'm so proud to say that I'm not a fan of Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching Woods play", said Ram, 23.
Woods has been eliminated in four matches in the Ryder Cup in France and currently has a 13-21-3 overall record in the Ryder Cup.
The second-most major titles behind Jack Nicklaus, 14 major titles, but that's a strange statistic from one of the greatest players in history.
The U.S. team struggled to get the ball to the fairway all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-performance golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
This morning we had a time of some pressure on Europe.
We were defeated.
I pay my respects to Thomas.
He's a great team leader.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to rebuild the team and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You must pay your respects.
The other team played better".
Reduced concentrations in the Red Sea, Pinilla, Manate, Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that the concentration of redfish is generally declining in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the commission, red squirrels are being observed in the area of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, indicating that concentrations are declining.
The Red River runs along about 130 miles of coastline from Pine Ridge in the north to Lee County in the south.
The red-cockaded woodpecker fragments were found about 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but in a smaller area than last week.
Red-winged blackbirds were also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there were moderate concentrations in Pinellas County, low or high concentrations in Hillsborough County, high or near peak concentrations in Manatee County, high or near peak concentrations in Sarasota County and coastal areas, near peak or near peak concentrations in Charlotte County, high or near peak concentrations in Lee County and coastal areas, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory illnesses continue to be reported in Painela, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory illness was reported in northwest Florida last week.
