Barack Obama will be the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth US president in history.
The diploma, medal and cheque for $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for their exceptional efforts in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning and they will have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the committee that, in October, selected him from 172 individuals and 33 organisations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, though the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that when he receives the award, he will speak about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid the subject, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts were further increased by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
He's planning to donate the paraffin to charity, but he hasn't decided yet which organization.
During the entire programme, the President and his wife will attend a banquet, as well as the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the award.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not being fully deserving.
He also repeated several times that the award is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Nature advocate charged with blackmail
The Litoměřice police have charged the chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders with blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction license procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Society for the Protection of Nature is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can sort out beverage containers and in villages in southern Moravia, you can find containers to sort out trash everywhere.
What about Brno?
There they need several minutes to find their respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno there is no sorting of garbage at all.
It seems to me that, for the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for this waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle down the middle into the right container?
It's almost impossible, and above all it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is on Moravské náměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
I don't want Mr Onderka and his colleagues to be angry with me, but that seems too little.
Needless to say, it is not easy to separate garbage elsewhere either.
That's why a lot of my friends prefer not to break it up.
By vacant
What's going on is the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Luckily, I found the right spot by taking the tram.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It's still the centre of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
The problem is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey superleague, which is a disgrace to us all over the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad I can compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire region of Jihomoravský kraj.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from the rents and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government's opinion, adds funds for farmers or civil servants, there may not be enough money in the budget for rent, sickness benefits or building savings.
But neither for interest on the national debt nor for international litigation.
This will hurt all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they relied on the government to later ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rent or sickness benefits.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay ever higher interest and eventually you have to pay back the money.
The state doesn't have many options for getting money.
If you don't reduce social security or state operating expenses, you have to raise taxes.
All those who have been added by the left now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children too.
People don't have to worry about income or sick pay, they'll get it.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year the treasury will be short not only of $163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to rise along with the interest expenses.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer come by slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity subsidies, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocation of money to benefit some groups of voters, next year there will also be a shortfall of five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are mainly sectors where the tender has already been opened and the construction process has already begun, where the projects cannot be changed or the price reduced.
The best we can do is preserve them, which is not free either.
This means that the 30 large projects are delayed or stopped; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution to the decrease in funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is majority owned by the State, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe, nor is it a bottomless pit.
Last year, ČEZ's budget was set at 18 billion.
Each year dividends are used to pay for ecological damage, to complete the income account or to provide a reserve for the planned income reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to provide various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including in building savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international lawsuit, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, in the worst case, make use of the government budget reserve.
The State Box, which is worth two billion and has already been started, is also a hundred million short of what it should be possible to monitor online what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a button, switch between various operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just one key press, they go from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is precisely the aim of the American company VMware, which is mainly focused on developing virtualization software for computers.
You can carry two user profiles on your mobile at once.
You can switch between them and split them between home and work.
Both operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in the year 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, run simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It's not just ski keepers in the Krkonoše who are worried about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book skiing accommodation in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, free rooms can still be obtained on all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud", said the maintainer of the informative portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend their New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn should not hesitate to book a room.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hotels in Špindlerův Mlýn mainly offer weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll keep offering them, but they'll soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute holiday stays", said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer the New Year's Eve on Krkonoše, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days of February are also very well sold, the remaining winter dates are regularly sold.
This year the interest in winter stays is hampered by the lack of snow on Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowbound during the week, the Christmas dates will be sold out too,' says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy rooms at the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last of the seats available.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well", reported the manager of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the New Year's Eve rooms are already occupied at the Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds are still available.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at about sixty percent capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in staying in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the manager of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the moment it seems that hotel owners in Krkonoše will get tired of waiting for snow.
Thursday temperatures should drop and if there is rain, it should snow in the mountains.
But then temperatures will rise again, reports Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest man, like a diligent student repeats on the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it turned out to be a copy of the script Bush used for Iraq, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "as in Iraq" used several times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new way forward".
It was he who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, a country suffering from civil war, calling it "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, proved that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is no mention of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively it left his successor with a much more favourable starting position than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a repeat of the miracle.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, most notably the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he fooled the general about 10,000 troops.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had previously counted on at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of the whole Obama strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respecting agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is being honoured.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing their commander every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to the confused relations, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shattered by his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will view it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what relation the security of Germany or Italy has to the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, which can radically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
The answers will have to be sought precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential election and therefore there is still plenty of time to find another strategy, if this one proves a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer road it must take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly $300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, probably exceeds, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion dollars.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the onset of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax bank bonuses over 25,000 pounds (about CZK 712,000) at a one-time rate of fifty percent.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in every category except physics.
Five women, a record number, received this year's Nobel Prizes in literature and specialised categories from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among the laureates.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ada Jonath of Israel and Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz of the United States for their explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, went to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a female winner, was Physics.
This prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and telescopes.
Each laureate received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to SEK 10 million (approximately SEK 25 million).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is shared among them.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of being awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the minister of finance Eduard Janota, who is considering his permanence in the government, as he is not in agreement with the version of the state budget for the next year, approved on Wednesday by the chamber of deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota's continuing in the cabinet, are supposed to be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
The Commission has also taken a number of measures to improve the efficiency of the internal market.
The meeting was reported by the spokesman of the president Radim Ochvat.
On his continuation in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which Klaus is preparing to sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved the left's proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the Social Democrats' proposals, as they are covertly increasing the budget deficit.
A serious internal political conflict arose between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians have long been ignoring "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He says they don't have a good solution anymore.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS vice-president Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences".
The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular were happy too.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggles and victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, played the leader of the abolitionist movement who ended up a slave, the fictional US president, and even God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation is still racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and so he decides to unite rugby players, who belong in a global measure to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story into theaters.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was speaking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that by shaking your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling that I know how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the white-dominated rugby team.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby world.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller".
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of Oscar ambitions.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film".
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received a 76 percent positive rating.
The secret of the splendour over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry finally acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again, and the Bulava missile, once intended to be the pride of the Russian military, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even their repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, didn't fly out or there was a failure in the air.
The Russian newspapers write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but it shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, there were again technical problems with the aircraft.
The engine probably blew up in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows it to be launched from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
So it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the beginning to believe that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that you can't just talk about failure.
The first two stages of the missile held and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately at the first stage.
Although none of the launches were completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defence management only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and so they continue to claim that "Bulavá" will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at the age of 51 with CSKA Moscow .
Legendary defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov will be back in the pros at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play in the KHL's game against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defense attorney.
Fetisov practices constantly and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to sort out some formal issues, AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It's still unclear if the famous player's return will be for one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice, he will become the longest-serving professional hockey player in Russia.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the Fetisov Five famous players, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the unions.
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime work.
The unions declared an emergency strike on Monday because of the frequent overtime.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign ourselves to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential, which is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday 19 December, i.e. it will be done in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who work the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can claim the bonus for overtime or take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped the manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two hours more in addition to the eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted practically every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the emergency strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is to take place on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday, that if they commit to meeting the requirements and the document is signed, they are ready to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent overtime.
They also protested against the poor pay conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that the employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as overtime is concerned, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production started last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a drug effective even on 'strayed' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective on a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already available.
AIDS is not curable yet.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly extended by a combination of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from replicating in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University shows that it is possible to overcome virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that is different from all the drugs used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, improved compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the albumin of the virus.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation would not occur and mature, infectious virus corpuscles would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still being systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective.
Testing of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of the metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The unique effect mechanism, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications make metallocarbons interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defended himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "appalling" and that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were marked by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say it leaves time for analysis.
ODS vice-president Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas the prime minister has to decide whether in the chamber of deputies he wants to support the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased the money for state officials' salaries, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has criticized the ODS proposals, which cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should be running a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and the feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were adopted, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, he's thinking about staying on the job.
The reason is their disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do with the nominees of the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the House passes other bills that increase the deficit, for example those concerning sickness benefits, pensions, or the amendment to the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the fight against the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies".
However, this will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I have not thought about it, when the time comes, I will take care of it, defence minister Martin Barták told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies, who was appointed to the government precisely by ODS members.
Prime Minister Fischer left for a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS ceded at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the chamber of deputies would probably vote against the modified budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask ODS deputies to allow the acceptance of the budget.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which are to be included in the new programme.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from office he knew that the next few months would be mostly about bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will run at almost the same fares
Czech Railways will cancel or restrict some less-used local and high-speed trains from 13 December and reinforce some links.
The total traffic will be reduced by two per cent compared with today, after the new train schedule comes into force.
Most rates including the base and customer price will not change.
More connections to the capital will be made possible, for example, by the residents of the Ostravsko region, and a pendulum train will be added to this line.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not run to Bratislava again.
The number of express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced and direct links between Prague and Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest planned reduction in transport by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight per cent in total, while transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route will also be cancelled and some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava by Pendolino.
Regional railway bill this year: 200 million more than before
The rapid trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast and local dráhy trains they have a new contract of ten years, until now the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why the prices of a vast majority of the tickets have not increased.
The changes will only occur on the one-day tickets - ČD Net and on the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card the ČD Net price will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was a single price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipinos continue to detain over 50 people, children released
Armed men have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP news agency, which previously reported only 65 abductions.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say about 19 gunmen are using the hostages as a human shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP news agency, the police had previously pursued the kidnappers due to violence, which was caused by the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province, martial law was imposed because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor's election, were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of RSA is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, directed by Clint Eastwood, Invictus (official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), will be released in US cinemas, capturing a part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela is here.
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk's, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The report, which is expected to be released in the coming days, is a major step forward as South Africa prepares for the World Cup, and the media is shaken by alarming news of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the country's predominantly black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film at RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against casting the lead roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well for it.
I met Nelson Mandela many times in person, to - as they say - recharge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns the whole world, he added.
In the rugby team uniform
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, titled In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field.
For entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela won a great ovation fourteen years ago, especially from the white public and recognition from the white inhabitants.
The soccer championship may succeed in helping people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
We'll see if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans are however skeptical, as stated for example in a recent interview with LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is burning
The fire caught a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the fire brigade in the Ústí region, the fire is being extinguished by six groups.
Previously, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however later they changed their mind and the fire is being extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, a short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company spokeswoman, the malfunction does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, it will not be possible to enumerate exactly before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesperson for ČEZ for Northern Czech Republic, the electricity supply was not cut off, and the fire at the power substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as sole maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switchboxes with 67 transformers, which carry electrical energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, and also maintains the 4339-kilometer-long electrical conduction.
Jančura will file a complaint for slander against three ČSSD hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura will today file a complaint for slander against three social democratic hetmans.
These are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the Hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand is related to the company's effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins out of the cake", yet we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Drah, which is not true.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander against the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also said that the Commission had the evidence from all regions and that the necessary measures had not been taken in line with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint to be a continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and himself.
I am naturally prepared to defend my good name and that of my region and I call on the other Hetmans to do the same.
I suppose that also on this occasion it will be clearly shown that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, which would aim to warn of these measures by the regions.
He told Radiožurnál, that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kroner they did not call a tender.
According to Jančura, such steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a ČSSD MP, because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He ran as a ČSSD deputy, I know, which gentleman it is, I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumocoke vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine, it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are in full swing.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts have also made this clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born on or after August 2 of the previous year will be able to receive the neumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth month of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily stopped vaccinating their children against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Generally, experts estimate, that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent on all the vaccination of children about 500 thousand annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
According to the research, 28 children under 10 years of age die from pneumoconiosis in our country every year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, at the same time there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January, you must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, said Rudolf Kalovský, head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their partnership has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to be able to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovský said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcus.
At the moment we are not thinking about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the paediatric society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a large amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnochová.
Experts hope that by next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies get pneumococcal vaccines.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment later, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MEPs were, however, afraid that insurance companies might "take the money out of health insurance".
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they're paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will spend 40,000 a month on vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "a museum robbery"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been charged with trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania State Police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
They claim Frazetta and another man used a bulldozer to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a depot".
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
Labour Party defends tax increases in budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show his seriousness about deficit cutting, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Social Security is a rage
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems".
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations to the Council.
Social security with an additional 0.5 % increase, from April 2011
The economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1 point increase in corporation tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would rise by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and whoever earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 a year will gain £110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60 percent of the additional tax burden would fall on the top 5 percent of wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax hikes and spending cuts were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers. It will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the Finance Minister was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he claimed that the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour Party's "debt crisis", said the £789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" dodging difficult options until after the elections due in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do", said the Shadow Minister for Finance, Philip Hammond.
All important announcements will be made after the elections, whoever wins wins"
Roger Bootle, from Deloitte.
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction in the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as the inflationary rise in some disability benefits next April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to accusations of election rigging, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the people most in need and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment in public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the figures from the Minister of Finance implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
"This is really putting the pain off", said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins wins", added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte accountants.
"This was the fake pre-budget report.
FBI investigates "arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information on the men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges they have been arrested on and the kind of circumstances in which they are being held", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing", the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained at a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already under the sights of local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the US needed to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported them missing in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses" against women
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have been equally deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details the regime's "abuse patterns" before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticism has a political basis.
The thousands of arrests and dozens of killings in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC's correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election result.
"I'm often hit in the face", in his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who claimed he was held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and the parliamentary committee's findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to convert a Bristol landmark into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-meter-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the runway, but that it was quite frightening.
Below you can see a beautiful view of the city lights twinkling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent", he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon's event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on minarets and there is widespread alarm about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and thoroughly argued study of a problem that divided and troubled the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims of France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students on the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legal for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They can't get this argument out in the open.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are probably treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he perceives an adjustment of values".
After reading this book, one tends to say, 'Yes, but not yet.'"
The world's most desolate scene
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, transport and fishing interests have focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence.
In On Thin Ice, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their courage in the face of the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the tip of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The cubs, caught swimming along the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, featured 75 polar bears at once.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still usually one-millionth the area of a wild adult's range. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore turned green by algae growing inside the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis turns to accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the United States, and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile-riding Eskimo Indians use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunter nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a startling look at how the future of the Arctic can be transformed.
It's not like scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the submarines of the Cold War drew a map of the shifting chords of ice circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite surveys and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of salt water that compress as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders inside, they're all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... this could be us .
Marines among 6,000 laying wreaths at Arlington's graves
Pft. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we're being shipped, this could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at veterans' graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is now an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year, stopping in different cities along the way to officiate events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at graves in Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career military man.
Until her husband is buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of paying back those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way for civilians to support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don't get as many visitors as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as children played and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine tree to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars overwhelmed the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on one another in the freezing air.
Some read out loud names carved into the stones, while others stooped to see small black and white plaques placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes at her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. My son paid for it, he said.
"Long after I'm dead, I want someone to remember him".
Cuban officials arrested a US government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was distributing cell phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protest and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a nascent blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a US contractor is likely to cause tensions between the Castro brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to break the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Cell phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are used mainly for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available at expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and at some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug trafficking.
Berbena said he couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, like handing out free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself", a reference to Raúl Castro's placement as the country's leader, to replace his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel a vast network of terrorist recruiters, who scour the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were hunting a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them had made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and their terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah failed to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the delicate nature of the case.
The official said the men were not immobile and were even trying to get proper clearance to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determining who they trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people into al Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not letting through those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking at aspiring American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization, they represent a huge draw, because of their potential to gain access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It's transformed into a much more Web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate "action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center take bolder action on climate.
The protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city holding banners that said in English, "There is no Planet B", and one in Spanish that declared, "Earth says enough is enough".
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that trips to Peru, her mother's home country, made her aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening".
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mostly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for his involvement in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black attire placed several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is near several ministries.
They were around buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I was really not aware of the situation".
Then he continued in Mandarin, "Because the meeting place is so large, I cannot hear what is happening outside".
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the public in general and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or other people's freedom.
Data from a test reveals persistent racial differences
The federal grade booklet last week on math performance was very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best performing systems in the country, the report card showed that fourth and eighth graders have strode at a faster pace over the past two years than the cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what's being recorded in recent figures from the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent performance gap between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth graders in D.C. over the past two years, rose from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-Americans in eighth grade remained essentially flat, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the white people were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year span, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was released, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has narrowed to just 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping for a two- or three-point lead, said D.C. Councilman Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By-election), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city's high schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what's worrying is that we're not devoting the time and energy necessary to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and middle school who did not master the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Math, a kindergarten through sixth grade math curriculum that emphasizes games and real-life experiences, was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here's a kind of a grim dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to direct its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
The objective can then have political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other city supervisors, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on making sure we build a great school system.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that every family, no matter where they live, can have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in closing the achievement gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year on a year of 185 days, which she sees as an "indicator" to seek a larger increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, came down and blinked for a moment at the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had just graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Gee, seriously? he said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school's low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh visit the children had made on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed its deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States to Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable feat given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico and Central America, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers claim, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who analyze high-achievers say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents lack the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's university tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going on to college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies walked away having bid on only two of the 10 fields being auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for auctioned fields in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It'll be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military retreats, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more aggressive risks in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest oil reserve, analysts said.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have forged close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corporation of China bid on more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on the way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman of the Petroleum Ministry Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit bids made bids which were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
Al Qaeda's top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan.
An alleged U.S. missile strike on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA, inside Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official from Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner, who directed the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was engaged in conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of US airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering their central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from the top leadership of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name familiar to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking operatives.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
The top UN envoy in Kabul about to resign
The UN's top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous mandate marred by accusations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, to collaborate with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said she was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise she made to her family in March 2008 to spend just two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it is better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I first came here, there was a gap of two months between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test by his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide denied the accusations, but said the allegations by Galbraith, who was fired, "surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the UN's cumbersome hiring regulations undermined his ability to recruit talent.
So UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for its failure to engage in talks over its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it's the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would take "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer greatly" from sanctions.
In a statement Friday from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the directives of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, it indicated that it would renegotiate the restriction of its nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of engaging with the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran's toughening up with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October, has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they haven't been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including going ahead with what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions".
In a statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless and baseless accusations" on Thursday from some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. plans, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon you".
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave".
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city's low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We've already given all our time and energy just for one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy became effective, according to the Division of Child Health and Family Services.
The UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labor shortages".
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden", he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to preventing critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the policy's imposition.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they toned down many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University's Institute of Demographic Research, said that central government officials have been discussing even more sweeping changes recently, such as allowing couples to have two children if one spouse is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the signs that ordered families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slip leaflets under the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Planned Parenthood officials say the response has been very unoverwhelming.
Disappointing Answer
Although officials in a rural city outside Shanghai claim they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban districts show no change.
Huinan Municipality, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to only reach about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai's Caolu Municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want the best for their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yeah, they're robbing us of the ability to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political question.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said that she wants an only child because she too was an only child: "We were the center of our families and were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others".
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two careers, middle class, who reduce the birth rate, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategist "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycare when the child is 9 months old".
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by defiant stances and mutual recriminations, drew renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that envisions ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations bearing the brunt of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and outlined the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not say how much money rich countries would give to poor countries to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of global temperature rise that policy makers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by between 25 and 45 percent, compared with 1990 levels, while the major developing countries would cut theirs over the same period by between 15 and 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated conversations over the past week.
The US special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims that call for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line on China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense", or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States clashing over their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world's 24 most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the boldest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are arguing over who should pay for the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in trying to hold big emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say the talks will at most produce a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has "put political pressure on the whole political process", in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
Talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government can reach a deal.
High-level officials, including Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, got off the planes and rushed to the Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to delineate claims to be arbitrated over the next week.
The total disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and exit the convention center every day, activists playing guitar perform nightly shows mocking countries they say are selling out, and preliminary proposals are passed hand-to-hand instead of via email), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 140-mile-an-hour train redefines that feeling of Monday.
At 5.13am on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h when it passes like a lightning bolt from Ashford, Kent, to St Pancras station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of State for Transport, will be joined later by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first long-distance Javelin service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching from planes and cars to railways would reduce national carbon emissions as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, all three major political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, may still hold back Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times has learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan shall be drawn within a 25 m radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would split in or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Only one line would go into Scotland.
It seems this will be the most beneficial option", said a railway member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open until 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400 metre long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston Station offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but a wide public consultation and planning procedures mean a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if he starts the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first trains would be forced to leave the express lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a switch from airplanes to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face the mortgage on a £75,000 orange tree owned by a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in the house in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living on "rations", increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the requests in good time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members' expenses.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses nearby have sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange grove".
Neighbors described it as a "greenhouse for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry into his previous mortgage deals.
Last month, the committee cleared him of violating the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan exchanged the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage on his London property for the house in his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest, up to March last year.
In April, their claims rose to over £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at that time, suggesting that the entire increase was to finance the £75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate at which it now stands.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan was still asking for £1,250 a month in May.
Mr Duncan lost his job as opposition leader of the House in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "on rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like a dick".
He said: I spend my money on my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't".
The MP, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound symbol in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest, after it was revealed he had been begging for £4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved by both the payroll office and later by Legg".
He added: It's not about dodging and delinquent or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the bounds, by the rules, authorized and all.
It could not be any clearer or simpler".
Come, you who have faith, to see the calendar of the advent of the Brighton beach palapa.
Brighton's palaps have found new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests being able to see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled cakes and punch served free of charge.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant in Hove, is an unpaid clergyman in the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated: We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society".
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to an old strange building?
The idea for the advent calendar of the palapa started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we're trying to try and represent that through spirituality".
Massive climate mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police, hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital demanding an agreement that the UN Climate Change Conference must reach by Friday, which would come into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, said the growing global climate mobilisation represented by these demonstrations had contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with cobbles and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to them, mainly members of the Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and sitting despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and headed for the Bella Center, the venue for the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers, and former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most in blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we took to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot keep saying: there is time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, waterways that you can walk on like you never could before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure in the anti-globalization movement, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which includes many islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters gathered to demand strong action on climate change.
In France, demonstrations organised by the 350 network drew hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, though Georgia denounces "fraud"
Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected a president on Saturday; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war over control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 5pm GMT.
According to officials of the Electoral Commission of Abkhazia, turnout was 58% a few hours before the closing.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday night.
The five candidates in the race, including outgoing president Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the vote count.
This election is a sham.
The European Union has also expressed its concern about the situation in Abkhazia, which is under the control of the Russian Federation.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After seceding from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia is trying to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who walked to the polling station at a school in the capital, Sukhumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central issue of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch next to Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in different locations in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to monitor the development of the vote.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow for its support, and very particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be recognized by the United Nations quickly, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his vodka glass.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current government or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand an ambitious and binding deal ahead of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around a massive demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the cold in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers, and former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
Moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and stepped in with a firm hand, throwing several of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was hit in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, police said.
We are not taking our eyes off extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as police helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most in blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we took to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalization figure, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
Oxfam, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which includes many islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, dressed in red and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy demonstrated in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters gathered to demand action on climate change.
In France, demonstrations organised by the 350 network drew hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to be broadcast in the Informativo on Sunday (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of secondary education in general, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all first-year students will have four hours a week and the same programme for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "enough hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls the best students".
The General and Literary Education branches cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to say: "I have not heard that historians or intellectuals are outraged that they have eliminated history and geography in secondary school in technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in secondary school.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from the secondary program of bachelor's C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which sacrifices, according to them, the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give a test of admission that will be aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, a test of admission on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also do practical work during the M2 year, after which they will spend a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal High School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, opened the "Ernest" lecture round, a day of fifteen-minute expert presentations filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of the conference, as the students baptized the fish in the school pond.
We selected about 20 participants from among the experts in their field and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, who presented without notes but with the help of graphs in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping the public would understand that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier'.
Videos filmed during these lectures will be online on the school's website from December 15.
The next Ernest Day is scheduled for February, followed by other days every two months.
Delay in payments: displeasure among prison guards, action planned
The prison guards' unions called for a "general mobilisation" on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year holidays, of bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers' Force (the 2nd guards union) asked staff outside the service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their belongings.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", because it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guards union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Penitentiary Administration and the Justice Ministry explain that the overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
Later in the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the Directorate of Prison Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation caused by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be meager, except for the staff of the direction who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary demands", Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and public holidays if the October ones are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we have more tasks and missions without more staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux estimates.
According to the unions, this is not the case in all regions, as some are more fortunate than others.
But in any case, the result is not what was expected, said Ufap's secretary general, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Christmas with his family in the White House, told the famous television host Oprah Winfrey that she came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive".
During a special interview that ABC will air Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holiday season at their new prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will receive "of course" a gift, according to excerpts from the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "By no means, I gave you nice gifts last year", she said, teasing the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before he humorously answered, pointing at the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous entertainer who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two gears, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time my dad came to visit us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the first lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in a line against the wall, instead of arranging it around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was put into an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-intervened Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where doctors found "operation-induced injuries" to a herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his press service in the city said, saying the injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical team would be contacted within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be put into an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula was introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic in Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for a few days ago, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic community.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection stemming from Delajoux's surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but he said there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was stupid to take a 12-hour flight after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure by claiming that Johnny Hallyday, "reacts satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection is "under control".
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for "colon cancer", after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been exaggerated, with fans and journalists noting the musician's difficulty moving around the stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title at his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the 2009 World Championships in long course, won an international title on Thursday in a distance he feels special affection for, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane bathing suits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in 4 x 50 m 4 styles relay (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, a mark he holds in long course (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20'53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first at international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better, and in that case, I said if the world record was within my grasp, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits which will be banned from 1 January.
These swimmers, who have set 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same event.
This time the use of swimming trunks did not help the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in long course swimming this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his 400 m freestyle mark (3:32.77), but won with the second-best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up completely in this race.
I knew I couldn't break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfil my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a panel of Zola's sarcophagus sold for $1.5 million
A panel of a Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 6 feet (2.0 m) long and 2 feet (63 cm) high, dates to the third century C.E. Its price was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It sold out in about a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot has been the most bid for by buyers, without a doubt, a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Paris mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about 50 years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure for Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico said conditions were not in place to transfer Honduras' ousted president, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe passage by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, declared the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to his place of origin, according to a source at the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him safe passage, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the deposed president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign (...), they wanted me to present my resignation", Zelaya said on Thursday on radio Globo, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for a safe passage, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain a request for asylum, declared the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, to Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Telesur network, which is based in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military, on Wednesday.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
This reflects the marginal character of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, which was rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial vote, Porfirio Lobo was elected, an election recognized by the United States but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We're getting good news from different sectors of the economy, said FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the glass half full".
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners said investors were focused on the US trade balance, "which reflects an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The trade deficit of the United States fell in October by 7.6% compared with September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
Analysts were expecting a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, with 474,000 applications filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "was the lowest in a year", stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has crashed.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4,492% against 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of the Cuban government booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the world human rights day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were called.
Some forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they marched towards the centre of the capital demanding the release of the detainees, an AFP journalist said.
"Death to the Yankees!", "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raúl!"
The latter were escorted by officers dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the international day of human rights were stopped by plainclothes police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forcibly put the dissidents in vehicles that were booed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in such circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", who won the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, had organised an unauthorised march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is among the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call the opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" hired by their declared enemy, the United States.
In a rare media event, Cuban television reported on the demonstration Thursday by government militants against the "counterrevolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European and American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially freedom of expression.
An outsider kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday afternoon at rush hour.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker, would have struck with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly man,in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of the Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses reported.
The 1929-born man died in hospital from his severe injuries, according to an official with the Alliance police union.
Later at the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, in his mid-30's, got in the way and was injured.
The first two victims, both seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other wounded, with his vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then fainted and was admitted "in shock", a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, escaped along Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently by chance, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a man in his thirties, and another in his forties seriously.
By nightfall, the crime scene was still unsolved.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried crossed on his back, explained a union official in the Altos del Sena, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alienated man, according to the testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They failed because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to stop the gunman and were wounded in a fight, according to police testimony.
The incident occurred on one of the main roads in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I felt a very serious wound in his abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identification.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office has submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his pre-trial detention, he hasn't said a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of him being committed to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "any deranged person of this type whose forces increase considerably under the effect of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer for Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has again demanded that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) over a case of sexual abuse that took place more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", testified before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal about serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: "I demand that at this very moment the charges be dismissed, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, was 'chilling.'
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before handing down sentence, which constitutes a serious procedural error.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared in late September that he had "lied" to the documentary's author.
Hummel demanded a trial to allow him to present evidence of his argument if the court refused to dismiss the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "needs to be here to perform at the hearing".
With this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of escape?
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, even though he despises its authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel wasn't the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded, once again, that the case be closed.
He claims that his client can no longer bear to be harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down on the dollar's rise.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday, in a market that is torn between better indicators than those predicted in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technology component, lost 0,55 points to stand at 2,190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index, which has been expanded, rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains narrowly marginalised, the volume of trade is shrinking and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion as to the strength of the economic recovery", Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and were higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan's index.
However, the indices were held back by a further advance of the dollar to the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "is driving down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has crashed.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4,497% against 4,492% the day before.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are on the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this grand celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already reached the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were all voted Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during their time in Africa.
It was a real bustle.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and experienced so many things!" said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
The ninth edition of the race will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday at 17h15 GMT.
I can't think of a better country to present my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very glad to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breathtaking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World contestants are focused on the pageant.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, the 2000 winner and current candidate, and Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will be marching in traditional dresses and, of course, in swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a Miss World committee official Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa has shown itself capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates went on safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on bicycles, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exception, they met the South African President, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone observes.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (South West) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd meet.
She will probably be back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", his son David said Friday as he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he stepped off the plane from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.
The singer's son, distended, said he would be moved "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection derived from the operation of herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put into a medically induced coma at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated on again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries from the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles, where his daughter Jade attends, to witness a school function, a photographer for AFP confirmed.
The head of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer has violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic of Parque Monceau, in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
There's talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice for herniated disc, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he said the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also intervened on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the courts several times for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "a man without scruples" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said that the operation "went smoothly" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage", he added.
Anyway, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, went into a hiatus.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky, Camus declared.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Acquisition Offer) on the former Giscardist party's signet, instructing him to withdraw it from all support, on pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having reached out to him to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As a support to its management, it received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it in the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF association office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy, urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the ownership rights of the brand, under pain of a court case.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you were going to propose that your political movement reclaim the UDF acronym, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the letter's signatories say.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that demands that the NC remove "immediately the mention of the UDF name from all media, as well as from (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate rightholders".
If not, the signatories warn that they will appeal to the justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It is scandalously and fraudulently taking advantage of the lack of registration of the acronym UDF to do so on its own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more dignified to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of power
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of the octogenarian's state of weakness to rob her of a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of show stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of power, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a saga-worthy trial of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fighting over the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered that 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think he'll take it.
I will speak to her, Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the courtroom.
The Court of Justice has ruled that the Commission has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 85 (1) of the Treaty.
It is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' arguments proved, on occasion, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she stated that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I never spoke to Françoise again".
The Office of the Prosecutor of Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was unable to appear, especially since a guardianship judge had refused, in recent days, to grant her request to open a guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'is fully competent to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No one else will be able to appear in his place", said the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers once the judgment had been delivered.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our struggle to develop business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees was reminiscent of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it was a matter of employees adhering to "values" determined from above, just as before it was a matter of imposing on consumers products devised by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the enterprise, the marketing revolution gave way to market-conquering strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products unrelated to customer preference factors is regularly repeated.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much broader phenomenon which particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, especially R & D and even more so business intelligence.
Indeed, BI "requires proactive behavior and forward-looking thinking from all parties involved" and requires a commitment from employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for a managerial revolution, which would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls are of relative use
Will internal opinion polls, such as the Orange questionnaire among its employees, spur the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not. I'm not going to.
- In principle, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially what they have always done!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
They come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory that American "neuroscience" has recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media have widely promoted behind their backs.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management stance, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilizing factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the smooth running of modern enterprises involves adopting a finalistic view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating into all business management reasoning and practice a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of making part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivation.
Studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring the mobilizing factors, business managers can monitor, forecast and anticipate their 'social performance' and relocate human resource management 'on the spot'.
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the organised development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from right-wingers for "just war"
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner has defended the concept of "just war" against America's enemies, hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama's award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Mrs. Palin, a leading figure on the right wing of the Republican Party, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted himself Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered the president to have done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives was happy, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" remind the Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not hand over a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current columnist for the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world", as he "always does", he "spoke like a North American president" by reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few leftists not so convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and uninspired" on the Internet site National Review Online.
To the president's left, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, though still believing Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "overproduced" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California newspaper enthusiastically commented.
Obama "gave the speech that was needed", said The New York Times, calling it "both bleak and uplifting".
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organisation to stay until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the state secretary of transportation, Dominique Bussereau, was "joyful" about the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left at dawn on Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text of the agreement late in the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew with a bang.
But a meeting of more than six hours which began at 11 a.m. was necessary to get everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the New Year's celebrations", Bussereau said.
The text provides for a 4% increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest (in international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8,72 euros to 9,06 for low-wage workers.
It's not much, but we started out with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants to stop cutting and blocking supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low-wage workers and 100 to 120 euros for those with higher wages.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognised it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel expenses and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible to address in particular the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "under the same conditions".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to the companies belonging to this organisation and, secondly, to the whole profession, should the Minister for Labour extend it.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers' organisations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced it as a "naïve business", as the €100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to avoid upsetting those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, Unostra lamented.
The agreement, the OTRE said, risks 'the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months'.
RER A: weekend conflicts, unions opposed to RATP proposals
Conflicts on the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between unions and the RATP management, no agreement was reached and the unions were dissatisfied with their demand for a bonus.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, trains will only run between 10am and 8pm on Saturday and Sunday, with one train every two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were happy that "the RATP strives to provide service to large stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the city of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains ran during rush hour, and almost no trains during low-frequency hours, as had been planned.
Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Île de France.
Thus, at dawn, the station in Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger, Val-de-Marne, Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up "an hour and a half earlier to be on time".
The station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned police and law enforcement oversight.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the metro.
New general assemblies of striking workers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to discuss the results, "not satisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol on all aspects of RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the new rules.
The RATP even put its proposals for a premium in parentheses, the CGT said indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned for Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession", RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company "did not care about weekend users".
In the morning, about 150 drivers stormed a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who had refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Indépendants have filed a notice.
The unions are asking for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this line which has a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second stage of their professional career, charge between EUR 2 200 and EUR 2 700 gross and between EUR 600 and EUR 650 premiums, for alternating shift times, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the proxy party, a decision with grave consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of dissolving the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked anger in the Kurdish community, the country's southeast and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermine the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are barred from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the termination of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament before becoming non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision follows a 2007 case brought by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, accusing the DTP of following the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims it has no "organic ties" to the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's ruling comes at a time when the government is reaching out to the Kurdish community with a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds will stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement threw tear gas and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or sling stones.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people also gathered.
After the verdict, Türk said the court's decision would "deepen the discouragement".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
We are against closing games in principle.
This does not solve anything, stated the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something that makes life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with it, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
Maybe this weekend the weathermen will announce it for the first time.
Over 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with the snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snows heavily in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below freezing, 20 of the so-called A-sections with large salt trucks leave, explains Brauburger.
This includes, for example, major arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping sections, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet, better-adhesive salt.
That's why the FES starts around three in the morning, "with the tracks being clear until the rush hour traffic starts".
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem", says the winter road maintenance manager, "because then nobody is ready to clear space for salted vehicles".
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is the turn of the secondary and private roads, to which also the Rat-Beil-Straße belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble comes, you know, Brauburger.
Around five in the morning, the FES infantry is deployed, clearing mainly the dangerous points and cruisers.
The ESF could not normally take over all the bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt, a special service runs from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. and keeps a close eye on bridges, says Brauburger.
Because these quickly become slippery, the salted vehicle is started as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call you.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs - a six-foot-long [2.0 m] animal that ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this one wouldn't have been anything special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in the journal Science on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began in 2006 an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we find a dozen dinosaur bones in a day - an unprecedented feat for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected the remains of five specimens in total.
A new discovery confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
Sterling Nesbitt says it is an exceptional find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments".
Other dinosaur experts do not share that enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods, which include Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long-neck" and their relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (saurians with bird pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air sacs, such as those found in the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air sacs, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related lineage of later giant sauropods also possessed air sacs and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the earliest dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers infer that the dinosaurs first appeared there.
Thus, the three genealogical lineages initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa hallae the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
All three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His view may be distorted, for simply in South America many dinosaur fossils remain preserved, while on other continents there is little to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral lineage of reptiles to the dominant land vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains a mystery.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while the kin became extinct at the Triassic to Jurassic boundary.
Success stories didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles didn't.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat their rivals in the area.
Success stories aren't always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halted the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
The conference is attended by professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna and Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen are taking part.
The police eviction of the occupied casino at Goethe University in Frankfurt has had repercussions around the world.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building taken over by students and teachers on strike evacuated last week, because the walls and artwork were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories say, does not justify "the violent disbandment of courses organized by the students and professors themselves by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The focus on vandalism served to "delegitimise and criminalize protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The board of directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the court claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The Verdi youth union and the German Trade Union Federation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister for Science in Hessen, however, defended the actions of the university rector and the police.
We're grateful to the president of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday at the Wiesbaden Provincial Parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a delegate to the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the students' arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, asking the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow's ten districts, was a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the community of 216,000, located 23 miles [37 km] from downtown Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Selenograd have been in contact with the Riedberg Scientific Headquarters in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The two sides have made several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg are signing a 'Protocol of close cooperation' in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov, and was signed by planning services chief Edwin Schwarz from Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural sciences research centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The IFC companies will have the possibility to set foot on the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were established.
Brakes from Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not at all high enough.
For the proponents of the project it is simply the 'new heart of Europe'.
The S21 law is much more than a reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate a decade of chaos in the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region from hopeless construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which terminate in the middle of the city, were considered at the time to be 19th-century engineering fossils, acting as brakes on modern rail traffic, as formerly it took a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives backwards and forwards.
Roll, stop, keep going, but that's the way it has to be.
And that's why the terminals in Frankfurt and Munich had to disappear.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located approximately halfway along the transEuropean lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan 'Heart of Europe'.
The S21 will indeed be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement reduction.
The rail terminals of course have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reverse locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the newly built ICE section to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and local politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not the State.
From an urbanist point of view, the project is still justified to a certain extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer's computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
Back then, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
But modern transport policy must first of all focus on strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains because of the steep gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts say it's more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other crossroads and narrow passages in the network.
In total sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of over 180 kilometres of long railway tracks through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the gas properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport ruling.
The Federal Government is waiting in the Wiesbaden regional parliament to decide whether to appeal the Hessian Administrative Court's decision to ban night flights.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts to investigate the VGH's 400-page judgment, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had stated in writing on that date that in the case of the planned construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the Land would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to appeal this ruling.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressured government representatives to drop the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and FDP to honour their pledges to ban night flights before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of word.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep one's word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination that the federal government would be trying through misrepresentations of the law and tricks to still get their night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a while.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally impeccable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition stands, it would never have been the case with your group's claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks are paying back the aid they've given.
The big American banks, shaken by the crisis, are shedding their state bonds.
Bank of America repaid the aid granted by the Tarp bank rescue fund in a single payment of a total of EUR 45 billion (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by CNBC in the United States.
The aim of this is to free the institutions from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised approximately 19 billion in liquidity through convertible bonds.
The rest of the money he took from the box itself, which had plenty of means, including from selling items.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked Wednesday night especially the American taxpayers: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of absorbing the investment bank at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money on the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the State.
CNBC reported from a source familiar with the matter that the American bank could announce a 20 billion dollar capital increase as early as Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, they had already paid back their loans to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick selection
In the end, it all went faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to resign, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild was supposed to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the main ZDF studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But it was also likely to have an impact on the fact that the director of the ZDF, Markus Schächter, would not be harmed further if this proposal were not approved by the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the time of writing.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the board of directors had already indicated weeks before the election, that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor had been organized by the president of the Hessian government, Mr Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious head of news with the argument, that under Brender's direction the ZDF newscasts would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flagellated the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law experts even intervened in the debate, calling Koch's action unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
Later he worked at the radio station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, initially to the news "heute-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and host of the morning programme "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy at the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The Green Party announced a constitutional lawsuit after Brender was removed from office, and he was chosen as the journalist of the year by the media magazine Medium Magazin.
Koch's opponent on the board, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way, that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of pro-ZDF political control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's removal.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the position of editor without losing face, and the board of directors could vote him out, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a partisan henchman.
In the party calculations Frey is awarded anyway to the left-wing liberals.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the federal ministers of education and culture finally relented.At a meeting of the ministers of education and culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in bachelor's and master's degree cases.
Students in the future should be able to outperform their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: basically each module of the course must end with a single examination.
The aim is to examine the workload of students and to ensure a 'real and justifiable measure'.
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities in and outside Germany.
The Länder commit to making the structural rules for Bachelor and Master courses more flexible together.
The regulations of the federal states which differ from this must no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of universities have continuously spoken about improving the ability to successfully complete a career (studiability).
Now for the first time a specific content was discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
The 'significant reduction in the burden of examinations' is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the study capacity, explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future 'studyable' must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions on students' choice of subjects.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative".
These rules would apply to new careers, but also to the examination of existing careers.
These must be "re-accredited" again every five years, but this would mean it would take until 2015 to examine all the careers.
The responsibility for this would lie with 10 accreditation agencies throughout the country, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federal states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some Länder universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured that additional means are provided for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination and foreign offices.
The Federal State and the universities intend to allocate 10 million euros for this purpose.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel university law.
According to her, one exam should be enough to complete a career model.
The degree structure should be made more flexible, and the recognition of assessments at other universities should be ensured and the Master's degree made more accessible.
Until the end of next year, all the courses are supposed to be examined for their "studability".
On Thursday, the government and opposition discussed again the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism about the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso (Young Socialist) University groups argued that the formation of education policy should no longer be done "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as the main stakeholders should be able to have their say too.
The president of the university rectors' board (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union demanded a legal right for every student with a Bachelor's degree to access a subsequent Master's degree.
The Länder must also ensure that there are enough places for the current generation of Bachelor's students in the future for the Master's degree with the best possible study conditions, as reported by GEW member Andreas Keller.
The Länder have to hire a lot more teachers.
But on greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done practically uncontrolled", says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced linguistic fragments, in which he discusses the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who gained his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable poetry lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian literature forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave a lot of talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In 1989, together with some of those present, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the Securitate's attempts to provoke fear", Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary polemic with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that shows the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far as we know, not only the perpetrator but also the victim.
In his Securitate dossier IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all the hard points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral imperative to make this statement", he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for Securitate-Spitzel gewesen spies, Herta Müller wrote in the weekly Zeit in July, after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved must have speculated and in some cases knew what names were hidden behind the aliases of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the controlled procedure for the review of Stasi files in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still rather vague.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and made difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clearance of Securitate files (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files has since been rather piecemeal.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large.
"She's psychotic", in the end they only questioned her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without a loop in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are silent accusations.
The calm reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the thirst for knowledge than by the adjudication of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart football team VfB, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed foreign service was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sporting goods manufacturer had handed out samples.
The characteristically bald man had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Besides, he could have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol involved, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or start over.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the quarter-finals", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation".
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the new rules are implemented.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing
The Champions League round of 16/17 and 23/24 February/round of 9/10 and 16/17 March will be played on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of Babbel's successor's thunderous entry was kept limited.
Not only in the supposed savior, who had in a short time inspired the bewildered Stuttgart pros with confidence, willingness to give and a taste for the game.
I went to the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more throwing, soul repairman Gross explained his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He played a certain magic, he accepted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, when in football a new impulse arises, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly moved on to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "cool wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation".
And this is what was obviously missing when Babbel was around.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more than anything else, consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a defence weakened by lack of reliefs and totally overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad wake-up call, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal for the season had been reached, the other was still far away.
We haven't gotten over the problem yet.
Heldt's reluctance to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were again brought up to date in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, given by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had blamed weak leadership on the board, which had decided to change coach under pressure from teenage fans.
Also that he had been eliminated from his day off after the games Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were marked by pure selfishness", Heldt said, and announced consequences for the defender.
They're probably not gonna be friends forever, the two 40-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the prior efforts with the replacement coach's team, the show of great play and battle strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had an important share in the success", Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World heavyweight championship fight
Fiery duel in Bern: time and again challenger Kevin Johnson was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges were unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight champion of the world.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat the American Kevin Johnson in the night of Friday to Saturday in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two-time world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout everyone had been waiting for could not be achieved.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Arena in Bern, Klitschko, standing 2.02 metres tall, wanted to dictate the fight mostly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters shorter, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the world champion's blows again and again, so Klitschko could not decisively take his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, to last twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already caused some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
When weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose so he could see his eyes".
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight since his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained undefeated.
After a break of almost four years, he beat then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his title defense, and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one hit, and I'm in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring all four major titles into his family.
His brother Vladimir is a World Champion in the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November the 2.13-metre-tall Nikolai Valujev.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company promoting it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, London.
The Kunduz case
Opposition frontal attack: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin  Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of knowingly deceiving.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on ARD television, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly did not tell the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In a case like this, it's usually said: he told lies.
The killing order would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Security Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was revealed that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, SPD and Left urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately to the German parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy and whether the Foreign Ministry, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Green colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The Foreign Office exercised no influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry's presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both had correctly and completely informed Gutenberg about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it transpired from the environment of the two senior officials that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert reportedly asked in a letter for clarification, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung.
So far no response, he said.
The ministry did not comment on Saturday on the allegations, saying they would be clarified by the Federal Parliament's investigation committee, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamy worlds
In the waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill and drug addicts who blur the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during wakefulness, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered a madman or a drug addict, or at least a maniac, in the modern Western world.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in drug addicts.
The fault lies with our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the lines between sleep, madness, and reality.
Dream-modified states of alertness can appear in a variety of forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to as visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts are very common.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of sleep in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, sleep was even "a psychosis, with all its nonsense, crazy formations, and mirages".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of wings, blood-red faces, deformed, gnashing their teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Shrill, evil voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can't take it anymore, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and fixes them to a hook in the ceiling.
You climb on a horn and tie the knot around your neck.
Jump in there.
The rope is loose.
"Let it be a lesson to you!" shout the voices in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get cured!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis episodes, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, taking medication, antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population falls ill with schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common illness after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most often the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside world, and they fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The sufferer is no longer able to distinguish between what is important and what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
It's generally not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle unchanged".
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are grounded in reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it's still a mystery why our brains go wild.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can cause anyone to lose contact with reality temporarily.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that there are other determining factors besides genes.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it is still a mystery how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role  stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers for a psychosis when a predisposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis by interfering with the brain's transmitter system.
When the brain gets hot
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether or not you perceive a hallucination as pleasant often depends on your point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, alongside mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and head and brain injuries.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or under-contained; when our brains get hot, but also when we lack stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also restriction of stimuli, stress, love sickness or other exceptional brain states.
In younger studies, up to one third of the respondents have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
A common girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes during recess, a clumsy boy with long, dark hair addresses him.
When she answers, the other students look at her in surprise; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and she hears that boy, just like she sees and she hears the girl sitting on the bench next to her.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he's in class sometimes he can't follow the lesson because the teacher  to his eyes and ears  is introducing a new classmate, while to the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep, which often comes late and is scarce, she cannot tell whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs, appear before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he shouts at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents or friends anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Since you've been in contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, you know you're not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will begin to hallucinate.
I think the brain is busy and is looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at age 13, she learned that the man she has called Dad since she has the use of reason is not her biological father.
Because visual and auditory hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, sufferers like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience", Kasten says, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images produced by the brain, which is why they seem so real".
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients regard their hallucinations as a special ability.
Borderline between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but one that also involves something positive and creative. Madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated what is called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost complex and detailed dreams that the person experiencing them considers real and that later cannot be distinguished from being awake.
Dream states of consciousness arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, he replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of his own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an intolerable situation in itself that our own creative capacity allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of soul saving.
He was 49 years old when his conscience set him on a multi-day journey following a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in a world he had created and visited strange places from other times: he found himself lying in bed, an elderly man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
He found himself in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the firn Alps and ran into a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Each change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
The sons will take over the publishing house at 27
The new publisher Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg  Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precaution.
The next question is whether they will be actively involved in the enterprise.
Also, if they're qualified to do so.
You can't put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they're not qualified enough.
That would destroy the kids and the company.
Mr Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down as chairman of the board of directors in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen had been appointed as his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
I was tech-in charge at the beginning.
Later, he was in charge of the treasury and with it the responsibility for the company's assets.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, and her son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said family businesses are not immune from decline: "It has always affected families who are caught up in the drive for capital, who have made a bad judgment and thought they could rise as high as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of grandeur", Burda claims.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play Time in the world league either; those businesses have gotten too big.
Integrated beauty
Everything - in terms of beauty and well-being - you could wish for, within reach.
This seems to be the intention of El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser hair removal -; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a session of jacuzzi, massages and drinking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities Spaxion offers.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' who guide the steps of the customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal password into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to do our exercise table correctly.
His supervisor says that 15 minutes (including warm-ups and stretches) is enough to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And if, after exercising our body, we want to go to the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Varied scutes
Christmas is coming up and it never hurts to go over the star looks to fit into our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important for enhancing the figure, is one of the variables we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose a very complicated and exaggerated neckline.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the 'Oficina LIVE'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, and gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to drive forward what the transport of the future will be.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities linked to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting electric vehicles.
The company participates in European standardisation groups and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main exporting sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has launched throughout the year to support the automobile sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a scenario of abandonment, of closure of some of our main productive plants", the government president said.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector", he added.
In this respect, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than 3.000 million euros.
The head of the Executive explained that this investment was committed to both the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show, a meeting place for professionals and motoring enthusiasts, will be held in Madrid.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of items related to the world of the motor.
The exhibitors will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of classic motoring that will delight collectors and curious.
The participating companies will include, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, catering; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and catering; or Cochera Clásicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Testing of skills abroad
In addition, the trade activity of this exhibition will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of conventions, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be conducted on a track outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness and performance
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated the Mazda3 the stop and start system of the engine -baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the vehicle finish, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects stand out in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, we see that the front seats are ergonomically excellent and have excellent grip.
The feel of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Following the set consisting of the dashboard, instrument panel and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with lots of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style is partly reminiscent of the one that the Honda Civic also features.
We can therefore say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car features more than enough seating for four adults to travel in a high level of comfort.
In addition, there is a large, regularly shaped trunk.
The automatic engine stop-start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-litre petrol engine and 150 hp and with six-speed manual gearbox.
This engine is a real delight, distinguished by its finesse, low noise, performance and low fuel consumption.
And although the most popular Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not discard this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort, and for its consumption contained.
The test was carried out on the Sporting version, which incorporates a larger number of standard components.
The standard equipment includes the lane changing assistant (RVM) which eliminates blind spots, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, although its equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
The Commission has
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its class.
It is particularly noted for the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150 horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
In return for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
The first luxury

The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, with no possibility even of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the web.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, I admit, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Seeing the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee of around EUR 12 per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and should have been in place a long time ago.
Yes, some carriers have special deals and travel plans, but in my experience, you need a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated efforts to achieve affordable roaming charges for all of Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the home country, there is fear of using data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (which is curious to have the name Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of tariffs means that operators are starting to think differently and study different proposals to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no pipes.
It's a connected device, and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that's what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I'll check my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite shade of the first lady of the United States.
If you have already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen it to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the reception in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - yellowish green with bright reflections - both times the outfit was made up of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the costume.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a thick lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with pattern.
The accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And the hairstyle is also different: a picked up this time, loose hair the previous.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women in the younger generations who want to become mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fertility and the working life of women in Spain', produced by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their employment opportunities limited because of motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the start of cohabitation and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
Women who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time or have a precarious job, start living together earlier, have earlier first childbearing and more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting a life together, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time in their life to get them, which has led them to postpone union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a great influence on maternity, although less on the calendar of mating", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have their first child.
The higher the education level, the higher the age at which they marry and have their first child, the survey found.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with primary and higher education have become mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age respectively on average.
"Another division is also made between women according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child", Delgado details.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its coveted list of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of the brand's various products, singing the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The star of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris signings, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony, which was held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing from the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives away in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have passed through his literary life (and, in some cases, also through the other).
He does not do so in the predictable and fearsome genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vincent is not without scares and lighting.
In addition to being a delightful treat, the book is a moving invitation to read and reread.
Here are some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, impulse, the same one I felt without a name: pleasure against miserable fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him".
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjoined the thrill of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition".
About James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed over the north wall, from which the best climbers are repeatedly climbed".
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange fellow.
Of himself, he sometimes said he was the heir of a county landlord and sometimes he said he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane scream thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to carry its echo to the depths of the 20th century night in its literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms".
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.'"
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these lines of Spenser: 'Sleep after toil, / after storm the harbour, / rest after war, / after life full pleases death".
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
Her husband would normally accept her telling him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never has there been a case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of her madness".
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame to serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is in her 70's, was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed her and our dog, a half-breed rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilograms, and without a word, they kicked her twice, leaving the dog badly injured.
We are outraged because we did not find any fun in a gratuitous attack on a small and defenseless animal, which was, by the way, tied up.
To this must be added the hot flash that caused a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she believed these individuals, became afraid for their physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same with a woman, a child, an elderly person or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt will do much and not to generate susceptibilities, just to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
We are outraged by this and have denounced it.
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find it amusing to mistreat a helpless animal for nothing that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Festival together for helmet use
The manufacturer of tires Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said the campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever safer products" and said it also contributes to this goal through other educational and information actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is 'a constant concern' for the company, since as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheelers, one of its main aims is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sales of light commercials up
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6% increase over 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers' association of manufacturers Anfac and the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not a bad thing, should be quarantined as the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008- was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
The result is that, despite the upturn in the last month, the number of enrolments accumulated in these 11 months is 40% lower than in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, including all light commercial vehicles: passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
The clouds that affect demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
The restrictions imposed by the tight tap on bank credit must therefore be supplemented by other factors such as rising unemployment or the continuing economic downturn.
In this context, and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
The Commission has also proposed a new directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they were again reminding the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial ones (trucks and buses).
The association of sellers forecasts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As happened with ABS anti-lock braking and will happen with ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a grace period is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian protection but, by its way of working, can also help to avoid many collisions within reach.
The emergency brake assistant increases the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's footstep.
But this one doesn't always keep that pressure up to the end.
According to a study by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not even hit the brake before the collision and half of them did not use all their force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 fatal pedestrian accidents could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device applies maximum force to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors is delaying the Opel plan until January.
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - the 8th probably - as Javier Ortega reports, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is for every point of the plan to be agreed upon in advance by the parties concerned.
And this may cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories to be delayed until early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but is gaining the upper hand over the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China's Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their ultimate, expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a basis and made it slim down to no less than 80 kilograms, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to do without, first, the automatic roof that has been supplied by a canvas one with manual operation, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' others 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, gained 7 kilos more; mounting sports bacquets another 12 and with the light wheels of 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought in another six kilograms and replacing the door handles with cloth ones, the remaining kilogram.
Although also offered with the dual clutch PDK gearbox, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox unit, primarily on California side roads, on mountain sections with really reversed tracks
His behavior can only be described as impeccable.
Reduced weight does not mean that the car does not tread the asphalt with serenity.
On the contrary, we had not tested a model so small and light that it could also transmit such safety in curves, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short run for as long as necessary, until we order him to sprint, to brake, to recover and re-squeeze his engine...
Thanks to your direction, as communicative as it is precise, what you indicate with your hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And he will do so with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of its 320 horsepower V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine bram, already released previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capability is brutal, whether from a standstill or in recoveries.
The suspension is firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drove the Boxster Spyder through was pretty bruised, but the car digested the potholes well.
The electronic aids barely made an appearance throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already early in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that you can have on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl' is a song.
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlette of the Maison's runway shows, the singer lavishes her face of a slut with as much contumacy as her Chanel handbags.
More like a Bad Girl or an It Girl, she's a Bag Girl.
Baskonia wins in Israel
Caja Laboral won 82-91 in their visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra pitch, despite the numerous losses of Dusko Ivanovic's team, and thus placed in the lead of their group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triplets scored was the best of his team (29 of valuation).
The Victorian team was able to make up for the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although they had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triplets scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The game started off strong for the bluegranes, who were ahead of the pack from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already presaged that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with their hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inside play and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with a round of cheers and applause on the way home, to continue to extend their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less six' rating already presaged that this was not going to be the Brazilian's best night.
But the match, despite being on the way to the break, was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that in their court no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elijah' squeezing they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the 'yellow' turning the bright (50-49).
More inconvenience
Ivanovic's injured but not less dead needed to make a couple of accurate plays to catch their breath, and in those came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), which managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavés went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's side did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the match was already in hand and the victory was escaping Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting.
Unicaja lost to Olympiacos in Greece and ceded the lead of Euroleague Group B, in a match marked by losses of the cajistas, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and also by the rival entity, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, a fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set started to function showing their superiority within both zones, where the loss by injury of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were weighing on the cajistas.
Between the inside players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
A rebound impossible
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leadership wobble.
The Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the setbacks the Unicaja had to face with Cook's direction and his three-pointers, and Lewis's contribution, it left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it was squeezing and given its superiority in centimeters inside the zone it was unstoppable.
Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to come back from the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went out, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can find out what salary they deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the most classified real estate, employment and motoring ads in Spain.
The How Much Should You Earn? tool calculates users' salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they wish to work.
In the week since the application has been in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels badly remunerated", explained Trovit product manager Albert Ribera in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer earns 45,226 gross euros a year and a French one, 31,059, compared with the 24,000 a Spanish one receives.
Similarly, a driver is paid a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France, and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by employee, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya to leave
The Brazilian government has given Manuel Zelaya a deadline to stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted President shall leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the business manager at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date from the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, when his term ends, he must look for another destination".
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the government of Brazil", Zelaya declared via telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's refusal to accept the status of political asylum sought by the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation was the dominant force in the markets, uncertainty is once again re-emerging in the markets, which should not be surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where players make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly giving a liquidity-free bar at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are virtually over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its annual auction next week.
Investors are therefore questioning the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, though they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again, there is a flight to quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have been the safe haven of choice for investors, widening the gap between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened a further downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad enough to silence the moral hazard advocates who were once again trying to create a charge of conscience on world economic policy makers for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit crunch on job destruction, when what should have been done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, the Dubai affair is a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain power in the emirates and the Greek affair we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and for it to allow a euro area country to default on its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, following some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads widen like European corporate bonds we need not worry.
If European disparities decrease and ours continue to widen, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
When our leading indicators are forcing most research services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, to come back to the load with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not bode well for their warning.
Again, it looks like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "prudence, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the Congress of Deputies subcommittee in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is being discussed.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brush strokes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the investments required will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be directed at increasing capacity in generation, but at distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes and we will have to increase the power.
It is focusing on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 MW of new power is needed, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes the Sustainable Economy Law bill that the government has just approved is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of fighting climate change.
In its view, there is a 'clear long-term commitment' in this regard, despite the 'specific' measures, as the Iberdrola chairman called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should be started now as they take time to mature and a stable remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins handling from Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner for the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at the 10 European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, the economic terms of which have not been exceeded, has a duration of five years.
Ferrovial, the Castilla-La Mancha Regional Council and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation agreement yesterday to create the Innovation Centre for Intelligent Infrastructures.
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% is for Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It is fighting for its first motorway in concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The tunnel project is valued at A$1.7 billion (about $1.047 billion).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are his rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
The city wants it ready by the end of 2014.
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP) to bring the project forward, in a business plan overseen by Erns & Young, the Administration has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
The Commission is now waiting for the bids to be submitted in May, and the planned investment amounts to A$1.7 billion (EUR 1.047 billion).
The group, named Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish liza, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The ACCIONA team is being played by the Northern Direct consortium, with the participation of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium to be examined is the LBRJV, with capital from the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the Galician firm Razel, which specialises in civil engineering.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction and privatisation, but it is clearly difficult to enter unless you acquire a local construction firm.
This strategy has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief and Bilfinger, as well as Asian reference companies, and remains an open question for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has only recently achieved a position on that market through its 30% holding in Hochtief, which owns Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate those two areas and to take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of infrastructure construction and operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and named Northern Link, is designed to link the western Toowong Highway with the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map) along a 5 km tunnel.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the tender for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of the following year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide A$500 million (EUR308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers Hochtief business.
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit for Hochtief, which announced yesterday the obtaining of a government contract valued at 154 million.
The company in which ACS is participating will, through its local subsidiary Leighton, provide the infrastructure for the national broadband network with fibre optic cable.
This will provide 400,000 people with fast internet access and give the German woman work for 18 months.
The company has also handed over the construction project for the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia, which was still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The firm was awarded the contract just days after it took over the 130 million dollar extension of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria.
Alpine thus reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will be completed within 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's publicity.
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services to the Mrs Rushmore agency for the next two years for an amount of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. mess. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition called by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined 63 million for restricting competition
France Télécom has been fined 63 million euros by the French competition regulator for anti-competitive behaviour in its Caribbean regions.
According to the Commission, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the scope of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has in fact been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
App store
The French company's mobile phone subsidiary has also followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an online application store, with the aim of increasing non-voice revenues.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have brought in 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth clubs to have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it's also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
The competition has distributed EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this set up well standing.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have the most money pocketed for participation, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money billed for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both against Barça.
Spain is only the third country to have won the most money through the Champions League, despite having won more titles than any other (five, four by Italy, three by England and two by Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization headed by Michel Platini plans to bring in 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will allocate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were able to participate received $3.8 million just for being there, plus another $550,000 for each match they played.
The winners of the eight finalists will receive three million each, the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket $4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, versus $5.2 million for the runner-up.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Spanish authorities on the aid scheme.
Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, which are allocated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportionate value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main languages, with four places allocated.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allotted, 30% for second, 20% for third and 10% for fourth.
The other half will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday scratched the details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a 25% to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not oblige it to launch an open tender offer (OPA) for all the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share which would be paid out over 10 years and which would be repaid with interest for this 1% annual postponement
Yesterday Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer from Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives shareholders 15 days to express their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If this were to happen, the disbursement would reach 611,7 million when Sos's capital stock is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, SOS continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential buyout offers and judicial back and forth between his former managers, brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, he announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created post which will be directly responsible to the group chairman.
And it's not without controversy, as the company is still in the middle of a legal battle over the alleged diversion of more than $230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that in the course of the next few months the SOS will uncover new diversions of funds.
As for the Salazar credit, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorises the exclusion request from Paternina submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Commission of the Value Market (CNMV) authorized yesterday the exclusion op presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body explained that it authorised the operation on the understanding that its terms were in line with the rules in force and considered the content of the explanatory brochure submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December to be "sufficient".
The CNMV has specified that the offer is for the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7,65 euros per share, which represents 8,95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He also explained that 5.592.778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the offer is completed, and that the price has been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for car testing
In these days of storms and accidents, it's not just the auto shops that win.
Every day thousands of cars that have been involved in an accident are towed to a repair shop, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000, including parts and labour, can take two to three hours.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information it provides.
That's why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
The service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then to produce it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the North American Solera group, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made on its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation tools and the production of information on the sector are GT-Motive and Eurotax.
Working with manufacturers' data is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's commercial director, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the volume of data to be processed is constantly increasing, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engine variants have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, each model is made a "smart" graphic image where you can "pinch" different parts of tourism.
If it's a model of a fan, the work can be done in a week if the process goes really fast.
If you are a minority car, it may take three or four months.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information on Porsche, but not on Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the number of vehicles in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the compilation of the databases, Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialised in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are added every month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to use it for different purposes and to offer a variety of products.
The most frequent use is in repair and maintenance, but depending on which country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that tells you about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
The products offered by Audatex give an idea of the support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims valuation solution for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it includes manufacturer estimated repair times or paint scales.
This tool is paid for by usage, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5,75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of assessments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line by its frame number alone.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lunes, and AudaAubastas is an online service open to the professional sector that allows bidding for vehicles declared to be totally sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or learning about deviations by model mark.
For example, it can be studied how many models of a particular brand have been broken down in the workshop or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, amongst others, Gt Estimate, which is also aimed at experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of the car
The Gt Appraisal Guide is your historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at an annual rate of 20% over the past three years, and in 2008 they generated a turnover of EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they started their internationalisation process, with the setting up of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, an increase of 3.3% on 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19,1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth on the Stock Exchange $1,000 million, and now its shares are quoted for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed cars
In October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for selling cars, motorcycles and special vehicles that have been damaged.
The transaction involved a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased to the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sale service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
The platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 transactions across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
The Spanish market is managed with 3000 ads per day and about 100 new ads are added every day.
Under Spanish law, a car with a badge number can't be put back in service, but some parts that aren't damaged can be used as replacements.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been registered after a lot of work.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the replacement, create a quote and generate a quote.
The ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who are usually more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question is displayed and the replacement required is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Now, the company Audatex is working on making these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very keen to see, because it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it over to see the inside.
