This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely held, but details the fossils generally cannot convey such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the cartilage of this animal was topped with a yellow or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of the wing in birds.
Since dinosaurs do not have a well-developed soft wing due to their heads, called rachis, but have other features of the wing - barbs and barbels - researchers have speculated that rachis may have been a later evolutionary development of other features like humans.
The wing structure suggests they were used not in flight but for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and not a female.
The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and not a female.
A suicide bombing at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey on Monday morning killed two police officers and injured more than a dozen.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters line up in a booth, laying out a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating their candidate of choice on it.
After the voter's identity is verified by the officer, the voter leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope was present at the start of voting and no envelopes have been added other than the ones duly counted and authorized by the voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process. In the evenings, votes are counted by heavily supervised volunteers, following specific procedure.

The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed, while the then-service boys had fired the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeboye has since been charged with the murder of his tourist at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but no eyewitness evidence can be penalised as her image has been widely published.
In Britain this is the usual practice but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have looked at the publication of the photographs as potentially exaggerating.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee notes that "journalists are walking a dangerous line in publishing photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in full charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until indictment.
According to Leek, the document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the first borders since the mid-1967 war.
Other topics covered include the alleged future status of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel seeks a continuing military presence in the valley despite having once agreed to sign an agreement.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, in partnership with the NPW and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NWA SW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Fallin, acting director of the Legacy with Parks Protection and NPW, the four shooters deployed for the first shooting operation received extensive security and training instruction.
A new Last Electoral Council (LEC) of nine members was sworn in yesterday.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a supervisory commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country to new election organs.
The Commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some as recently as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported to be overheated, causing a total of six people to catch fire and leaving four with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, Matty announced that Apple had notified him of 34 additional hyperthermic events, calling the company "non-negligent".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (at 09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office of Northern Marianas Emergency Management said there was no damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that the Kondo was not a tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman has held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza pulled his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several of the hostages have survived and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six of the hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographer replaced a doll because she had to go to the toilet; the Mendoza was later discontinued.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature labor during her spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
As Tommy Dreamer said, &quot;Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away two months after the Chariot of the Moons.
Dustin Goldstern commented that Runel "was as strange as me ... probably more so ... to love and remember him ... hopefully he's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Care Prime Minister Julie Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Of the extremists surveyed, 29 percent believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should not become a republic at all.
She won Olympic gold medals in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and was due to swim in the triple relay at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness has been in doubt due to her complaints.
They have been unable to take the medications they need to relieve their pain because they have been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets could possibly be the source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter that could create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth is formed, since comets collide with the Earth much earlier.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage the previous month.
He referred to the rumours as &quot;political flattery and stupidity&quot;.
He is projected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly smaller routes and save millions of gallons of fuel and cut carbon emissions every year.
This contrasts with the use of satellite-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is carried out and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parking and park-and-ride facilities on the land.
Fears of transport shortages increased the likelihood that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without supporters of the team.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos archipelago.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process took much longer due to cross-breeding between a localised Darwin's finch, Geospira fortress, and an immigrant cactus, Finch, Geospira conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wires, which can be twisted and pleated. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin, and stuck to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can make an indicator using the juice of red clover.
The juice of the gourd changes color depending on whether it is chemical of acidic or alkaline (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Wrap the dry powder together and then, with clean hands, squeeze it into a ball.
The tissue would react with the moist outer layers on the hands, which would feel moisturized and would become a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes a part of the public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you're calling someone who's a thousand miles away, you use satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then returns it almost immediately.
The satellites were sent into space by a rocket; scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and sights we see.
It takes a huge rocket 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways.The biggest thing about the wheel for us is that it gives us much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other transportation tools.
Below that are more medium-sized beasts that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small animals (including the loose pet cat) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special job each cat holds that prevents it from competing with others.
The servers are the most social of the beings, in larger groups called guides.
An applause consists of three related adult males, as well as thirty females and cubs.
Many of the women and girls have loyal attachments to each other within being a single female extended family.
Prairie lions act much like pack animals or dogs, bearing surprisingly similar traits to lions (but other larger felines), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, tigers can climb (though not perfectly), leap enormous distances and pull up to five times the strength of a stronger human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panarinia) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not the same as the lion's full-voiced roar, but like the cockroach's, the words are similarly shouted.
Ocelots (a medium-sized wild cat) prefer small animals to food; if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals that are preyed upon by an ocelot are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe the occlots followed and sniffed out the animals to smell (hunt) for food, where they landed.
They can see very well in the dark with sharp vision, and can also move very stealthily. Ossalotes prey on their prey by mixing with their prey, then eviscerate their prey.
When a small group (a small population) of surviving genera diverges from the main population (such as if they migrate to a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily migrate back) they will often find themselves in a different environment from what they were before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will require different features or adaptations to be stronger competitors than the one before.
The native population has not changed at all, even requiring the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and our farms from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurs were the preeminent hunters of their time, so they were not terrifying to anyone except the other mosasaurs.
The long jaw skins were carved with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth with an additional set in the mouth locks, meaning that their jaws had no corners for anything to cross.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included salmon, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It would have killed anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to compete for it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had artificial or unusual feast objects called wild boars, apes, snails, and a type of rodent called a rodent.
Another difference was that while poor men and women sat in chairs eating their meals, rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine may not have included the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and what the ancient Romans ate never tasted like a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered the house of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was the special sanctuary for the deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family had been in open aridity.
Women cooked in the yard; stores were open counters as seen in the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so logging was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, Greenland was found and named Greenland.
But despite their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true; although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The last word written on the Declaration of Independence was &quot;Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776&quot;. The text appears upside down, below the document.
While Kon Kon-ho does not write it down, it is known that in his lifetime, large parchment documents (this one 241‚ÅÑ2 inches by 2 93‚ÅÑ4 inches) were rolled up for storage.
So, it is likely that the notation was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated France in the north, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion into southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within only two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was in retreat.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who co-operate and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, from Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civis, meaning city or city-state, and it also defines the shape of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the passing of knowledge across many generations, a cultural footprint and an impartial dissemination.
Early cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government - with Congress being the only constituent under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since the Congress had no national executive or judiciary, it was dependent on state officials, who were often incompetent to enforce all its acts.
It had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
Amending the articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states petitioned the central government so much that its representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Seasonal sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international sports and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/cluster of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to as the &quotInsularity" in geographical terms.
The introduction of Taiwan was in the 15th century, where European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning the transformation of tribal grain production practices and employing Chinese labor to work their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces seized control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings were reconstructed on the sides of the complex to give tourists an idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size until the close of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is in fact, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Hence the aspect ratio of this format (when divided by twelve to get the simplest integer-ratio) is called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly approximate this aspect ratio.
The much-propagated and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamics by measuring the arrangement of the elements in an image.
It states that the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see examples).
The scope of such European history explores the period, in the middle of which, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful.
Christianity had held European states together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
Sublime power influenced the common people from the king.
One of the main Christian tenets is that money should be used to alleviate poverty and suffering and that the church's monetary wealth is to be used exclusively for good causes.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money forced many to question whether these principles would be fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The tactic proved effective, cutting off significant military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by the many international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire stretch of sea, which also endangered neutral shipping.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany had expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing views of most citizens and nations were pacifism and separatism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations expressed a desire to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the US for a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Bacheler (his manager at his previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods; each phase or family in China that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Alongside this was a volatile era of provinces divided between each dynasty.The period most famously known as the Three Kingdoms period lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between several nobles vying for the throne.
It was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of China, with thousands killed for the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi'an.
There were a number of social and political influences such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to any individual ruler.
Besides this, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious to become the most successful.
For this same army, therefore, the rank of an army was now based on its caliber rather than on its class.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions as well.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequently went to meditate in a cave known as the "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light).
The caves themselves, which had survived the age, give a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on a prominent peak from the mountains north of Mecca, the caves are completely different from the rest of the world.
In fact, finding it is not simple, even if one knows it exists. Once inside a cave, it is a complete isolation.
Above, the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains are nothing to see, with very little of this world to be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley, contains several pyramids (the largest of the Gnomes is the Great Pyramid), many smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The pyramid was built in honor of the great Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upper arrow sign looks like a V and the "lower arrow sign" looks like a staple or a square with the downward disappearing side.
Up means you should start from your tip and push the bow, and down means you should start from the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow typically produces a single soft sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more vocal.
Feel free to apply the pencil to your own marks, but remember that the printed flew marks are for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young children (Marie-Th√©r√®se, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob on 6 October 1789 after being chased by the market women.
In a carriage, she returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting against her king and queen.
The crowd forced each king and queen to leave the carriage windows open.
At one point a member of the crowd shook the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles in front of a horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the Philippine conquest were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
His American colonial regime was forced to pay taxes so that through his Wall Street banking houses he could pay a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government.
Undoubtedly, the super-profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the core benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that inspired the creation of the Order.
The age at which the events occurred, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD), is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending about 1500 CE by convention.
From technology advancing or technological imperative meaning primarily that human destiny is learning from the logic and their expression in technology, implied by scientific laws.Technical determinism is a term that encompasses a large range of considerations in practice.
Most explanations of technological transition share two general ideas: that the evolution of technology follows a path away from its actual cultural or political impact, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on underlying societies, rather than socially conditioning technology.
One could say for example that the motor car necessarily goes part of the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network would not only help cars to some extent economically, but also develop new methods of production to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Road accidents are increasingly being caused by car owners, in large part, which has led to the invention of new techniques in health care for the teething crowd.
Sancionism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from such writers as Goethe, Fitch, and Schlegel.
In terms of Sanctitarianism, geography molded the individual, and over time those customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these, being adapted to the location of society, were superior to arbitrary imposed laws.
Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, similarly to how Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world.
Its fame lasted until about 1100 AD and its popularity began in 400 AD due to its comfort.
The situation deteriorated during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices that were more expensive than they had been in Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that the title of the fashion capital was changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind those in the West.
Western Europe began to develop its own style in the late Middle Ages.One of the biggest events of the time was the resulting of the Crusades, in which people began using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is carried on only to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system that uses seed saved for ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel disconnected from social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be specific because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The traits that uniquely define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, including fashions, mannerisms, and logic.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is drawing some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while they were growing up through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse.
Such children are called &quot;savages&quot; or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases these children were abandoned by parents because of the child's severe intellectual or physical infirmity.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or separated.
Others are accused of having raised animals, while some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When brought up by completely non-human animals, wild child behavior (within physical limits) exhibited almost exclusively the special care-animal behaviors, such as fear of humans or apathy.
While the project-based learning should be made easier and more interesting to learn, the scaffold goes one step further.
Scalping is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a learner is a form of a scaffold but so is the small paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are there to question, indicate, and explain processes that a student alone might find challenging to handle.
This can be used to demonstrate and practice problem solving in front of the entire class in mathematics.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety net for these children.
Foster care is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home that they previously cared for.
The parenting care they receive is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home they first made.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal communication and goods.
The features of the Internet take on additional dimensions in terms of usage and experiential approaches.
"Learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use, for example (James et al. 1995).
"Individual participation" and "constant connection" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eghemi and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses on websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether or not someone is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper The President's Speech that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to correctly assess sincerity.
They also suggested that such abilities in explaining human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Isolation and recombination alter the differences between the two pools with each generation.
Outside of the savanna, plant resources available to digesting primates like humans are hard to meet their own amino-acid needs.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition and eventual death.
The most easily accessible plant resources are the proteins available in the leaves and fruits, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (such as chickens, ducks, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all these things, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep after a certain amount of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring oneself into consciousness without waking oneself up altogether.
If your child finds himself resetting the clock to sleep, the alarm can be placed on the other side of the room, allowing their alarm to go off and get out of bed.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the individual to urinate.
A person's degree of inner peace is inversely related to the degree of stress on his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force will be. Every person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism in principle is very simple; it includes the path of Kundalini yoga, meditation and universal love.
Staring at a point can effectively be the same problem if one stops seeing everything else in one's peripheral vision, or doesn't see enough motion.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of yoga, the purification of energy veins, the activation of chakras and the creation of enlightened consciousness through the philosophy of various deities.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, as was the collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war the country was expelled due to the clash of systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were no longer enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought, in real time, by pseudo-armies, on the battlefields of many places from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan, Cuba and many others.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken down, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup with the Romanian bridgeheads.
However, this made the plans almost overnight obsolete, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods, to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans, is by far the most efficient method.
The task of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their own country maintains the ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with their enemy's ability to move their own people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII.The Americans were attempting to transport men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using predominantly U-boats, was trying to stem this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have been able to conquer Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have first been domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep their milk, hair, meat and skin within easy access.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that moved around mountains or other grazing areas, often resembling the more widely known sheep herders, who often tended children or adolescents. These methods of rearing are still in use today.
In England, wagonways were created in the 16th century.
Although the wagonway only included parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to gain more speed and pull more weight than the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
Crosses were introduced long ago to hold the rails in place; gradually, however, it was realized that the track would be more efficient if there was an iron bar on top.
This became common, but the iron made the wagons' wooden wheels more stiff.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The earliest known transport was by foot, with humans beginning to walk upright about two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (i.e. upright man).
They did not walk upright like their predecessor, Australopithecus habitanus.
4.2-3.9 Ma, Australopithecus fossils are found to have bipedal specialization, although Sahelthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven Ma.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent to alleviate future suffering.
This is similar in many respects to symptomatic treatment.However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems, and we must inactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems caused by overpopulation and mankind's extraordinary lifestyles have become more and more acute.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 statues were made of the night, in what are now known as the "Dunlop Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. The other arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides still extant are the oldest surviving specimens of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that even today look like dinosaurs.
They have scales on their feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk like T-Rex on their two hind legs.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one value out of two, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - using computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are common enough not to be immediately diagnosed.
The best sign of internal toxicity may be an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bugs is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is already associated with the Dhakna, which is adapted to humans to make parasites.
Both assassin-bugs and bed-bugs are nocturnal creatures that have adapted to living in their domesticated guinea pig's burrows or in homes.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which leaves it as the dominant neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to get MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child to adopt a child.
Couples may choose to plan adoptions for their children.
In adoption, a birth parent terminates their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific research.
Although it is not alone, the experiment, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodicity, which is not merely a response to external periodic signals, has been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will keep the freewheeling cycling period going even in the absence of external cues.
One of the key suggestions of the Hershey and Cheese experiment was that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He conducted two experiments, marking phases with radioactive phosphorus on DNA or marking phases with radioactive sulfur on proteins.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected pieces of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germline cells or not.
Mutations in germ-line cells alone can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about ecosystems.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the organotungus in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave from small towns in cars to go to their peak workplace and drive past other people whose work destination is the place they have just left.
Each of these dynamic transportation shuttles is connected in some way, and supports transportation systems based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries we may also hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just incompetent? or was something else fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, the traffic flow has some reasonable consistency and so can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be carried on the air.The ability of insects to fly helped them to escape their predators more easily and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back with the body.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought this was true but many believed the opposite, that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and thus other stars).
Everyone seems to be thinking, why doesn't the Earth seem to be spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes at six miles wide.
About 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their appearance and the technical excellence of their construction.
The New Kingdom Old Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors that were a thousand years older than any time.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country and the least populous in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the working people in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are all naturally detectable and relatively simple with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a combination or amalgamation of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
He postulated that the four states of matter (in the same order) were like solid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they could be transformed into new matter and could not be altered.
A metallic alloy is essentially an alloy of two or more metals. The periodic table of the elements on this table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the period at the end of a sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good companion for many in the outdoors.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing appeared, the pencil declined in status and fell into disuse.
People now type messages on computer screens, never ever getting close to the sharpner.
One can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
Such as rolling a heavy cart down a hill. Redividing the nucleus frees up some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they are separated by very little or no cleavage.
The Moon's surface is made of rock dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The near side is about 70 km thick and the far side another 100 km thick.
It thins under maryland and thickens under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the side of the volcano because the crust is thin.
Content theory focuses on finding out what attracts people and why they appeal.
This theory suggests that some people have certain needs and desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories looked at what it is about some people that they want to be in a relationship that motivates them to do certain things and not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hartzberg's two factor theory.
Normally, two behaviors may emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues.People on one end of the spectrum tend to remain single (or tourists).
This type of manager has difficulty with unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performance appraisal, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a stranger is transformed into someone who feels that he or she should change everything that teams them up and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
These behaviors often result from a rift between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there is a subtle difference.
Members of virtual teams often serve as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have five letters more autonomy than traditional team members because they can meet according to different time zones which may not be understood by their management.
The presence of a good idealized team (Lorson and Lafasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The ideal team is the management team to which each member reports.
One of the goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation, which is why an organization must go through the feedback loop that takes place when a teaching organization is established.
When all available resources in the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and ingenuity can be communicated.
As a result, an organization's response works together to overcome a barrier that may be a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization is innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the Katyn approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition; this therefore narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
The links between neuropathology and behavior help scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, wounds, and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of technology allows us to see and examine new brain structures and processes we have never seen before.
It provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, machine learning and intelligent optimization.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that have the potential for intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customers and answer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate topics, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher will choose to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips.Students can sit together in their classrooms and view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, and admire fine art.
In fact sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on any trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are put online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally reverses this.
Since the student is often the most important audience, the blog author begins to make an effort to improve the writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them"; the need to feed the audience's interest "promotes students to be clever and interesting" (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "empower students to be more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet content, students can define their own position in terms of others' writing as well as outline their own perspective on particular issues" (O'Reilly, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is home to a series of art galleries and museums that display Canada's past and present.
To the far south is Niagara Falls and to the north is home to Muscocca and its further unspoiled natural beauty.
All of these things and Ontario are what highlight the best of Canadian by outsiders.
Larger areas further north are considerably sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited forest.
The population comparison comes as a surprise to some: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also ground Islam, and took control of large parts of the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Females: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring has also been helpful (not just the wedding ring which seems very expensive).
Women need to be made to feel that cultural differences can have consequences on how they perceive oppression, and that chasing, holding hands, etc. are not uncommon.
Don't be afraid to push men away, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (whether or not there are cultural differences doesn't justify it).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meranids as a strategic port named Anapa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan reconstructed the city as Dar el-Badiya and it was named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca remains one of the least interesting places to do shopping in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling the traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and the whole spectrum of gigabytes, around the old medina, but these are all open to tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east, near Rwanda.
Goma was devastated by the Angara of the Nerongo volcano in 2002, which cordoned off the city streets, especially the city walls.
While Goma is safe, one must travel outside Goma to explore the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu Province.
The city is the base for the climb to the Nyiragongo volcano, with the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
The usual (local) price for a short ride is ~500 Congolese francs.You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
With its relative inaccessibility, &quot;Timbuktu&quot; continued to be used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates's PBS special Wonders of the African World.
This city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab feel to it than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Alligator River to the south.
The park spans 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 separate ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the crown jewel in the South African National Parks (Sanparks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees for the park.
It can also be beneficial for someone to buy a wild card, which grants entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or any of the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the location that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a magnificent bar chart illustrated by the presence of Victoria Harbour over the water.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across to the Kowloon Waterfront.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is for the most part densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where British colonial minds were drawn and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this would be a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian Territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just the mangrove swamp, however - it contains some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forest that once covered the Ganges plains.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is water/swamp areas.
Since 1966 Sundarvan has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and some 30,000 cheetah deer in the area.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially buses heading East and Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most people in the district take the small Japanese coaster bus, which is comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places such as Paro (NU 150) and Punakha (NU 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two massive towers rise to a height of 83 metres, Ai is 378 metres tall and has two 3.50 metres wide lanes.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 m. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The Puli√° is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoints are expected to be eliminated.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicur and the Payaguan, who made their living by gathering game and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", came into being as a result of the encounters of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous indigenous groups.
The people of Spain began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, small tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For news of the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo match, see Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which has been pegged at one British Pound (GBP) equivalent value.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley, from the FIC West store.
The British pound is commonly accepted anywhere in the islands and credit cards and United States dollars are also frequently accepted within Stanley.
Credit cards are rarely accepted in the outer islands, although British and United States currency may be used; ask the owners in advance for acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside of the islands, which is why the islands must be exchanged for money before leaving.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is hot there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures above +30¬∞C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but winds and humidity tend to make it feel colder than the thermometer can tell.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same in almost every year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to park officials, bears and wolves should be kept at a distance of at least 100 yards/meter and all other wild animals 25 yards/meter!
No matter how tame they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a proper distance. These animals are large, feral and potentially dangerous, so let them stay in their place.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889 the harbour was the site of a notorious naval standoff when seven ships from Germany, America and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the freedom struggle organized by the Mouvement Mou, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasi Lilophe III.
The most popular are the three in the area.There are several beaches due to the inclination of the Auckland arm of the two harbours.
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbor District) are on the Pacific Ocean and border Long Bay to the north as far as Devonport in the south.
Almost all parts of those protected towers are sandy beaches, and the monument is shaded by trees of the Pohatuca.
Tamaki Drive Beach is Wetamatha Harbor in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Helier in central Auckland.
It sometimes becomes a crowded family beach, with shops lined up on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Other local beers are called 'Manta'.
There are French wines, but many New Zealand and Australian wines may be better travelled.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are scared.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is alien to Australians. There is a small black 'espresso', comes with cappuccino cream (without the foam), and is served tea without milk.
Hot chocolate is similar to standard Belgian. Fruit-flavored chocolate is expensive but excellent.
Many visits to the reef are made throughout the year, and it is rare for the reef to be injured from any of these causes.
However, officials must take counsel, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found along beaches and river mouths from October through April as far north as 1770.They can sometimes be found just outside these hours.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea; their primary habitat is in the estuary of the North River from Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives the traveler peace of mind that there will be arrangements for sleeping on his side after he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through the travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may defer your reservation for a while if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
However, any modifications or requests should first be made through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of concert-goers choose to camp on-site, and most hosts consider the experience a valuable part of the experience.
If you want to be close to that action, you have to go quickly to get a camping site closer to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music may have ended at the main stages, there may still be some parts of the celebration that are played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If crossing the northern Baltic on a winter day, check the cabin location, as there is a fairly awful noise from the passing snow which is very much affected to the mind.
Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make several attempts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to get out.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them on campus.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served, however, drinking interferes with judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining calm.
Those who ever go to drive in higher latitudes or mountains should consider the possibility of snow or freezing temperatures.
Snow and icy roads have less friction and you cannot drive like you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep you trapped.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or condensation in vehicle windows or snow.
In the afternoon, snow and ice conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the largest tourist attraction in Africa and attracts many visitors.
In popular usage the term safari refers to a trip underground to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to the eyes and the standard equipment allows a good view.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you'd better take a look at them through a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a &quot;busch walk&quot;, &quot;hiking safari&quot; or &quot;footing&quot;) is a long walk, either for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you were afraid to book your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-related cancellation policies did not extend until late March, when the Olympics were scheduled, and July 2020.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with specific tickets costing around ¬•7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help to dry them out.Iron and ironing board are available on loan at many hotels, even if there is no room.
If irons are not available, or if you don't like to wear ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the clothes get too warm (which can lead to shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are various ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home areas.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse yet cause allergies, spread toxins, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill humans, do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in some locations.
Travelers forced into countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through the isolated backwoods area.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be aware of yourself: steep grades, narrow streets and sharp bends are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are considerably lower than those in the earlier and later sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is very good and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor of the heart, Austria, is quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastry is common, apples are cooked in pastry all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the so-called Berliner, Pfankuchen or Kraffhen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With over 17,000 islands to China, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
Again, if used without further qualifier, the word basically means the food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine features a range of dishes commonly experienced in the Javanese cuisine, the major flavors being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The Lord is the support of the rider's feet, which hang on both poles of the staff.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can cause safety concerns due to the possibility of their legs getting caught in the rider's traps.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his legs are caught in the stirrup, they are in danger of being dragged off if the horse turns the running bar. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions are taken.
First, most riders wear a heel and a sleek, fairly narrow, shoe show.
Furthermore, some staves, notably the English cane, have safety strips that allow a rider's skin to fall off the cane if pulled back by the rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its huge walls and crags of various types of granite.
The summit contains breathtaking views from the peak. Climbers from all parts of the world continually establish new routes within its walls of endless potential.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", planning the whole vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!

Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to several countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls at times.
However, the Schengen Zone functions somewhat like a country itself in this respect.
As long as you are in these areas, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control.
Also, since there is a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, which saves time, money and paperwork.

The latter includes Livingston Island and Cheo where a still active volcanic flooded caldera gives a very lively natural harbour.
Ellsworth is the southernmost point of the Land Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's lower slope slopes into the plateau, then reemerges to form the 360 km chain of Ellsworth Peaks, two rifts of which were carved by the Minnesota Glacier.

Finland is a great place for a boat trip. There are also thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos in the Land of a Thousand Lakes.
Islands and lakes do not necessarily require a raft.
The coastal archipelago and largest of the lakes are in fact too large for any boat, while smaller boats or even a canoe give a distinct experience.
Sailing in a canoe is a national pastime in Finland, with a canoe for seven or eight people each.
This corresponds to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is much larger than unique (for example in the Netherlands this figure is forty one each).
