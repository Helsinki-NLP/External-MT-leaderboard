Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already been accepted, but it also provides details that fossils can usually provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feathers were warm-brown above with a pale carthonoid hue at the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur fins do not have a developed stalk, called a snout, but have other features of feathers - fins and scales - the researchers concluded that the snout was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult animal and not a feather of a chicken.
The researchers suggested that although it was a young dinosaur's tail, the sample showed a plumage of an adult rather than a chick's.

The amount of light and the rotation together determine the number of stars in the Rosby, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rosby number, the less active the planet is in terms of magnetic inversions.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made on the Sygitarius galaxy.
The impact the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravity on the Earth causing tides and subsidence, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sygitarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and it's made up of many tiny particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a simple technology experience: voters isolate themselves in a chamber and put a pre-printed sheet of paper on an envelope stating the candidate they are voting for.
Once the officials verify his identity, the voter then delivers the envelope to the ballot box and seals it on the ballot.
The electoral laws in France are quite strict about the procedures.
Since 1988, ballots have had to be transparent so that voters and bystanders can witness that there were no envelopes on the ballot prior to the start of voting and no envelopes added other than those of the legal and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to serve as witnesses at any stage of the process.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver from the red TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adcoia has since appeared in court in Edinburgh charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be damaged since her picture has been widely circulated.
It's common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts have seen the publication of images as something that could cause bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "It seems that journalists are indeed willing to take risks if they publish pictures of suspects and so on".
The legal department, which handles all prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made until at least a conviction is reached.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to base on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
It has been determined that the shooters in the additional pesticide experiment will be under close supervision of forestry officers, as the experiment is under surveillance and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
"In conjunction with the Parks and Wildlife Service and the New South Wales Sport Runners Association, "qualified volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sport Runners Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting administrator of the NPWS Heritage and Conservation Park, the four shooters selected for the first firing attempt were given comprehensive safety instructions and guidance.
Martley yesterday seventh a new nine-member CEP.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dismissal of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the large-scale protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the non-existence of elections, which were supposed to have taken place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, a problem that led to six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 more cases of further warming, which the company called ""not serious"."
The office responded by calling Apple's report delay "very regrettable".
The quake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau has reported no damage in the state.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been released and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then the cameramen took the place of an elderly lady who needed a bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to explore the topic of preterm birth in his spare time.
His study showed that taking a hormone would accelerate the fetal lung development of the baby.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two "black box" flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Loona was the first queen of the X-Men. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons.
Dustin "Goldast" Ronson said, "Loona was as freakish as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people surveyed in the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m, 200m freestyle and triple jump at the British Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness was called into question.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to get over his father's pain because it's forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime ever known on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various materials and software in early February and the announcement came out on Tuesday.
Comets could have been the source of water coming to Earth, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He's supposed to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
"It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology, to allow flight observers to more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information".
No additional transportation and trains will stop at Wembley, and parking and travel facilities are not available on site.
Fears of a lack of traffic raised the possibility that the game would have to be played in closed grounds without team fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although previously thought the process took much longer, due to the marriage of the endemic Darwin's cactus (Geospiza fortes) and the large migratory cactus (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
You can stretch it into a thin thread, which you can twist and fold, you can back it up or flatten it out.
"It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator from cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been abstracted from them (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet, clean hands, make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a sort of shell.
In Arapa and Manguidaro, there was a toilet with all the waste in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space takes the call and then transmits it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and mirrors.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much lighter and faster means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pets) that eat the smaller animals that are much larger in number, such as insects, reptiles, bats and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special role each cat plays that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in large groups called herds.
Groups consist of one to three adult male relatives, along with no less than 30 females and pups.
Females are usually close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and as such are especially lethal to their prey.
Being particularly athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group as the lions, tigers and jaguars.
The tiger's howling is not like the lion's powerful rattle, it's more like a sentence of words shouted in disgust.
Eucalyptus prefers to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles and birds. Almost all the animals that eucalyptus prey on are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that ocelots find prey and track it by scent, by the smell of the soil they pass through.
They can see well in the dark using night vision, and they can also sneak in the silence.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously required to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they won't be seen as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means creating new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans expel.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals can't survive.
The Moosaurus was the great predator of his time, so he wasn't afraid to speak, except for other Moosaurs.
Its long jaws were pierced by more than 70 sharp teeth like a spade, and an extra set in the upper part of its mouth, meaning that anyone in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a halftongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other molluscs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
In addition, it attacked any creature that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not stand up to it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have some strange or unusual items for celebration, including wild boar, cod, snails and a type of reptile called namamen.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have dinners where they would sit on their sides while they ate their meal.
It's impossible that ancient Roman dishes included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, a temple considered the house of the god.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and a sacred inner courtyard that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter that much.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were not many forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
In Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his western expeditions discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian,' there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the National Treasury movie, you might think a treasure map was painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, and vice versa.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his days, the large card document (measuring 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it's likely that the additional marker is just a label.
The landings on the day of the invasion of Normandy and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by Vichy's Frenchmen, who were Frenchmen who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and sided with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and moved toward Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by an especially large group of people who live and work together, as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word chibilis, which means citizen, related to the Latin word chibis, which means citizen, and chibitas, which means city or city-state, which also defines in some way the size of society.
Civilization implies the transfer of knowledge between several generations, a cultural footprint and a relatively large distribution.
Minority civilizations often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities in the states, which were often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
And it had no authority to circumvent the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The statute had to be unanimously agreed to by all the states before an amendment could be added, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.
"The Italian national football team, along with that of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion".
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan owns nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honsh≈´), making it the seventh-largest island in the world!
"Because of the archipelago of Japan, it is often defined as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view".
"The theory of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European travelers recorded the island's name as "Ilia Formosa", or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which caused a change in traditional grain-growing practices and the employment of Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1912-1644) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Agreement, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, which are the Intuitana, the Sun Temple, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, 30 percent of the Macho Pichu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
"For example, the world's most common still format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era".
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its height-to-width ratio has been inherited to the image formats of a digital camera.
The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
So the width-to-height ratio of this format (twelve parts to get the simplest integer ratio) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (from the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or close to this width-to-height ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has absorbed cycles of ridicule and abuse, is a simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the picture.
He states that the most effective place for the central subject of the photograph is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under severe criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the countries of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Its penetrating power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the central beliefs in Christianity is that capital should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money is specifically intended for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle had been preserved.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Britain laid a naval siege on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, and it blocked vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international rules that had been signed into a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain spread mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its borderless submarine fighter.
During the 1920s, the prevailing position of most citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horror and horrors of war in World War I, nations wanted to prevent the same situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to get a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of representing different time periods; each stage in Chinese history or each family that held power was a unique dynasty.
Also, there was an unstable era of divided provinces between the dynasties, known as the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
In those days, there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, going from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, professions were open to any man who wanted to, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is true of the military because instead of ranking the military based on rank, they were now based on ability.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many more of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this physical life. He often commanded a cave known as the 'Hira' on Mount 'Nur' (Light) to immerse himself in profound contemplation".
The cave itself, which has survived throughout history, provides a rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountain top north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all even if you know it exists.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful skies above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the "Great Pyramid" is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and the members of Khufu's family.
The "up arc" sign looks like a V and the "down arc" sign like a pin pin or square without its lower edge.
Up means you start at the end and push the bow, and down means you start at the end (in the place of the hand holding the bow) and pull the bow.
An upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while a lower bow is more powerful and assertive.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember that the notes are there for a musical purpose, so you should usually stick to them.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forcibly transported to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a man from the crowd waved at the head of the Royal Guard soldier who was killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism for the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds they had deposited in the name of the Philippine government through the banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the establishment of the Order.
The period in which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The height of the Middle Ages was preceded first by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Common Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from push technology or technological dictation to a hardened sense that human destiny is based on logic that rises above natural law and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development proceeds in a way that is largely unaffected culturally or politically, and that technology has ""impacts"" on societies that are constructed, rather than social conditioned".
For example, you could say that the car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed in order to lower the cost of owning cars.
The proliferation of private cars also increases the incidence of road accidents, leading to new healthcare techniques for repairing body injuries.
The Romantic movement contained a large element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Pietta and Stag.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures associated with this geography emerged, and these, due to their harmony with the place of society, were preferred over the rules imposed by the rituals.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of prestige began around 400 CE and continued until 1100 CE.
Its status declined during the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were more expensive than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was deeply influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, because of slow media, Western fashions may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to buy clothes.
Sustainable agriculture is farming designed to produce enough food to meet the exact needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, method that uses preserved seeds from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other methods that are relatively simple to maximize reproduction.
Throughout history, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar perceptions who feel left out by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The features that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture usually mark their membership using unique and symbolic use in a style that includes fashion, jargon and slang.
One of the most common ways to experience the importance of socialization is to learn from the unfortunate isolated cases of children who, because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, did not experience socialization by adults as they grew up.
"Some of the wild children were imprisoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child occurred due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some were said to live in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (under physical limitations) almost entirely identical to those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the bug method goes one step further.
Pygmalion is not a learning method but a learning aid that supports people going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Pygmies can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are a form of pygma but also a little paper clipper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual puzzles are embedded in the software and are designed to ask, respond to and explain challenging processes that students may have difficulty dealing with on their own.
Children are sent to foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they grow up that way.
We see the foster system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken in the past.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usability and access to content.
"For example, it has been argued that ""learning"" and ""community"" are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and Cord (1998) when they studied audience responses to Internet sites".
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, noted how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge honesty.
He even suggested that such abilities in analyzing human behavior are also shared by animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century studies have shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variety, and selection erases it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and re-combination blend the differences back and forth between the two deposits with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most available plant resources were the cheap, small available proteins, but it's hard for primates like us to digest them if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in about the same ways that chimpanzees use in the savannah today".
Sleep apnea is a process of deliberate waking during your normal sleep time and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
You can do that easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on urethritis involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known urine) before bed, forcing the former to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists.
The only thing that separates him from our goals is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but this is expanded by the love path of Mahayana and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the Kundalini of yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and imagination.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the divine being. Through visual thought of various divine beings, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
"Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. "As the war ended, conflicts of systems, procedures and cultures led to division between the countries".
Within two years of the war's end, the former Allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
"It took place over the next 40 years and actual combat was conducted by 'messenger' armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places".
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only chance was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way at great distances to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Marine Corps has traditionally been to ensure that your country can keep your people and products moving, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and products.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Early cultures and tribes began keeping them for convenient access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherd. These tracking methods are still in use today.
Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were only parallel wooden structures, they allowed the horses to pull them at higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Cross-linking was introduced early enough to hold the rails in place. However, it gradually became apparent that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became the norm, but the iron further rubbed the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railways made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of mobility was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often as they did.
Walking on two legs was found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, although the Shalenotropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists to reduce future suffering in some way.
In many cases, it's just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have intensified because of humanity's dense population and dispersed lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, now called "Dunlap sheets".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who called it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop sheets that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But a lot of things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with spines and tops, they lay eggs, and they walk on their backs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one or two values, i.e., 0 or 1, these numbers are referred to as binary numbers  or bits, according to the professional computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open medicine box or or open bottles of household chemicals.
You should check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with bed bugs, which are insects that have largely adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both torpedoes and bed bugs are nesting midges that have adapted to living in a nest or a host's house.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), so it's still the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to get a common thoracic kick.
Couples may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in their child's best interest, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to plan for their baby's adoption.
At adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides, in fact, most scientific research.
But it's not the only one - experiment, and an experiment is a test where you use it to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and perform observations as well as conduct scientific research.
"Naturists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible".
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior, which often depend critically on the presence of internal cycles, and their formation by biological clocks.
Cyclical patterns, which are not just responses to external periodic signs, are documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for a period of time in constant cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hersh and Chase experiment was one of the leading claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where we marked the DNA in Pages with radioactive resin or the Pages protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are offspring of the germ layer.
Only mutations in the germ lineage can pass to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is a visit, photography and study of orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their work and pass other people who will die where they just left.
In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive of a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems draw such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are simple transportation engineers untalented? Or is something more substantial going on there?
Traffic flow is the field of study that studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flow learning is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior tends to stay within the range of logical consistency; therefore, traffic flow usually has logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we've calculated relationships between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
That fact gives them a wider range of small places to hide like madmen.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the ferns and the rhinoceroses.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite was true; that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, flowing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows through Earth's tunnels into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
"The central Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers".
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, no other structure matched the Giza pyramids in size and construction excellence.
Ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican Library uses Italian in its legislation and in its official media.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, developed the theory that everything is made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter's assembly (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also argued that they were being turned into new materials to create what we see.
Alloy is simply a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table includes many elements.
Elements like silicon and aluminum are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
So, once it came into use, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil's status declined and its use declined.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near the controller.
I wonder what the keyboard will turn when something new comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart upwards, and the nuclear fallout again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms are unstable atoms, which means they tend to break down with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the core is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the dead and thicker under the dead.
There might be more moons on the near side because the membrane is thinner, so it was easier for her heart to come up to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding the same thing that motivates or charms people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they fulfill as they grow older.
These theories examine what is in certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors can break out when people become the managers of their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys".
This kind of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, doing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and demanding that people take responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are required to the same professional standards as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons with their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional staff members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understandable to their local management.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The "Invisible Team" is the management team that all team members are subordinate to. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each team member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the resources available in all the functional departments of an organization are used efficiently, creativity and resilience can emerge.
As a result, a process of the organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), explains the sequential approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have not been seen before.
This provides us with much of the information and material needed to build blood models, which help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves developing machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and time management, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
It is commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been installed in a number of home computer and computer game software.
Tours play a big role in every classroom. Often a teacher will be happy to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips, where students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or take in beautiful art while sitting next to their classmates.
Sharing a virtual tour together is also a great way to observe the trip and share future classes in the experiences.
For example, every year, students at the Bennett School in North Carolina build a website about their state capitol, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a memoir.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy syntax and spelling, audience presence often affects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also "motivated students to be more in the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that inspires and encourages students to continue learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs ""may empower students to be more analytical and critical; through active response to online materials, students can define their position in the context of others' writing, as well as form their point of view on certain issues (Oraver, 2002)".
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it has a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of the Moscow region and beyond.
All of these and more make Ontario what outsiders consider a typical Canadian city.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are barely populated wilderness areas.
"A comparison of populations that surprises many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens".
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and the continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as prestigious coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it gained a wide hold in the Comoros and Miut.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the discovery of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's captive route from Europe to India.
The area is bordered to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every traveler state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also advisable to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they would have perceived as harassment, and that it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, hold their arms, etc.
Be aggressive in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for each other (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!)
"The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Barbary fishermen in the tenth century BC, "and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marnids as a strategic port called Anpha".
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bayda and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old country it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items, like tajeens, pottery, leather goods, dresses, and a whole range of small items, but all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo far to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Guma was destroyed by the eruption of the volcano Niragongo, which covered most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be checked to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the volcano Nirungo, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a bud-bud (motorcycle taxi) to get around the ridge. The usual (local) price is about 500 CZK for a short trip.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a wealthy city, although thanks to its reputation it is still a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
"It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates PBS special "The Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African scent.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park stretches over 12,000 square miles and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there is a conservation fee and two days' admission to the park.
You might also want to get a Wild Card, which gives you access to a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place where Rabin tourists are considered as a major focus.
The row of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, exit the island and turn toward the Kaulon coastline on the left.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers saw their place, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial occupation of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest free-ranging mangrove belt in the world, extending from the coastline for 50 miles [80 km] into the inland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans Forest has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
"The Sundarbans forest extends over 3,850 square kilometers, of which about a third is covered by water areas or grass swamps".
Sunderbans Forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the Inter-Rivier Bus Station during the day, although most, especially those facing east and the Jacar/Bomtang depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-county buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travel to nearby destinations, such as Faro (150 Bhutan nagartrums) and Puneca (200 Bhutan nagartrums).
The Avep√∫ac River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Avep√∫ac River to connect the towns of Avep√∫ac in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Avep√∫ac in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two tracks three and a half meters wide.
The minimum height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, so Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco area was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuro and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, fishing and reclaiming.
"16th-century Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born from the meeting between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players who are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year was held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
You can also see smaller tournaments and games here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo games, search the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is defined as the value of one British pound (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound will be accepted on the way everywhere in the islands and within Stanley will often be accepted credit cards and American dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, although British and U.S. money may be accepted. Check with the owner in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's summer, in the northern hemisphere it's winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures often exceed 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the meter would suggest.
"There are no defined rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains constant throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a minimum distance of 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from any other wildlife!
No matter how comfortable they look, bison, Canadian elk, leopards, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep proper distance.
Also, it's good to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so don't carry on your body, cook spicy foods, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Opole with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour has been the site of a famous naval conflict since 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British patrol ship was sunk, and almost 200 Germans and Englishmen lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mao Movement, peaceful demonstrations in the city led to the assassination of Supreme Leader Topowa Tamasa Liallopi III.
There are many beaches, since Oakland is spread over two wharves. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (in North Harbor County) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all are shallow beaches safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by the pohutokawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in the Waitemata Bay, the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Liars in central Oakland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a great variety of shops along the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a complex beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The additional local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more travel-resistant.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but for those who are apprehensive, it's very easy to find bottled mineral water.
For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is unfamiliar. Short black is espresso, cappuccino comes with plenty of foam, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate on Belgian standard, expensive but delicious fruit juices.
Many ski trips are year-round, and injuries from one of these factors on a skiing trip are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubic jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April 1770 north of the equator. They can be found occasionally other than for these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace and security of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should first go through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay on site, and most attendees see this as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, you'll have to get in early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may be over, there may still be areas of the festival that continue to play music into the late hours of the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cell location, because crossing the ice makes a pretty terrible noise in the cells most exposed to it.
Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Typically, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in the mood and to make sure they don't leave the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages at the house, but rent is a judgment issue, and every good gambler knows the importance of keeping his head above water.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On snow and ice-cold roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you would on exposed asphalt.
In a snowstorm, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing in the wind, or by snow or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted year-round.
Safari trips are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the headline for many travelers.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland trips to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the sauna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for convenient viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and tigers are sometimes shy and you can see them better with glasses.
"A walking safari (also called a "busk walk", "bag safari", or "run") consists of a walking tour of several hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in trouble.
There are a variety of cancellation policies, but since late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not cover until July 2020, the date set for the Olympics.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, and most tickets will cost around ¬•7,000.
Many hotels have a dryer and a barber's table available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there's no hair dryer available, or if you don't mind grooming for hair socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if there is one around.
Be careful that the wound does not overheat (which can cause a contraction, or in extreme cases, a burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, it's enough to boil water for a minute, in others, it takes several minutes.
The efficiency of different filters is not constant, and if you have concerns, you might want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unknown to them from their areas of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Self-infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are usually not classified as harmful.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duty and tariffs in certain places.
Travelers arriving in high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section from Point Marion to Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Lower Pittsburgh Freeway, and often passes through arid and isolated land.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, beware: There are many steep stairs, narrow paths, and sharp turns along the way.
"Published speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual".
Strangely, cell phone reception is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, like the wilds of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, they're rich and varied, similar to those in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit muffins are common. Apple muffins can be found all year round while cherries and plums come in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, walnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes are usually especially suitable for a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what's called depending on the region a berliner, pancake or crab.
Curry is a dish made with spices and herbs, in addition to meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the mainland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curry preparations; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But, if used without further descriptions, the term refers to food originating in the central and eastern regions of the central island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of dishes spiced with simplicity, and the prominent flavors that Javanese love are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The supports the rider's legs, which hang from either side of the seat.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the saddle, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear biking boots with smooth heels and tight soles.
In addition, some of the arches, especially the English arches, have safety poles that allow the archer's skin to fall off the archer's shoulder if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly building new tracks within the endless potential of the walls.
Slope snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport based on sliding down a snow-covered surface using skates or snowboards attached to the legs.
"Skiing is a major hiking activity with many amateurs, sometimes called "ski-boarders", planning a complete holiday around skiing in a particular place".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting people skiing date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing, ski touring, or skiing trips.
It is related but not usually alpine-style or mountaineering-style skiing, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much harder boots and skis.
Think of a ski run as a nature walk.
Under good conditions you can cover greater distances than by walking - but very rarely will you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on trails trained for this.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries requires going through the visa application process and passport verification many times.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, acts a bit like a single country in this respect.

Similarly, when you have a singer's visa, you don't have to apply for a visa for each country singing separately, so it saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique. Some tax authorities define goods that are more than a hundred years old.

Wildlife survival books and magazines are common, but war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without an X-mark or documents that have been updated to fit the name and gender of the person is changing.
The difference in the willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is no less.
Security checkpoints have also become much more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people before surgery shouldn't expect to be able to pass through the scans without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Backflow is the return of the current from the breaking waves on the shore, often in reefs and so on.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue, due to trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once they're out of the stream, swimming back is not as difficult as usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or according to your skills and if we spot you, maybe you should wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to the culture they were born into.
When you return home after living in a foreign country, you've adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first arrived in a foreign country, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to new countries need to adjust.
People may not expect patience and understanding from travelers returning home.

The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago lies about 120 kilometres (75 mi) north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa las Astreas.
With the others are Livingstone Island, and Disappearance, where the flooded slopes of the still-active volcano still form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost part of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into the plain, then reappear to form the 300-mile-long Ellsworth Range, cut by a Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part or Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest of which rises to 4,892 m (14,932 ft).
In remote areas, without cell phone reception, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Usually a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you have to be out with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by vessels, including pleasure ships, as well as research missions that require remote data communication and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should provide you with more information about how to connect to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
It's especially popular with high school seniors, allowing them to take a year off before college, without compromising their education.

"Finland is a great sailing destination. In the Land of a Thousand Lakes there are also thousands of islands, lakes and archipelagos of the coast".
In the archipelago of islands and islets you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelagos of the largest beaches and lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
It's similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but beyond that it's unique (in the Netherlands, for example, it's 1 in 40).
Most special cruises in the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few full days and then go back to sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only come to the coast by boat trips, you won't need a separate visa (valid until 2009).
Some cruises indicate Berlin, Germany, in the balconies. As can be seen on the map, Upper Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

The only way to get through it faster was to send it as registered cargo.
The obvious way to fly in business or first class is to pay a large amount for the privilege (or better yet, have your workplace pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay for a business section up to four times the usual fare in the tourist section, and eleven times for the first section!
In general, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on flights direct from point A-B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at their destinations quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
