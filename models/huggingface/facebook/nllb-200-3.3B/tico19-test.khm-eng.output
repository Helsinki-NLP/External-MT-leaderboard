Rapid increase in coronavirus (COVID-19) infection events in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The rise in cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) is showing a similar pattern across the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which has confirmed that while in different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and care institutions should increase their preparedness for the rise in COVID-19 patients who will require health care and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a novel coronavirus, referring to coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild form of the disease, a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and the majority of these patients recover.
In 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 progressed to a severe illness requiring hospitalization, while another 6 percent had a severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends of the current increase in COVID-19 cases in each of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom and compared them to the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the countries of the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom with the number of cases in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
After invading China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the current rapid COVID-19 outbreak around the world is following the path of China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 Issue 5, Spiteri and others reported the first confirmed European cases of COVID-19 based on the World Health Organization's case data.
In Europe/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, which between 31 December 2019 and that date had a total of 39,768 cases, and 1,727 deaths were reported, of which 17,750 cases of infection and 1,441 of deaths were from Italy alone.
Taking the total and the sequential events of the number of COVID-19 cases.
At the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and local health authorities, and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
All these data were used to assess COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries as well as the UK and compared them with the Italian data.
As a representation of the active COVID-19 pandemic, we calculated the 14-day recurrence of COVID-19 cases based on the typical COVID-19 course in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also showed the increased number of cases of each country reported on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The state of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
The pattern in COVID-19 cases, which occurs on a cycle of approximately 14 days in the EU/EEA and the UK, follows the pattern in the case in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply on 28 February 2020. (additional documentation)
This was largely driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but other European countries/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increases in the frequency of COVID-19 events. (more...)
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom, compared to Italy, for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The report states that as of 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported significant numbers of cases, compared to Italy's numbers just three weeks earlier or even less.
Our results show that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The patterns observed in the recurrent events of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is evolving at a similar pace in all countries.
This is in contrast to countries that are in different stages of changing national public health responses and different case definitions in the country and different procedures for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 infection, including testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the worst-affected regions of Italy reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and several sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were working to their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 admissions in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to supplement current tracking data focused on the number of reported cases and deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the average care and intensive care capacity in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that these countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places for care and intermediate care per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
A model scenario involving healthcare exhaustion is provided in the ECDC's new sixth rapid COVID-19 risk assessment, with estimates for the EU/EEA and UK that COVID-19 patient admissions are at risk of exceeding critical care capacity of &gt; 90%.
Since many cases are concentrated in a few regions in Europe, the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and care facilities tend to serve only a limited number of local populations, information on cases and care facilities should be provided on the National Unit Terrestrial Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) page.
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries suggest that the global COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom.
Hospitals and care organisations across the country should therefore be carefully prepared for new scenarios of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be fluid and for the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and particularly high-level care, such as the case that is occurring in the affected areas in Italy.
As outlined in the ECDC's new Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, adaptive and comprehensive response approach is essential in delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from containment to mitigation, while a rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to adequately understand and respond if not implemented early and in a timely manner.
The rapid risk assessment also incorporates public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity in which countries can further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare organisations.
If this fails, the healthcare systems of the EU/EEA countries may be facing a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophic human consequences.
The virus is similar to its homologue, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003.SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mice and causes similar symptoms through a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious, affecting older people more than younger people, and men more than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will be talking about the basics of the epidemic, the etiology, the pathology, the diagnosis, the treatment, the prediction and the prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review study will help us understand and help eliminate this emerging threat.
The Chinese Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese, who were urged to stay indoors for the holidays and for weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003.It was therefore named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the other related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to about 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in 80,000 COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is public enemy number one and has even greater potential for terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research studies have been published on COVID-19, including studies of the virus, infection, cause, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which isolated the virus from several patients.
This review attempts to summarize the evolution of research in this rapidly evolving new discipline.
Where possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS, another disease caused by a coronavirus (CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as questions we urgently need to answer.
Typically, CoVs are considered non-pathogenic agents that are harmless to humans, most of which cause influenza, with about 15% of influenza 4 cases.
However, in this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic human coronavirus (CoVs) - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV - that caused outbreaks first in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread to many other countries with greater frequency and mortality.
Thus, COVID-19 is currently the third coronavirus (CoV) outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus (CoV) was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, a healthcare provider infection was reported, confirming that human-to-human transmission is possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed to all public transport.
On 24 January, the first practical experimental study of the disease revealed that of the 41 patients infected, only 21 had a direct connection to the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered a hotspot for the outbreak of the disease from unknown sources.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries in the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is slowly evolving, the final extent and severity of the outbreak continues to be monitored most carefully.
On 11 February 2020, a clinical cohort study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19, showed the following epidemiological prevalence (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs at any age, but most commonly in the age group of 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 of the cases were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000) in the same year.
COVID-19 has spread in large numbers in and around Hubei province.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is about 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The median duration from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basal strain count (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the correction R0 was 2.23-4.82.
Cases surged before January 23, 2020, due to a time of great traffic ahead of the Chinese holiday.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age, 60 years and older, and those with severe lung disease.
Coronaviruses, or CoVs, are a family of large, circular viruses that contain a single RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha, gamma, and delta, and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) binds to stimulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and subsequently the fusion of the two organisms occurs.
However, the viral RNA gene is passed into the cytoplasm.After the virus's genome is broken down, the RNA gene is surrounded by membrane glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forming a small pool that fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of the beta-CoV with greater than 99.98% genetic identity in 10 sequential samples collected from the origin of the outbreak, the Huangyan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through electron-transfer microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the lowermost part of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been found to be receptive to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than it binds to SARS-CoV, coinciding with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in causing virus infection and inhibiting IFNβ release. however, orf8 has no known functional domain or pattern.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryoEM structure of ACE2, a human-sized full-body 2.9 A with a B0AT1 complex of amino acid transporters.
They found that it was a complex, with open and closed conformations, fed by two dimers, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S proteins, all of which provided evidence in the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be a clinical target for a screening test to rule out infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The head and the middle of the tail
It is known that both SARS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet mice and MERS-CoV originated from camels.
Based on a comparison of the phylogenetic profile of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses (CoVs), the bat is considered to be the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS viruses that originated from the bat, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the mechanism that enabled the virus to pass from animal species to humans is still unclear, and its transmission is still unknown.
Ji and others suggested that snakes were the carriers of the virus from rats to humans, involving recombination of the same S-protein.
According to a study, a team of researchers in Guangzhou, China, showed that the bat, a long-beaked, shrimp-like reptile often used in traditional Chinese medicine, is a mid-range variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is likely based on 99% genetic material is the same as the coronavirus found in bats and the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, the 1% difference that extends to two genomes is still a large difference. Therefore, a consensus conclusion for the empirical evidence is awaited (Figure 33).
The physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not well known.
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and for 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 viruses may be similar.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was resistant to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes.Ethylene ether 75% sterilized chlorine-containing substances, perocetic acid, chromophores and various other non-chlorinated fatty substances can inactivate the virus.
The global population is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we just looked at previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, once the virus has invaded the mouse, it is first recognized by the mouse's internal immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptor receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), receptor-like NOD (NLR) and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) receptors.
In various ways, the virus induces the release of inflammatory agents, mature dendritic cells, and first-class interferon-inhibiting genes (IFNs), which inhibits the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytosis of the viral antigen.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune system.
Soon, the adaptive immune response will join in to fight the virus.
The T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a major role in the immune response.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to form a specific antibody against a specific virus, and the CDC8+ T cells kill the virus itself.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune system.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell function by inducing a form of T cell death.
The human immune system, including the C3a and C5a cells and the placenta, is also important in resisting infection with the virus.
For example, DNA isolated from recovered patients has normalized MERS-CoV.
Alternatively, an overreaction of the immune system produces a substantial amount of free radicals in the base, which can cause severe damage to the liver and other organs and in the worst-case scenario, organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the onset of cluster symptoms, is likely to affect older adults with the disease and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are susceptible to a large number of viruses, or who have a weakened immune system, to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most lasting 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, case studies of 1,099 patients have shown that the incubation period is 3 days on average and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
Another new study, as described above, shows that the recovery period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of effective vaccinations based on the most appropriate duration of the illness, thus preventing those who are infected but do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a matter of practice, individuals who have been exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should I take the test for 24 days?
Fever is the first and main symptom of COVID-19, which may be asymptomatic or have a combination of symptoms such as dry mouth, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headache, vomiting, nausea, chest pain, nausea, diarrhea, and cough.
Some patients have experienced breathing problems and/or low blood oxygen within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have begun to develop symptoms of shortness of breath, hyperventilation, acid reflux, excess digestion and blood clots.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of asthma and severe fever, even in the absence of a hepatic profile abnormality, should be screened for viruses for initial diagnosis.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the proportion of symptomatic patients was 98% for fever, 76% for cough, 55% for heat, and 3% for asthma, and 8% of patients required ventilation.
The same study showed that two recent studies of a family and a population were caused by infection from asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients had 98% fever, 47% dry cough, and 55% shortness of breath as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these patients require ventilation more than COVID-19 patients, and it is similar to MERS, which is more severe and more lethal than COVID-19.
Rhinitis (26%) and pulmonary embolism (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry throat (29%-75%), dysentery (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and abdominal pain (13-25%) were reported as the main symptoms, and ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% while the number of confirmed cases was 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to the mortality rate of SARS as of November 2002, it was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to its R0 and symptomatic rates is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more effective than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in spreading, but less deadly than the latter two viruses.
It is therefore more difficult to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of the disease is usually from a single family, or from a single gathering, or from a single trip, such as a cruise ship.
Patients generally have a history of traveling or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of contact with an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that humans can carry the virus asymptomatically for more than two weeks, and patients who have recovered and left the hospital can also be infected with the virus again, suggesting an emergency call to increase the time for an MRI.
Patients may have a normal or decreased number of lymphocytes in the early stages.
For example, 4×109/L lymphocyte count, including 1×109/L lymphocyte count, and the presence of bacteria in the blood and elevated amniotic fluid levels of aspartate were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of enzymes of liver, muscle and myoglobin were elevated in some patients' blood, and the C-reactive protein and electrocyte sedimentation were also elevated in some patients' blood.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer, a depleted product of fibrin, present in the blood is increased and the lymphocyte count is decreased sequentially.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by a double-speckled or double-speckled appearance on the lungs.
Patients often progress to abnormal bronchitis, severe liver injury, and symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When severe respiratory symptoms, uncontrolled swelling, fluid buildup and progression to pneumonia can result in an inability to move gas or air.
Disruptions of the type I and type II pneumocytes cause a decrease in surfactant levels and increase surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's non-growth capacity and increasing the risk of lung damage.
Thus, the findings of the worst chest reflexes are often consistent with the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, a primary analysis of COVID-19 showed the formation of pneumocytes, the formation of co-hyalins and the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and pulmonary endothelial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease, consistent with the pathogenesis of infection and ARDS and similar to the pathogenesis of infection of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by trans-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as a key diagnostic feature for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate that could accelerate the spread, clinical presentation was started to be used for diagnosis (which does not rely on RT-PCR alone) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of medical history, clinical evidence, laboratory test results, and X-rays is important and useful for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Chang's team described the procedure of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 orders per micrometer of input) using a biochemical filter in less than an hour without the use of critical equipment.
Hopefully, the new technique can help advance understanding of the underlying issues and provide a simpler, if consistent, experimental model.
Due to the lack of experience in treating the CoV, clinicians have only been able to provide post-operative care to COVID-19 patients while trying to test a variety of treatments that are already in use or previously recommended for the treatment of other coronaviruses (CoVs), such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other viral diseases. (table (Table2)2)
These treatments include current and potential treatments using antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma derived from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and counseling.
Even plasma from recovered patients is being proposed for treatment.
Many pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop a vaccine against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the liver and continues to attack other ACE2-expressing organs such as the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients, and are also a leading cause of death.
As such, respiratory support is essential to reduce symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, incoming exhaust air that does not contain flu, and mechanical ventilation that is accompanied by it, depending on the severity of the illness.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technique for supporting the cardiopulmonary circulation that is used to treat cardiac arrest and life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of post-infection and deep response to pathogens and protective function of key organs are all necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that the cyclone was caused by a strong immune system response in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine cyclone is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a sequence of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These proteins stimulate immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is necessary in the treatment of cytokine cysts, especially in patients with severe conditions.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a class of IL6 antagonists, are used to treat cytokine cyclones.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine cyclones include the modulation of T cell-directed immune responses, inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF, inhibition of JAK, use of blinomatumab, inhibition of cytokine signaling 4 and inhibition of HDAC.
Steroid medications, immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the progression of severe infections.
However, steroids in high doses are not useful in treating severe liver injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can lead to serious side effects, especially osteoporosis, which affects the prognosis.
However, short-term corticosteroids in low to moderate doses are recommended with caution for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, it was found that intravenous injections of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, were effective in one American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead Biopharmaceuticals initially for the treatment of infections caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibitory activity against co-RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China with the ingredients to conduct two human trials of SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with mild respiratory symptoms.
Epilepsy, vomiting, diarrhea, liver cell destruction and other reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
The blood donated by the recovered patients and the creation of the new body
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients who have the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, patients who have recovered eventually have high levels of antibodies to pathogens in their blood.
The antibodies are the immunoglobulins (ig) produced by B cells in the fight against infection, as well as other unusual substances that are not in the body, and they may have the ability to identify any molecule that causes disease and they kill that molecule themselves.
Based on this, plasma collected from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 will be injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, with a decrease in inflammation and viral load and an improvement in oxygen in the blood.
However, standardization and validation is necessary to propose methods for large-scale use before any specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, due to its therapeutic effects, some properties associated with the plant should be considered carefully.
For example, the antibodies can over-regulate the immune system response and trigger the symptoms of cytokine release, which can cause toxicity and death.
The amount of zinc in the blood is normally low and much plasma is needed for the treatment of patients with severe levels.
It is difficult to develop and produce a specific antibody quickly enough to combat the spread of the disease worldwide.
It is therefore more important and practical than ever to isolate B cells from a recovered patient and identify the gene that has been transferred or to screen for the gene that is active against the virus's key proteins.
This way, we can increase the production of organelles very quickly.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, its effects are mostly dependent on the combination of multiple compounds in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease, which is based on the principles of TCM.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to extract and store such ingredients or optimally store them.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild or moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe phase.
For example, the sulfonylurea and the hexagon tablets have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in provinces in China where TCM was used, with 87% of patients coming from Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxi (50%) and Hunan (50%) provinces, while Hubei, which used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%)
However, this is a hasty comparison, as many other influential factors such as the number and severity of the patient should be brought into consideration.
On February 18, 2020, Bo Li and colleagues published a study comparing Western-style therapy (WM) alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time needed for baseline body temperature, symptom resolution, and hospital stay for the WM+TCM group was shorter than for the WM group.
Most interestingly, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was remarkably lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the rate of mortality was lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still pending well-controlled clinical trials on a large scale and in many other centers.
It is also interesting to determine the mechanism of action and to confirm the efficacy of the components of TCM therapy or its combination therapy, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are highly fearful of the infection and potentially life-threatening, and people in isolation are also anxious, angry, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, dyspnea, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and mood disturbance.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, some complex psychological problems such as depression, depression, panic, irritability, sudden symptoms and suicide were reported.
The need for exposure monitoring and screening as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak may lead some people to be skeptical and misinformed about the impact of infection, screening and labeling on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals suspected of having the disease and people in their contact, as well as the general public who are in need of this care.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on treatment plans and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of electronic devices and professional software to avoid close or overly close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to contain the transmission of animal and human infections to susceptible pathogens, and these vaccines are usually given in addition to antiviral therapy to control the outbreak of disease caused by the newly emerging virus.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine from the S-protein to create a robust and long-lasting human immune system against SARS-CoV.
The live vaccine has been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these experimental live vaccines in adults and at-risk samples and their protection against zoonotic virus infection (transmission from animals to humans) must be determined before the practical experimental studies can be initiated.
This is probably because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases were reported.
In contrast, sporadic outbreaks and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission in the infected areas.
Vaccine production strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombined protein fragments, and some strategies have been taken to test and evaluate animal models.
Developing an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task for containment of the pandemic.
However, it remains a challenge to overcome this difficult situation, as a long time (generally 18 months) is needed to develop vaccines and rapidly adapt to the various CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to fully emerge in clinical trials, when patients are already in the thousands.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without any complications.
However, COVID-19, which is similar to SARS and MERS, has also been associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of predictive models for disease is necessary for healthcare agencies to prioritize their service delivery, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on empirical studies reported in the past, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age is the most important factor for predicting the likelihood of SARS and COVID-19 infections.
COVID-19 occurs predominantly in people aged 30-65, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years in the 8,866 case study as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have multiple sclerosis and complications of multiple sclerosis and were older than those who did not (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age was a determining factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000) as described above.
Confusion and confusion: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from cardiac arrest and severe cardiac arrhythmias.
Heart failure remains the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can infect ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, causing liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is also worth noting that age and disease are strongly correlated, which can have a direct effect on each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or traumatic injury and have been proposed as predictors of disease, response to treatment and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also mentioned.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during liver damage.
So they are a common symptom for heart or liver failure.
Significant empirical treatment symptoms: Chest X-rays and the time-to-evolution of empirical treatment symptoms should be considered along with other issues for predicting the outcome and consequences of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used in combination therapy for certain infections to reduce the severity of inflammation.
High doses of corticosteroids are used to treat severe SARS patients. Survivors suffer from vascular and bone loss, resulting in lifelong disability or reduced quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods for COVID-19 patients.
Emotional stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced unusual stress as they endured long and prolonged isolation, insecurity, and witnessed the death of close family members and other patients.
It is necessary to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to past demographic studies, COVID-19 appears to be distinct from the SARS pandemic.
In addition to transmission in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted through the upper respiratory tract and cause symptomatic or asymptomatic infections in the early stages of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause the common flu.
Thus, patients who are infected at an early stage or in an asymptomatic period may produce large amounts of the virus during their daily activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV is considered to have occurred when the patient is severely ill, whereas most infections did not occur at that early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
A massive effort is currently underway in China, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of curbing the further spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these activities have damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, which indicates a decrease in the spread of infections.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March, and the slowdown phase will last 3-4 months.
However, other experts do not share this view.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end by 2020.
Ira Longini and others developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect up to two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in the saliva and throat swabs of recovered patients who had been discharged from hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be a flu-like viral stage.
However, signs of an outbreak have emerged in China based on a declining number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through screening, quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
It is possible that due to its similarity to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 could become weakly infectious and eventually become extinct or a virus that causes rare human disease.
Comparisons of global outbreaks of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS are shown in the table below (Table (Table 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing, sneezing, or contact with any object that directly contains the virus.
The virus has also been found in saliva, which increases the new possibility of a saliva-to-mouth transmission.
A new study of 138 cases reports that 41% of the total cases were probably caused by hospital outbreaks, with 17 patients with chronic illness, including 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, the best precautions should be taken in protecting people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, as well as those who are in direct contact with the patient or the infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of masks. Both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirators (series # 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent the escape of water vapor from susceptible individuals, by preventing the airborne transport of the water vapor or its fall on the surface of other objects, where it can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 mask (series # 1860s) provides protection against the penetration of the virus with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus can penetrate the mask.
Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks that are layered, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (circa 1860) masks, but not surgical masks.
In addition to masking, healthcare providers should wear isolation goggles in order to further reduce direct contact with the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted to a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask.The virus probably entered his body through his swollen eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear face masks or eye protection when interacting with patients.
For the general population in areas of high or very high infection, all are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often and try to stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with susceptible individuals.
Three feet is considered an acceptable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its strong similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should make China extremely alert and should be clearly remembered about the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control had reassured his citizens that the new virus was low-transmissible, its transmission was limited from person to person, and there was no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message relaxed the public emergency, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, a crucial time in efforts to contain the disease when it was still relatively rare in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may be able to take this hard lesson and make optimistic improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements, because every word matters to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be alert and respond well to uninformed information coming from the clinic rather than waiting for a formal report from a doctor or official; (3) take additional precautions to contain possible outbreaks at an early stage, rather than trying to persuade others; and (4) more often engage in targeted and effective testing to increase public awareness of the disease and to monitor and respond to the social media system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide at the time of this writing.
Because the virus is structurally similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS resurgence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary for the prevention of the spread and for the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate for very old patients is also higher than for younger people.
SARS was more virulent than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus to others even if they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients do not have any symptoms when they are in a critical condition, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster than SARS-CoV.
The usual RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 may be absent in some COVID-19 patients.
In addition, patients who have recovered and recovered may be positive for the virus.
These findings greatly increase the risk of viral transmission.
With such rapid advances in COVID-19 research, there are some important issues to address as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS virus from bats, we cannot assume that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What is the intermediate animal that can transmit the virus from a primate, such as a bat, to a human?
Without knowing the first and second answers, we cannot effectively reduce the transmission or transmit, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can migrate and enter ACE2, how the virus enters respiratory cells and causes disease is not known.
Can the virus attach ACE2 secreting cells to other tissues?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot have rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve during transmission in humans?
Will it become a pandemic, or will it go away like SARS, or will it reappear like the pandemic?
It's important, but it may take some time to do the research to answer these questions and others.
However, no matter what it takes, we have no choice but to stop the spread and bring our lives back to normal.
Genetic origin of the human coronavirus
Mutation and self-replication have driven the existence of co-coronaviruses (CoVs) and protozoa, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human cases of human chovirus co-viruses (HCoVs) were found that cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shifted the focus to show how deadly and life-threatening HCoV infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has put the virus back on the hot list, surprising us with its high prevalence but turning out to be a decrease in disease-causing potential compared to its SARS-CoV cousin.
HCoV infections are zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans), and understanding the genetic origin of HCoVs may help us.
Most HCoVs are derived from bats, which are not pathogens.
A central storage medium of some HCoVs has been found.
Animal tissue identification has a direct effect on the prevention of human disease.
Investigation of the activity of the CoV-host in the animal body may provide important additional insights into the causation of CoV in humans.
In this review, we will present the current knowledge about the seven HCoVs and focus on the context of their discovery as well as the origin of animal-to-human transmission and gene-to-gene transmission.
More importantly, we compared and differentiated the HCoVs and theories of viral evolution as well as recombination of its genes.
The current 2019 CoV disease outbreak (COVID-19) was discussed in this context.
Further, they emphasized the need for successful viral replication and the impact of viral mutation on disease severity.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of RNA viruses that are monophyletic and single-stranded.
These viruses are giving rise to the largest genome, 26 to 32, in the viral RNA subunit, which is called CoVs because of their morphological resemblance to the microbe in the electron microscope.
CoVs have a structurally unfragmented genome under a similar cover.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large, heterogeneous transcript variants (ORF1a and ORF1b) that have been translated into the polyprotein viruses pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, which are identified by nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The helper proteins of some strains are also encoded by different CoV strains.
Based on the differences in protein sequence, COVs are divided into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV has the most HCoVs and is further subdivided into four subtypes (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of plant-human cloning has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant host of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have crossed animal ranges, and some have emerged as major human pathogens.
Seven human-CoVs have been identified to date.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 often cause mild symptoms such as a common cold and/or a sore throat.
In contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic agents that cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with a high proportion of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The HCoV-229E subtype B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, much knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause long-lasting symptoms.
Indeed, it is generally accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting over 8000 people and with a mortality rate of over 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory disease outbreak caused a steady spread across the Arabian Peninsula with a gradual spread to the rest of the world.
Novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world must prepare for the impending SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Seven HCoVs are genetically derived from bats, monkeys or domestic birds.
A large body of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from a mouse, where the virus is highly variable and non-pathogenic, but shows remarkable genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the genetic origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the biology, motivation and frequency of transmission from one species to another.
This could also help guide or facilitate the search for the main, intermediate, and late host of SARS-CoV-2 with important implications in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we provide a general overview of the origin of animal-to-human transmission, species-to-species transmission and the pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we noted and discussed a theme that states that the original strains of HCoVs are not pathogenic when they live in their original host, but become pathogenic after they have been transferred to a new host.
We also look at the mechanism of HCoV evolution, where an increase in transmission can often occur with a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
CoVs in animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E type B814 from the nasal secretions of people with normal influenza, different CoVs were isolated in various disease-causing animals, including chickens, turkeys, pigs, pigs, and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A chronological summary of HCoV detection (Table 1) will provide information and guidance.
The HCoV-229E gene was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common flu symptoms including headache, cough, diarrhea, and stomach pain with cough and coughing, which has been seen in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the feeding and sequencing sequences in the brain of a newborn monkey.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are characterized as being indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally and they tend to be transmitted mainly in winter in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation period of both viruses is less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a study of volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have evolved to a mild, moderate influenza.
Only patients with weakened immune systems exhibit severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as SARS-CoV-2, was the first HCoV-related pandemic in recorded human history, and the causative biological agent was SARS-CoV-2, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS may have occurred as early as late 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
As a result of the SARS outbreak, 8096 cases were reported, 774 deaths, and the outbreak spread to several countries and continents.
In addition to the high prevalence, it is estimated that each case can result in about two subsequent cases over a period of 4 to 7 days, with the peak of the virus occurring on the 10th day after infection.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience muscle aches, heartburn, fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath, followed by coughing and wheezing, which are mild symptoms.
Lymphomania, test-deficit liver function and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
SARS patients were observed to have a large number of lung tumors, a rapid increase in epithelial cells, and an increase in blood platelets.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require continuous intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract infections, many organs including the stomach, liver, lungs and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a buildup of cytokines, which can be life-threatening in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from a lung swab of a relative of a patient who had travelled to Hong Kong from Taiwan.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems with respiratory illnesses.
Expressions of fever, dysentery, coryza, eye infection, fever, and pneumonia are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a urine sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of the common respiratory tract disease and its peak incidence is in early summer, autumn and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with dysentery and bronchitis, known as croup disease.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community-acquired pneumonia, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe respiratory illness.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild gastrointestinal illness.
All of the HCoVs received in these four communities have adapted well in humans and are generally less likely to cause high infectivity, although some cases have occurred without known cause, such as the rare case of the HCoV-NL63 strain that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, once these HCoVs have acquired the ability to transmit effectively and to persist in humans, they become either benign or malignant.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed chronic bronchitis and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
In most cases confirmed by laboratories originating in the Middle East, imported cases were reported, with a secondary outbreak occasionally due to close contacts in countries in Europe and Tunisia.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by an increasingly severe case of chronic bronchitis.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed chronic respiratory illness, which is unique to MERS among HCoV-induced illnesses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses humans have ever encountered.
During mid-to-late December 2019, a group of pneumonia patients previously associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, worldwide confirmed cases were 90,053 with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2% while the percentage outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have been shown to cause fever, cough and shortness of breath.
They also found some patients with leprosy.
Pneumonia is one of the more serious symptoms and can rapidly progress to a severe respiratory crisis.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in nature due to a high 82% similarity in their nuclear sequences, they diverged into different branches in the circulating genome.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but it is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and contrasts between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six HCoVs groupings reveal similarities and differences of remarkable benefit.
First, the duration of the awakening and the duration of the HCoV evolution are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is dependent on SARS-CoV and the four groups of HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited some features similar to the community-acquired infection of HCoVs, with little or no symptoms.
In other words, a small sample of severe COVID-19 cases is seen, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although with a slightly lower proportion.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 replication also reveals interesting features of community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, at least the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 may be as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be re-evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is reduced after transmission to other people, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva samples.
Whether or not the oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role as significantly as in the case of SARS-CoV is at least under some speculation that remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed seasonally, as is the case with community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the nature of SARS-CoV-2 as a pathogen, including its infectivity, pathogenicity, and its human-to-human spread, will trigger an outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, it may be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, they could both be survivors of the HCoV pandemic from the past.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that evolve to severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
For all this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in the human body to have enough capacity to accumulate against the host defense mechanism.
In this sense, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts longer and more people become infected, it has a greater chance of becoming human-to-human.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to contain, even with social distancing or other infection control measures.
In recent years, four groups of CoVs have been known to infect humans with symptoms similar to those of the influenza virus, with strong immune systems.
These viruses do not need to be hosted in animals.
In contrast, highly virulent SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans, and their transmission in humans is unlikely to be stable.
They need to maintain and reproduce within their eusocial habitats and seek opportunities to reach more easily infected prey targets via intermediate and evolved hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and all four subtypes of HCoVs.
It is as slowly transmissible as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is more virulent than community-acquired HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It's still seen as fully integrated into the human body and running inside the human body without the need for a middleman or middleman.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it would be helpful to discuss the concept and evolutionary nature of the HCoVs, their intermediate and evolutionary stages.
Animals act as the evolutionary host of HCoVs if they are closely related to an ancestor that shares high similarity at the level of the Thai blue sequence.
Over time, the old virus adapts well and does not affect the soil.
Also, the HCoVs will remain in the reservoir for a long time.
In both cases, the mosquito is usually infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its original parasite.
Conversely, if HCoVs have recently appeared in the central nervous system immediately prior to or during their introduction to humans, they may not have adapted well to the new nervous system and are often not pathogenic.
These intermediate fungi are the source of animal-to-human transmission and act as vectors, allowing the bacteria to multiply and then spread to humans to spread more viruses.
HCoVs may stop transmitting if the virus cannot be transmitted from its host medium.
Conversely, HCoVs can adapt to the medium and even cause long-term spread.
In this case, the central lobe becomes the natural stomach lobe.
Data from epidemiological studies have previously shown that observed cases of SARS have a history of interaction with animal-related pathogens.
Results from blood tests showed that the animal traders had higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG concentrations compared to the general population.
Pigeons and raccoons sold in live markets were the first to be identified as carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is similar to, but not identical to, SARS-CoV.
It was supported by the fact that no further SARS cases were reported after killing all the cattle on the market.
However, it has been reported that wild or farmed shrimp, without affecting live markets, are highly resistant to SARS-CoV, suggesting that shrimp may only act as a medium-resistant host, but not a natural host of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that multiple small animal donors could serve as intermediate vectors of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for SARS-CoV's natural animal stain revealed a close relationship to the CoV in bats, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse-foot bats.
These bats are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This virus and other variant CoVs share 88-92% percent of the nucleotide sequence similarity of the genotype.
These studies laid the foundation for the new idea that rats act as human reproductive agents.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from mice, but only one identified WIV1 can differentiate into a live virus.
Human angiotensin enzyme-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from rat saliva has been demonstrated in the use of mouse and human ACE2 receptors for cell transplantation.
Interestingly, the serum oxygen receptor (SERA) of SARS patients was able to bind to WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in mice, sharing a 95% sequence homology with the nucleotide.
Although the two viruses are very similar, it is believed that WIV1 is not the original host of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the host of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as the mouse CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a single receptor, peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is more closely related to that of the beta-CoV in bats, which has been identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, MERS-CoV has not been found living in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and CoV-HKU25 in bats, its closest relative, have a similar share of the platelet sequence of 87%.
Therefore, the mice may not be the central reservoir of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels have a specific immunity to MERS-CoV that is similar to that of camels native to the Middle East in many African countries.
MERS-CoV, which is similar in structure to the virus found in humans, was isolated from a camel snout sample, further demonstrating that camels act as the true hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that while the symptoms are generally mild, there has been a significant transmission in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels transmitted the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the urethra to the mouth, which is also a major channel for transmission from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of camel-related onset, with confirmed human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission route involving an unknown animal species that provides the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide affinity with the RaTG13 CoV in bats, which was isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence overlap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so large that no direct relationship can be established.
These suggest that bats may not be the central reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 unless CoVs are found in mice with similar identities in the future.
The intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to be among the wild animal species that were sold and killed at the Hainan seafood market, where most of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, suggesting an event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenetic sequencing have shown that a group of small, near-extinct animals known as the man-eating man-eating man-eating man-eating man may also be ancestral to the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
CoV genomes in these newly introduced species share a molecular sequence similarity of 85-92% with that of SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of the Thai nucleotide sequence.
They are two small SARS-CoV-2 virus-like isolates in a single gene pool, one bacterium having a receptor similar to SARS-CoV-2 and the same amino acid content of 97.4%.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are different, although the same genome sequence is more highly conserved.
Recent studies of infected rats have shown the presence of viral infection in lung samples that are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a different assembly method as well as a fine-grain amplification of any part of the genome, which was approximately 86.3% of the genome size of the virus.
We cannot consider bats as a continuum for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from mice directly due to sequential transitions between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in mice.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 tends to be shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in bats.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, bats and other mammals has not yet been established.
The highest order similarity was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related amphibian beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 contributing the highest genome-wide order similarity.
It is strongly estimated that the high degree of similarity between RBDs of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in caps and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by coevolution, which facilitates selection.
The proposal is to replace the combination of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV in the primate and RaTG13 in the third wild species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on the immediate genetic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly virulent HCoVs, the genomic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Evidence from the epidemiology suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoVs in mice, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat-specific CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was found in a North American tricolored bat that exhibited similar characteristics to HCoV-NL63.
In addition, HCoV-229E is genetically similar to another bat-type CoV, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana and is suspected to have been transmitted to camels.
For clarity, current knowledge of the evolution of HCoVs in known species is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of human-animal DNA has provided evidence for the historical animal-to-human transmission of HCoVs.
Outbreaks of respiratory infection were documented when HCoV-OC43 crossed from animals to humans from domestic poultry around 1890.
The history of animal-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs in bats were found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Many studies have identified direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, non-human camels, alpacas, and bats can interact with each other in a shared bioregion.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the bat-associated alpha-CoVs of HCoV-229E are heterogeneous and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-Cov (alpaca alpha-CoV) causes respiratory illness outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in the unvaccinated wild animal.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas received the related alpha-CoV HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that infect humans, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alpha-CoVs in bats act as the host of HCoV-229E, in alpacas and the Mediterranean monkeys they may act as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of animal-to-human transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at its initial identification and has been extended through subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich variety of viruses for the exchange of genetic material and transcription from one species to another.
Longevity, large herds, close-in cohorts and high flight capacity are the rewarding conditions for bats to become a 'viral spreader'.
MERS-CoV has been transmitted to camels for decades.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have changed from medium-sized animals to normal carnivores.
MERS-CoV causes severe acute illness and maintains a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its unstable transmission to humans is a random event, and humans remain the last remnant of MERS-CoV whose transmission cannot be sustained.
If there is any overlap between the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV and the role of domestic animals in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, there is a difference.
In particular, the beta-CoVs of the mosquito are highly pathogenic agents in mosquitoes.
They may be the last known alternative for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, which resemble the larvae in the case of SARS-CoV.
The multiple possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 must be addressed or eliminated in future studies.
First, bats may be the host organism of SARS-CoV-2, which has almost identical characteristics to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological role with bats through the hunt for meat or minerals.
Second, the mosquito could have been part of the central mosquito pathogen where the virus associated with SARS-CoV-2 was first transmitted.
Humans acquire the virus by killing the animal and eating its flesh.
It is possible that many animal species, including domestic pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of local fauna and flora for the conservation organization are guaranteed.
Thirdly, as described above, recombination and conservation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a tertiary animal species associated with bats and bats.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals continues.
In addition to the various types of animal vectors, three main bacterial factors are also important in the adaptation of CoVs to cross the animal vector.
First, high-mobility RNAs are related to their RNA transcription.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered medium to high with a replacement rate of on average 10 to 4 replacements per year at a range of 2 depending on the stage of adaptation of CoVs to the new strain.
CoVs have a nuclear receptor that has a controlled elimination function, resulting in high mutation and inhibition or even inhibition.
Interestingly, the nucleotides of Remdesivir are known to inhibit CoV degradation by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes.
Remdesivir is one of the most successful SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of morphological mutation of these CoVs is billions of times higher than the mutation in their hosts.
In addition, mutation rates are often high as CoVs are not well adapted to the environment.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is substantially lower, indicating a high degree of adaptation to humans.
So it's adapted to other organisms that are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to the wild.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the gene sequence will be able to produce a vaccine and antibody to SAES-CoV-2 that is effective in a short time.
Second, the large RNA genomes in these CoVs are highly sequential, which means that they are able to differentiate and replicate.Therefore, transition from one type to another may occur, which means that the outbreaks of CoVs are timely.
It is supported by a fully differentiated reading scheme and a protein function that transcodes towards the 3rd final genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change the pattern of RNA fragmentation through a unique selective transcriptional machinery.
In the serotypic strains, line switching occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
The strong similarity of the full-length and RNAs genomes can combine to form a new CoV.
Evidence of naturally occurring recombinant mutations has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in bat-like animal CoVs such as SL-CoV and bat-like CoV-HKU9.
Viral and viral infections are associated with transmission
In addition to the three viruses identified above, viral interaction with the enteric receptor is another important factor influencing animal-to-human transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is accepted as a common example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during animal-to-human transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of the isolation between human and mammalian SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid decomposition in various membranes, especially with changes in the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S-proteins of CoVs is interacting with the cell receptor and is selected in response to the human genome.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in amino acids 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE 2 receptor cells of various animals including dogs, bats, bats, mice and dogs, allowing the virus to be transmitted.
In fact, there are only 6 amino acid residues observed separately from the human and civet viruses in RBD, and all four of them are located in the receptor-interacting receptor binding pathway with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV in monkeys has mutations in the K479N and S487T genes in its RBD that may increase the likelihood of large protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In turn, these two amino acid substitutions may be important in the pathogenesis of humans.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same molecular identity as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein indicates that the binding of its S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, cryo-EM studies have shown a 10 to 20 times higher affinity of this compound than between humans with ACE2 and SARS-CoV's S-protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether other excitatory receptors may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different S subunit.
There are several other receptors for HCoVs, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after their animal-to-human transmission.
In addition to the neural surface for cell reception, the outcome of animal-to-human transmission of HCoVs is also influenced by other host-dependent and other constraints.
Differences in host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as mice, dromedary camels and rodents may be a factor in transmission between species.
HCoVs must take on the host's inheritance and modify the host's conservation factors for successful transmissions of the hybrid strain.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in the main part of the virus's evolution are still to be identified and characterized.
A non-invasive genome-wide sequencing of the susceptibility of mosquitoes and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced technology of CRISPR could be fruitful.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of CoVs in bats provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as the genetic precursors of HCoVs.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and recombination of genes also promote HCoV evolution and play two key roles in this process.
For example, the reception or loss of a gene that codes for a new protein has the potential to significantly modify the epoprotein gene.
ORF8 among other proteins of SARS-CoV has been identified as important in human metabolism as the SARS-CoV virus isolated from rats, but was found to encode the ORF8 protein differently.
The 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs was found in the lineages that were isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination of ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b is thought to be self-similarity induced by the transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV is recombinant with alpha and gamma-CoVs, with large numbers of small isolates known in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The reassembly point is also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the spread of MERS-CoV was due to a recombination event between different strains that occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs incorporate other animal co-ovars in a genetically unstructured fashion.
Selective breeding should be done with caution as it can cause the virus to be genetically modified by accident, which can result from viral degradation through selective pressures such as the immune system of mosquitoes.
An example of these effects is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E sequence caused by the deletion of two nucleotides.
While the full ORF4 could be observed in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha CoV (alpaca alpha-CoV) exhibits a single nucleotide insert that causes mutation.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their host membranes.
Asymptomatic or asymptomatic sex is detected when the bat is infected with CoVs, indicating cross-breeding between CoVs and the bat.
It has been shown that the rat is well adapted to the physiology and biology of CoVs.
For example, errors in the activation of anti-inflammatory responses in mice effectively reduce the pathogenicity caused by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mice was suppressed due to the increased cellular response of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell receptor and the lower concentration of the complex first-class molecules of the differentiated immunity.
In addition, the highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the higher metapolysis activity of the mice can inhibit CoV transmission and affect exoribonuclease analysis, thus providing a selective pressure for the generation of highly infectious viruses when they enter the new host.
Many other pathogenic viruses of the CoV family can also evolve by recombining, resulting in new genes or proteins with specific binding to their hosts.
So it is no coincidence that three HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic agents or they only cause symptoms in the gastrointestinal tract, such as measles and measles.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong immune response.
Below are the secrets of detecting asymptomatic carriers and the causes of severe human infections.
The most severe symptoms are caused by a decrease in immune system and cytokine levels, where a stronger immune response leads to more severe liver damage.
Conversely, if you are infected but have no symptoms, it means that your immune system is not yet active in relation to the isolation of the CoV virus.
The same strategy of suppressing the immune system response may be effective in treatment against SARS-CoV-2 disease.
The response of the pheromone was particularly strong in mice.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon-expressing proteins, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
Furthermore, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in mice was ineffective.
For this reason, suppressing inflammation with NLRP3 with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 disease is similar to the general area where SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occur.
Beta-CoV shares 95% of the nucleotides with SARS-CoV that we have found.
Orphans and other animals on the market have been found to have the same viral sequence as SARS-CoV, but the direct vector for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.
Beta-CoVs found in the mouse body were found to be highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the mouse may play a role as one of many hosts or that the Beta-CoVs may help provide genetic information to the next generation of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there is some doubt, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was man-made or accidentally introduced.
CoVs have returned to normal due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the importance of the origin of animal-to-human transmission and the location of HCoVs in human transmission.
Infectious evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through the intermediate host.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from human-civet contact in markets, the closure of meat markets and slaughterhouses and the killing of civets should have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
For the same reason, poultry should be removed from wet markets to prevent genotoxic (animal-to-human) infections, due to the multiple host-specificity of the lineage group in which poultry beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, how and whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via bats and other primates remains to be clarified in future investigations.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather products and sheep wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore not possible to kill all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wildlife markets in China to contain the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop a recurrent MERS outbreak, a method should be developed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other disease control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge to cause outbreaks.
Many animal-to-human CoVs are circulating in the wild.
Particularly, bat-borne CoVs that can be transmitted from animals to humans are different.
There is a high probability that these CoVs can evolve or regrow, causing new CoVs that may cause future transmission and death.
China should abandon the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of the country to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Better preparedness and response planning is needed with the painful experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
In fact, viruses have been around for a long time.
They live in their normal environment until they have a chance to reproduce.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of the virus, humans can minimize their exposure to bats and other wildlife species if they are trained to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of the animal is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases is to keep people away from the ecosystems where the germs can infect humans.
Many fragments remain to be found in the genomic profile of the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
If, for example, bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to bats, it is interesting to see under what conditions bats and bats may have similar characteristics to the ecological microbe.
Second, if bats play the most direct role in transmitting to humans, then they should be monitoring how humans interact with bats.
Third, if the third animal acts as a mediator, they are only specifying how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats and mammals.
Finally, some animal species, including domestic pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If the mice, rats, or other animal hybrids are infected, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical progenitor virus will be identified in its native saliva in the future.
Further investigation in this area will help to reveal how SARS-CoV-2 evolved in animals, which is of great relevance to the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the COVID-19 diagnostic profile of suspected and confirmed cases is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Rapid Guidance Principles for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and these guidelines provide our experience and a guiding document for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
But the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge is constantly increasing based on the results of ongoing research and practical experience.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, our team quickly developed a guideline and it was disseminated online in the Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge is increasing steadily based on ongoing research and clinical experience, so the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines on diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020) issued a total of seven publications, some of which were substantially altered.
Now our guidelines have been interpreted by Zhou et al. They suggested a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidelines and is a valuable reference document for the global pandemic.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
But their work also needs updating in light of the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, one element of the epidemiologic profile must be combined with two elements of the symptom profile to make a comprehensive analysis or the requirement to meet the three criteria if the epidemiologic profile is not clear:
epidemiological history: (1) history of travel to or residence in Wuhan and surrounding cities or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with a cold or respiratory symptoms patient from Wuhan and surrounding cities or other communities with reported COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days after symptom onset; (4) history of a previous contact with the cause of the infection (≥ 2 cases of cold/cold or respiratory symptoms occurred in the last 2 weeks in small areas such as offices, homes, etc.)
Clinical presentation: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristic features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total blood cell count showing a normal decrease or a decrease in lymphatic counts at the initial stage.
Diagnosis of infection should be based on a suspected case with any of the following: (1) a positive time-reported PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (2) whole genome sequencing of the virus showing high similarity to known coronaviruses (3) positive positive IgM and secret IgG antigens for SARS-CoV-2 in a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 serogroup or ≥4 times in the retrieval phase, which is at the stage of the latent stage.
We can see that the polymerase chain reaction test for nucleic acid in a tube sample or blood is included in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenicity of the blood sample was included in the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020), and then the evidence from the blood analysis was included in the seventh edition.
These changes rely on researchers continuing to work to find the best nucleic acid detector for rapid diagnosis as well as respiratory pump samples, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and helps bring positive results of the test into the diagnostic profile.
There is also much more evidence that warns us to be cautious with patients with abnormal symptoms and asymptomatic.
Therefore, the flow charts of Zhou et al. should be updated as they considered people without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The system also requires more clinical and practical parallelism.
To conclude, we hope that more first-hand evidence will come and invite readers to give their opinions.
For the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend that they follow and adhere to the latest guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that the number of recorded cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were residing at home.
The death toll was recorded at 17.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two of the cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that the two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
Hospital officials told Anadolu, a local media outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the head of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be shut down for a longer than planned period until Saturday.
The public travel ban began on 26 March and is scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods such as medicine, fuel and food is still allowed.
An initial report on March 8 showed that two cases of Covid-19 in Bangladesh were among two people who had returned from Italy, one of whom was the wife of a traveller.
All three patients were recovered as of March 19.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected over one million people worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University data on Thursday, the number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections has reached over one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 people have died as a result of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus.
A major development occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first case and Egypt had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it was one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, with at least 5,900 deaths attributed to the disease.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 people died Wednesday from coronavirus infections.
Around the world, many countries have declared strict emergency measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Governor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
In the country, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would receive a paycheck without having to go to work until April 30.
Puerto Rico voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was approved by 215 votes in favor, ten votes in favor, and one against.
Saudi Arabia has added a day-long curfew in the main cities of Mecca and Medina, previously in effect between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have a low rate of paper usage per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian department store Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase of toilet paper to two and one-pack in operation in all stores nationwide.
On Monday, the ALDI newsletter also suggested a package limit.
These domains are posted on checkpoints and on Facebook.
Customers are reportedly buying storage items due to fears of COVID-19 in case they need to be quarantined.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper to one package per order for home delivery.
These changes were made following the four-digit re-purchase sizing measures introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 December respectively.
"In its media release on March 8, Coles reported that with the four-pack limit, ""many stores sold out of stock within an hour of shipment"" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday".
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales have been on a "huge" upswing in the past week.
Costco's Canberra store also set the number of permitted packages to two last week.
To cut the deficit, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increase the speed of shipment, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI created stock for the project, which had been planned for a special battery earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, president of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to bring the cattle into the warehouse, but the restrictions imposed by the council on the timing of the trucks' arrivals had caused problems.
He expects that the cost of production will increase as suppliers try to meet demand and have fewer special skills.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the initial store release, some stores will not be able to run the Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores were filling up every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was of two shells, which led to a shortage of stocks, and that when sold, the large containers left a shortage of storage space.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that "Colos and Walcott have the view [that] if there are a lot of things on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and detergent can be bought and are moderate, you can probably reduce the fear a lot".
Who Gives a Crap, the maker of toilet paper made from recycled paper, said Wednesday that it was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue and Solaris paper and makes toiletries, said it was working 24/7 to maintain its supply, according to News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that a real estate agent gave away toilet paper free to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne when bidding was delayed because buyers were taking a break on Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of the NT News, printed daily in Darwin, included eight pages of content meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops were initially hesitant to impose the restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on 3 March, saying they had no plans to introduce a strict restriction on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including face masks, sanitary masks, dryers, hand dryers and towels.
Similarly, this Sunday afternoon, outside Australia, the UK's Ocado online store was seen to impose a limit on purchases of Andres toilet paper up to 12 boxes.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced an outbreak of COVID-19, caused by a virus caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "epidemic" refers to how the disease is spread, and not just to specific cases, the World Health Organization has noted the need to urge governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said that if countries find out about the virus, isolate them and mobilize their populations in response.
We are deeply concerned both by the level of prevalence and severity of the emergency and the level of unemployment emergency.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is unprecedented.
In a speech published by CNN in February, he said that apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from its emergence to its continued spread around the world.
Ghebreyesus expressed similar sentiments, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus before".
"And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled in one go", he continued.
The new pandemic situation, which follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the spread of the disease a public health emergency of international concern, is a major concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Control, said the outbreak "will get worse".
As of Thursday, the news agency reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak is a continuation of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported from 210 countries and regions, with a total of 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while for the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
The consequences may include pneumonia and severe respiratory symptoms.
From the time of contact with the patient to the onset of symptoms, it is generally detectable in five days, but can be detected in between two and fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or treatment with specific antiviral drugs.
The first stage of treatment is symptom-based treatment and support.The recommended precautions include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping away from others, and monitoring and isolating those suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, bans, workplace safety checks and lockdowns.
The pandemic has caused worldwide economic, social, and political disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and media, supply shortages caused by fear-induced buying.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting an estimated 99.4 percent of students worldwide.
Fake news about the virus has spread online, and it has even caused xenophobia and anti-Chinese prejudice, among other East Asian and Southeast Asian natives and others from the affected areas.
Reduced travel and severe industrial shutdowns have resulted in a drop in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported a case of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Hunan seafood market, and thus the virus is thought to be of Juno origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, was a recently discovered virus that is closely related to the coronavirus in rats, the coronavirus in bats, and the SARS-CoV virus.The first symptomatic individual was found to have later developed illness on 1 December 2019, and the individual was not directly exposed to the virus group found in the herb market.
In the first round of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds of patients were found to have originated from the market.
On 13 March 2020, unconfirmed reports from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case from 17 November 2019 in a 55-year-old from Hubei Province may have been the first case.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that new cases were reported to have decreased in China, but that there was a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea.Outside of China, the number of new cases has surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be no reported cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, some cases were reported among adolescents aged 19 and under, representing 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief medical adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would have been infected before achieving effective immunisation.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and their test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had issued official guidelines not to test people with mild symptoms, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and these unrecorded infections were the source of transmission in 79% of the recorded cases.
Statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline sequence number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that it could be as high as 5.7%.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For countries without, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common time being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, there were approximately 97,000 deaths caused by COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of the deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% had cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to those who have tested positive for COVID, according to official statistics.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 could be higher because it does not include people who died without testing - for example, at home, in care facilities, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the total number of deaths covered by official services by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know [the death toll] is an underestimate", a statement confirmed by the reporting of the undercount in the US.Such overestimation often occurs during pandemics, for example, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.The first death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, several deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the quality of testing, health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated mortality ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptom onset between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onset after 1 February 2020).Other measures include case-by-case mortality rate (CFR), reflecting the proportion of diagnosed people who died from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), reflecting the proportion of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics do not date and do not track specific populations of cases through case resolution.
Some studies have attempted to estimate these numbers for specific populations.
The Evidence-Based Medicine Center of the University of Oxford estimated the infection mortality rate for the overall pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimates of the range are consistent with the results from the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and the CFR's study of the statistical impact of testing on estimates.
WHO claimed that the epidemic is manageable.
Peak and late period of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said that with the remaining lack of control, the outbreak spiked, then began to decline once the disease was no longer contagious.
But it's almost impossible to make reasonable estimates now about when that will happen.
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, claimed that it could be over by June if all countries could be mobilized to follow World Health Organization recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
" On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the School of Tropical and Aesthetic Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 ""may continue to circulate for another year or two""".
" According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary ""until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or longer) """.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's probably impossible that the coronavirus, because it's ready for transmission, won't go away completely, and it could turn into a seasonal disease, allowing it to come back every year".
The rate of re-emergence of the strain will depend on the resistance of the population and the size of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be associated with uncertainty, and infected individuals may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, phlegm production, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and bone pain, dry mouth, headache, nausea, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or skin discoloration.The WHO states that approximately one in six people experience severe pain and respiratory distress.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immediate symptoms such as shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or sudden nausea, difficulty breathing, and facial or oral bleeding.Emergency medical attention is recommended if these symptoms persist.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, but there are test results that confirm infection, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with an infected person should be screened and monitored for contagion.
Chinese estimates of the unrepresented ratio are as low as 44%.
The normal wake period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one day to 14 days, a common range of five days.The uncertainty factor estimates the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell initially to 30% and later to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still unclear.
The disease is believed to be spread primarily during intimate contact and by small water droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking, with close contact ranging from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that uncontrolled coughing can lead to a drooling distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by small amounts of fluid that is long-term in the atmosphere, which may be produced during speech.Some respiratory secretions may also be produced during exhalation, including speech, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The saliva may fall on the mouth, or the nostrils of people nearby, or be absorbed into the lungs by inhalation.
Some medical procedures such as blood transfusions and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause a pulmonary embolism, which blocks the flow of air and can cause a pulmonary embolism.
It can also be spread when a person touches a naked surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that it could spread through the source of the virus, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of direct oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus.The virus is most infectious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission can occur earlier in the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that infection is possible before the development of major symptoms.
There were only a few reports of asymptomatic cases that were laboratory-confirmed, but the transmission was limited by some countries during the follow-up investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated that while it is not yet completely clear how the disease spreads, one person can transmit it to two to three people.The virus can survive for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus has been found to survive on polypropylene bags for three days, 304 hours on inorganic steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four days on tablecloths.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.Foreign and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after other outdoor contact with potentially infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, originally isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory syndrome case in Wuhan.
All features of SARS-CoV-2 are present in a virus related to the coronavirus in nature.Outside the human body, the virus will be sterilized with household soap that can be applied to its protective membrane.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to have originated from animal infection.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the betacoronaviruses of the subfamily Saberoviruses (genus B) together with two bat-derived species.
It is 96 percent similar at the genetic level to another bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in the genetic material between a virus from a monkey and a gene from a human.
A comprehensive comparison of genomes found that almost 92% of the genetic material was shared between bats and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to confirm that bats are intermediate hosts.
A viral infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on initial symptoms, although final confirmation must be made by a positive rRT-PCR of the transcribed material or a CT scan.
A comparative study of the polymerase chain reaction to CTI in Wuhan showed that CTI is more susceptible to polymerase chain reaction, with many of its features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes, though not specifically.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used to test for, or be the first choice for, COVID-19 testing.
The World Health Organization has released multiple RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first release on 17 January.
Testing using the polymerase chain reaction transcriptional rearray (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be performed on a respiratory sample or blood sample.
Usually, results are available within a few hours to a day.
Most commonly, the test is performed on a nasal swab, although a post-nasal swab may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing a randomized test that detects the placenta.
As of 6 April 2020, these documents have not been validated enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, silicone-based syringes are approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Features of imaging on X-ray and CT Tomography (CT) images of people with symptoms include a mirrored appearance on the ground and a lightless environment.
The Italian Radiological Society is collecting international online data on the visual findings for the confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without PCR is particularly useful in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and found that although the images were not specific to the transcript, they were faster and more responsive, suggesting that its test was a diagnostic tool in the epidemic.
Neural networks based on artificial brain solutions were developed to capture images of the virus with both X-ray and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding unwashed contact with eyes, nose or mouth, and coughing or sneezing, using a mouthwash and discarding the mouthwash in the trash.
Those who may have already been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Isolation measures have been introduced to contain the spread of the disease.Many governments have imposed restrictions or imposed travel bans on non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some community members do not know where and how they became infected.Healthcare providers who are caring for anyone who may have contracted the virus are advised to use standard precautions, contact and eye protection.Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of infection and to prevent further infection.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, several teams are working on privacy solutions such as using a Bluetooth to locate nearby users.
Users will receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misinformation being promoted about infection prevention methods, such as nasal spraying and mouthwash, is ineffective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many agencies are working on one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least fifteen seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visible to be dirty, before eating, and after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body the virus is killed by household soap, which increases its defence.
The CDC further recommends using hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surface can be disinfected with a few sprays (within a minute after application of an antifungal agent for the inert surface) including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.27.5% iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that if a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 is found in an office or daycare setting, such as a bathroom, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, computers, microphones, and ATM machines used by patients should be disinfected.
The WHO recommends that people who have mouth and nose infections should use a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or use a tissue when coughing or sneezing and discard the tissue immediately.
Medical tests are recommended for those who are at risk of infection by wearing a mask, measuring the amount of infection and fluid discharge when speaking, coughing and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus researcher at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask can reduce people's fear of contact with their own skin, one of the main sources of infection without proper hand hygiene.Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who are susceptible to the disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks in high-risk situations, such as caring for COVID-19 patients, etc. However, they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid exposure to their own faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by members of the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends masks made from plastic, not medical masks.China specifically recommends the public, especially those in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or closer) with others, use disposable medical masks.
Hong Kong recommends masks when people travel on public transport or when in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage people to make masks out of napkins at home and wash them daily.
Czech and Slovak citizens are banned from going out in public without a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam recommended that you wear a mask when going out in public to protect yourself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone entering a store must wear a face mask.
Israel urged all citizens to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and buses to wear masks by April 1.
Panama has required masks to be worn when outdoors and even introduced handmade masks for those who cannot afford them.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as social distancing) includes transmission control measures that aim to delay the spread of disease by reducing close contact between people.
The measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closing schools, workplaces, gyms, restaurants, or shopping malls, etc.
Individuals can practice social distancing measures by staying home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using non-contact methods of welcoming and self-quarantine.
Many governments are now restricting or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (if there was no local COVID-19 outbreak) to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of two or more people.Adults and people with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system are at higher risk of severe and chronic disease.In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organisations began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing" to emphasise that the aim of cutting is to reduce physical distance while maintaining social contact at a distance or distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has the effect that people should be in a state of complete social isolation rather than encouraging them to be in contact with others through other means.Some authorities have announced sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include the recommendation to only have sex with a live-in partner who is free of the virus or has symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for proper quarantine, and many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all people living in areas affected by the disease.
Self-isolation recommendations were issued for those in high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a highly contagious country or region are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of last exposure.
The strategy to manage the outbreak is to manage the situation, contain it and reduce the severity.
This is done in the early stages of an outbreak and is intended to track and isolate those who have been infected as well as introducing other measures of control, transmission and vaccination to stop the disease from spreading to the general population.
When the spread of the disease cannot be contained, efforts are then made to reach the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health and social systems.
Combination, condition control and mitigation measures may be implemented simultaneously.
Containment requires more aggressive measures to contain the epidemic by continuously reducing the number of cases to less than 1 percent of control, the spread of infectious diseases is trying to reduce the maximum rate of spread, known as the transmission limit.
This reduces the risk of health services becoming compromised and provides more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that could control the outbreak included self-defense measures such as hand hygiene, face masks, and isolation; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as lockdowns; and cancellation of large gatherings.Community engagement to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions.Many activities targeted at containing the outbreak were undertaken in China as the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as city-wide lockdowns and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea conducted mass surveillance and forced quarantine at the base and issued a travel advisory for infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial support for those who have passed the test and imposed harsh penalties on those who have not complied.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and fines on medical supplies.The figures for the UK and the US show that containment (slowing but not stopping the spread of disease) and containment (reducing the growth of disease) are major challenges.
The best mitigation policies can reduce the maximum health care need by two thirds and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and the health system is suffering.
Active containment may be selected and necessary as long as the virus is circulating in humans (or until a vaccine is available if earlier) when transmission is rapidly ramping up when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have resulted in social and economic losses.
No specific antiviral drugs have yet been approved for use against COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including trials on existing drugs.
Excessive medication, drinking water, and rest may help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and assisted breathing may be necessary.
Steroid use can make the outcome worse.
Several components previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also states that some traditional and home remedies may provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The capacity building and adaptation of health care for the recovery of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as the primary response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO in Europe announced a shift of focus for hospitals and primary health care services to a multi-level resource shift, including a focus on experimental services for COVID-19 testing, eliminating screening processes, timely and feasible isolation and isolation of COVID-19 patients, and increasing capacity, intensive care by staffing, and increasing ventilation and air conditioning facilities.
There are various theories about where the first case (called the null case) may have originated.
The first known case of the new and distinct virus is likely to occur on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of Zika virus in Hubei increased steadily.
Most of these cases were linked to the Huanan seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory suggests that the virus came from a species of these animals, or that it may have been of animal origin.The pneumonia of unknown cause was traced on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 27 December.
On 30 December, a team of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of the SARS virus, similar to the coronavirus.
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was charged with disorderly conduct.
The Wuhan Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
Enough cases of unprecedented pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to set up an investigation in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled in about seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, triggered by the Chinese New Year holiday, and Wuhan is a major transportation and railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases per day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data showed that 6,174 people had started to show symptoms as of 20 January 2020.[108] As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy as the country with the most cases in the world.[109] As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died, and more than 364,000 people had recovered.[110]

On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
The director general said that WHO was "deeply concerned by both the scale and severity of the epidemic and the state of inaction".

In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for ordinary shoppers to sell domestic products to China.
This has created a shortage of milk, milk, and baby milk in supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan area, and the continuing high demand for food products, both regions have been left with severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the trade of illicit and illegal products have been successful, avoiding the expected shortages of food and alcohol in Europe as well as in North America.
In northern Italy, its key agricultural production has not declined much, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Food is running out of stores, even in Wuhan, as Chinese government officials have issued a pig ration to ensure food is available to the population.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely response of the central bank and the state.
The central bank has been more reactive than it was during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism suffered the most among other sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and government advisories against travel worldwide.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while regional British airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the yachting industry is at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with the festival of Jun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and local governments, including New Year's celebrations with private companies, as well as their own stores and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and in Shanghai.
New Year's events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and various traditional fairs.
Authorities in 24 of China's 31 provinces and cities have extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's gross domestic product and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has increased its response to the pandemic to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling all New Year celebrations.
Retail store visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of 5060%
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in foot traffic to the mall in March compared to February.
Supermarket operators around the world have put in place additional measures such as increased sanitation, the installation of heat scanners to check the temperature of shoppers and the cancellation of events.According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the crisis caused by the spread of the pandemic could have left between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America, more than in the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's rural migrant workers, numbering nearly 300 million, were either confined to their homes in mainland provinces or trapped in Hubei Province.As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans had lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could rise to 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Lockdown in India has caused ten million Indian migrant workers to lose their jobs (for which they receive daily allowances).A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced unemployment.About 900,000 workers in Spain have lost their jobs since the country introduced the home lockdown in mid-March 2020.
During mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million UK workers applied for universal credit schemes.Around half a million companies in Germany sent their employees to short-term government-sponsored schemes, known as Kurzarbeit.
Armenia's short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of the agency as well as its staff and freelancers worldwide.
Arts and cultural organizations have tried to advance their missions (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to communities, protect the safety of their staff and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and at all levels, museums, libraries, theatres, and other cultural institutions have been closed, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there has been a massive effort to provide services via digital platforms.The decline in the disease has been slow and rapid, with the recent cancellation of major cultural, sporting and social events such as concerts and exhibitions, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced turmoil. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week in Rome, which takes place in the last week of the Christmas season, has been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly parishioners live in homes instead of meeting together on Sundays. Some churches have provided services through radio, live Internet or television, while others have allowed worship to be conducted by truck.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome of its parish and cathedral, and St. Peter's Square, without the regulars of the cathedral, other dioceses have abolished the liturgy and public gatherings have been limited to the cathedral, the mosque, the synagogue and the Sikh shrine.
The Iranian Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and later the closure of shrines, while Saudi Arabia imposed a ban on foreign pilgrims entering the country as well as a ban on local people going to shrines in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak has delayed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July.The International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be rescheduled to after 2020, but no later than summer 2021.Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and the games have been postponed or cancelled.
The movement has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands suspending or cancelling concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also suspended performances.
Some artists have found ways to continue to produce and share work online as an alternative to live performance, such as online live performances or creating a festival on the website for artists to perform, share and showcase their work.
On the Internet, internet cartoons related to the coronavirus have been widely circulated, with many people enjoying the fun and to divert attention in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism has been noted towards Chinese and people of East Asian origin and towards people from countries with high infection in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, uncertainty and instability have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were confirmed from China) showed that there was a racial bias towards various Chinese communities around the world, who were either eligible to get the disease or to receive what was considered a punishment for their actions.
Some African countries have also been seen to express anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their local origin.
Support for Chinese people online and offline and for those in the affected areas.
With the spread of the outbreak to new countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience severe COVID-19 infections, have fallen into suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens in countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initiated registration campaigns to ban Chinese from entering their countries to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #forbidChinese to enterJapan is high on Twitter.
Chinese people, like other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported an increase in the rate of racist abuse as well as other violations.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus the "Chinese virus", a term that is considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Ukrainian protesters attack buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the western regions of India bordering China and students studying in major Indian cities have reportedly been harassed in connection with the outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese people have destroyed the nature and that's why God has taken revenge on them.
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese have been plagued by an epidemic where foreigners are labelled "foreigners" and branded as "waste".
Many paid-for newspapers have removed this requirement for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publications have made available scientific research related to the infectious disease.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on preprint sites such as bioRxiv.
Emerging infectious diseases - infections of emerging pathogens, often of an outbreak-grade or new transmission pattern

Laboratory tests for the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include those that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test is specific and is designed to detect only RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm infection or recent activity.
Serology can be used both for diagnosis and for population screening.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people with the disease, including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, to be reported.
The accuracy of the morbidity rate and the immunity level of the population can be determined through the results of this test.
Due to limited testing as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a significant variation in the number of tests done across the country.
This variation is also likely to have a significant impact on the reported case-fatality rate, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), tests can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasal swabs, nasal swabs, or urine samples.
Results are generally available within hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with pneumonia are only reliable in the first weeks of the disease.
The virus can then disappear back into the lungs as it travels to the lungs.
For those who have been tested for the virus in the second week, a swab may be taken from the deep respiratory tract, with a cardboard or a cough device.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020, using real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and has created a database of 250,000 units for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020; South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based treatment class of the SARS-CoV-2 device (PowerChek coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"This method looks for the ""E"" gene shared by all beta-CoVs and the RdRp gene specifically for SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic kit of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to its National Health Laboratories for biometric testing".
Genetic testing, one of three facilities in the older generation of tests, makes results uncertain due to errors and test complexity at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing with two components was not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was not until then that state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization for Commercial Laboratories.The commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Diagnostics of the search were established nationwide and COVID-19 testing services were available from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits were announced; sample collection and replication must be performed according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 disease test was developed and produced by the state-owned Institute of Biotechnology and Biological Detection VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Surveillance.On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours at maximum capacity, thus allowing a single machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing of Abbott's m2000 system.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR technology.
Since it does not require a continuous cycle of temperature cross-checks, this method can give a positive result in five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day.The test uses a monoclonal antibody specifically bound to the N-protein glycosylate of the emerging coronavirus in Taiwan, with the claim that it can give results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to rapid-fire tests.
" A March 2020 physical examination concluded that a chest X-ray is less valuable in early diagnosis, whereas a CT [scan of any area of the body] finding may be present even before symptoms appear. " "
Common features on CT include the sharpness of the double-blade mirror with the back split, the irregular body and the interfaces.
The excess volume under the lung, the inflamed lining and the aggregates evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to CT in Wuhan, the source of the current outbreak, showed that CT is more sensitive than PCR, with many of its features being more compatible with pneumonia and other pathological processes, though not specifically.
" In March 2020, the American Academy of Sciences recommended ""CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. "" In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial follow-up. ""
Part of the immune system's response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These may be used to induce individual infection starting 7 days or after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance.The testing may be done in a laboratory controlled-lot (CLT) or by focused point-of-contact (PoCT) testing.
High-throughput evolutionary automation systems in many epidemiological laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but the feasibility of these systems will depend on the rate of production for each system.
For single-cell imaging, CLT is often used instead of transfusion, although a follow-up image may be used to monitor immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by cutting the skin.
Unlike the PCR method, the extraction step is not required before the injection.On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 entities that provide the agency with on-demand notifications and can now distribute their own confirmatory tests.
On 7 April 2020, only the retinal test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.In late March 2020, the Euroimmun and Epitope medical laboratory diagnostics received European approval for their blood test, which can protect IgG and IgA antibodies against microbes in blood samples.
The test is capable of sampling in a matter of hours and is therefore faster than PCR detection of viral RNA.
Normally, the detection of the antibody is within 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were suitable for use.
" Hong Kong has developed a scheme whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "" the emergency department director will administer a swab to the patient, "" they will be sedated, then the swab will be returned, and a little later they will receive the test results.The British National Health Service (NHS) announced that they are piloting the scheme to test suspected cases at home, which could reduce the risk of transmission to others if they visit a hospital, or to have ambulances with a swab if necessary.In testing for COVID-19, the swab is used for cases where the healthcare provider has taken the most care. "
The driving center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Health Insurance Qualified Physician said on March 2 that it has the capacity for testing about 12,000 people a day in an ambulance facility and 10,700 were tested in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the institute's director Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, testing is available in some major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany is unknown, as only positive results are reported.
The initial laboratory survey showed that as of week 12/2020, a total of up to 483.295 samples had been tested, including week 12/2020 and 33.491 (6.9%) samples that had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Israeli Institute of Technology (Technion) and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients at the same time, working together to collect samples and further tests, but only in cases where the collected samples were found to be positive.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the computer-based case design process is 47% more expensive, while the cost of the isolation solution is doubled if the testing capabilities are not used.
The Wuhan lab was immediately followed by the Huangyan lab in Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 cities across China.
On 4 March 2020, the total number of tests was 50,000 per day.Source: Wikipedia Origami Assays, a test design developed by Origami Assays, was released, which tested samples of 1,122 patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These robust designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for automated object capture.
In March, the shortage and insufficient number of conversions became a barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to seek a sample preparation protocol involving heating the sample at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA gene for further testing.On 31 May, it was announced that Saudi Arabia is testing its population more for coronavirus in one country than in the other and is on track to expand the testing rate to reach the majority of the population.
" This is through a combination of lobbying and the purchase of a large laboratory from the population of 42 and BGI (based on their " Hu-Yuan " emergency laboratory in China). "
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to test tens of thousands of RT-PCRs per day and is the first in the world to operate outside of China.
Various test protocols that focus on different aspects of the viral genome have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization received a German patent for a manufacturing device sent to a low-income country with no resources to develop itself.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020.The protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control does not exist until 28 January, the extension of the testing period available in the United States and the United Kingdom has problems with the reliability of the testing equipment in the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia are unable to supply enough equipment to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
Instead, experts say South Korea's extensive testing has helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was developed over the years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has resulted in thousands of tests at private laboratories in the United States and the supply of disposable detergent and materials for chemistry testing has become strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in their test equipment.
"In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC was ""crisis-prone"". The government then blocked the diplomatic office that prevented private testing.Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect".
The company explained that the inaccurate results could be due to a failure to collect the sample or use the equipment correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.Eighty percent of the Czech Republic's test kits purchased from China gave incorrect results.Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test kits be thrown into the Danube.Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and "were not put into service".The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that these kits were unusable.
Follow-up testing with those who tested positive and follow-up with those who were contacted with SARS-CoV-2 positive was associated with a positive outcome.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on a total population of about 3400 people, isolated for about ten days.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases detected were isolated.
With this limited travel to the cell, new infections can be eliminated completely.
With strong contact tracing, restrictions on travel within the country, testing and quarantine, 2020 saw the global outbreak of the coronavirus in Singapore develop slower than in other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as forcing the closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled and Singapore began to introduce stay-at-home orders on 28 March, but schools reopened shortly after the holiday on 23 March.
Many other countries have managed the pandemic through strict contact, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less strict stay-at-home policies, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistically based studies have found that countries that test more are associated with lower mortality rates, possibly because these countries are better able to prevent symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries without testing capabilities and national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive COVID-19 samples and their first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for testing.
Of the 16 laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
" In the chart below, the "positive test percentage" ranking is influenced by the country's testing policy".
A country that tests only people who are admitted to hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, and the rest is the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing one's hands in order to remove dirt, grease, debris, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap at certain critical times of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, asthma and oral infections.
People can also get respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (for example, sneezing).
The five most important daily situations to wash hands with soap include before and after bathing, after cleaning a child's toilet or changing a child's diaper, before feeding a child, before eating, and before or after preparing food or preparing fish and poultry.
The World Health Organization recommends hand washing: We can wash our hands with a towel if we don't have water and soap.
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the napkins, the baby wipes, or the toiletries that have already been used.
After your nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching a predator or animal waste.
Theoretical hand hygiene focuses on the practice of hand hygiene, which is related to the instructional techniques of the teacher.
Hand washing before medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogenic agents (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemical substances that can cause harm or disease.
It is especially important for those who manage food or work in the medical field, but is also an important application for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the spread of infectious diseases; reducing respiratory tract infections.
and reduce the infant mortality rate at home birth.
A 2013 study showed that handwashing practices could slightly improve the digestibility of children under five years old.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and respiratory diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, comparable to providing clean water in low-income communities.
48% of the reduction in asthma can be attributed to hand washing with soap.Hand washing with soap is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent asthma and acute respiratory infections (ARI), which is a standard practice in schools and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Strep throat and pneumonia together cause almost 3.5 million child deaths every year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a habit can save more lives than any vaccination or medical intervention, cutting deaths from pneumonia by almost half and deaths from respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions that are part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs.
Hand washing can also protect against hand dermatitis, which is transmitted through direct contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition known as hand palsy, or hand dermatitis, common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of many of the same mental disorders.
The five key times a day that you need to wash your hands with soap are to reduce infection by contact with saliva and mouth: after using the toilet (walking on small and large feet), after washing the baby's tooth (moving the baby's diaper), before feeding the baby, after eating, and before or after preparing or cooking food, or touching meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing techniques should be practiced to prevent transmission include before and after treating a wound or bite; after chewing, coughing or rinsing your mouth; after touching animal waste or contact with animals; and after contact with feces.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is still low.
A 2015 study on handwashing conducted in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households practice handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%, the United States 77% and China the lowest rate of 23%.
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a diligent effort to promote children's health and education.
The twice-a-year disinfection, plus daily hand washing with toothpaste and flushed teeth, is a key feature of the national curriculum.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Exfoliation is the removal of the skin by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main function of soaps and disinfectants is to reduce the corrosion barrier and increase corrosion.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleansing agent because fats and proteins, the building blocks of soil organisms, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the strong current of water can help wash away the sink.
Because it's a solid soap, we can recycle it, and it has a good bacteria storage and soap after use.
A small number of studies that looked at bacterial transmission from soapy liquid have concluded that the transmission does not appear to be bacterial because it has already been washed away with soap dust.
"The CDC still says ""the juice in a can with a pinhead is better""".
They have been widely disseminated from anti-bacterial and anti-bacterial soaps to public health.
To date, there is no evidence that any recommended antibiotic or antibacterial treatment is selective for organisms that are resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain a common antibacterial agent such as triclosan, which has a volume volume that is equal to the maximum blood pressure of the body.
So if they don't select some antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the soap is not as effective as advertised.
In addition to the ingredients of the lotion, the antiperspirant and the skin protection agent, the formula contains acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, phenolic acid, bactericidal and skin-protective creams (such as anti-bacterial, vitamin, menthol and natural) A University of Oregon School of Public Health analysis claims that regular soap is as effective as chlorine-containing antibacterial soaps in preventing and killing bacterial pathogens on the hands.
Hot water that is safe for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are highly mobile at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water, such as soapy water, is more effective than cold water and soapy water in the purification of petroleum containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific studies, contrary to popular belief, have shown that using hot water is ineffective in reducing the amount of microbial debris on the hands.
Alcohol hand wash or hand sanitizer is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizer agents (known as alcohol handwash, hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropylene or ethanol alcohols formed by mixing a grease agent such as carbomer (a polymeric material of acrylic acid) into a gel or other substances such as glycerin into a solvent or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the toxic effect of the alcohol.
Adding a chemical component, hydrogen-peroxide, increases the disinfection activity.Hand wash water containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol is effective in disinfection.
Alcohol-treated water kills common bacteria, a wide variety of drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), some tuberculosis and viruses (including AIDS, RSV, influenza, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and yeast.
Alcohol-based handwashes, which contain 70% alcohol, kill 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (a reduction of 4 to 5 locks) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after use.
Alcohol handwashing is almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of hand infection.
The palms, the palms of the hands and between the fingertips are all rubbed for about 30 seconds until the material is swollen or dry.
The fingertips should also be washed, otherwise they will be washed with both hands.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with soapy water, especially when hands look dirty.
The rise in the use of these agents is based on ease of use and rapid anti-anxiety killing activity, but they should not replace proper hand washing unless there is soap and water.
Frequent hand washing can cause dry skin unless skin lotions and/or lotion are added to the formula.
The cleansing effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin-lightening agents to the formula.
In clinical trials, handwashes containing skin-lightening agents caused significantly less skin rash and dryness than soaps or antibacterial soaps.
Skin irritation from exposure to allergenic fish, allergic reaction to the smell of the fish, severe allergies, severe allergic reactions, or exposure to alcohol or additives in hand sanitizers are rare.
The rarely repeated practice of skin irritation caused by exposure to irritation has become a drawback compared to hand washing with soap and water.
In addition to its effectiveness, the non-aqueous agent cannot wash the delicate hands, but can kill the delicate hands simply.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many of the microorganisms that can cause infection, as the infectious agent remains on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on ingredients and formulas, and historically, alcohol-free hand sanitizers have been ineffective.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and incrementally increased antibacterial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated application, possibly due to an incrementally increased skin reaction.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and replace it with firewood or soil.
Washing with a cloth or a dirt may be more effective than washing with water, but it is not as effective as washing with soap.
One concern is that if soil or soil is contaminated with organisms, it could increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Soap is a disinfectant like soap, because when it comes in contact with water, it forms a sulfur-alkaline solution.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of clay or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques are recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent infections, which have the following stages:
Smoke with hot or cold water running.
It is recommended to use running water, as the reservoir may be leaky, while the temperature in the water does not seem to vary.
Rub soap bubbles on your hands, rubbing them with plenty of soap, including on your fingertips, between your thumbs and under your eyebrows.
Soap can remove bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that many people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when washing with soap than with water.
Wait at least 20 seconds.
Rinsing creates a glue that helps to remove germs from the skin, and rinsing for longer will help to remove germs more effectively.
A good swim in the water that is coming down.
Bathing in a bathtub (with or without running water) can rejuvenate your hands.
Dry your hands with a clean cloth or let it air dry.
The affected hands and arms are more susceptible to re-infection. The most common areas of injury are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and under the elbow.
Synthetic gums and anti-aging drugs can be a haven for the body's microorganisms.
A scented wash is often recommended to keep hands from drying out.Dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
Many low-cost alternatives can be made to facilitate handwashing in places where there is no water, mechanical and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a storm drain or a toilet with a suitable hose and/or using a fire if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are ecological solutions such as "tippy-taps" and other low-cost alternatives.
The shower is a simple technology using a shower tube held by a hose and a foot pad to apply a small amount of water to the hands and a hand soap.
Effective hand washing is an important part of the hand washing process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand washing in public restrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that toilet bowl is more hygienic than the hand dryers found in many restrooms.
In 2008, a study led by the University of Westminster, London and co-led by tissue engineering company European Tissue Symposium compared the levels of tissue in toilet paper to those in hand sanitizers and other modern hand sanitizers.
After washing and sanitizing the hands with a hand sanitizer, the total bacterial count was found to be increased on the palms, averaging 194% and on the hands 254%.
Drying with a hand sanitizer resulted in an average increase of the total number of bacteria on the palm of the hand by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total bacterial count was reduced on average on the hand pads by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.The scientists also performed tests to determine the potential for transmission of infection to other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each washing technique.
The washing machine, which blows air out of the machine at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h 400 mph) is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the washing machine and can cause noise to other bathroom users and the surrounding environment within 2 meters of the bathroom.
The use of a washing machine can spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the washing machine.
Toilet paper does not show any evidence of microdermabrasion. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwel evaluated the biology of several different hand sanitizers.
Observations of changes in bacterial counts after hand drying were found as follows:
Various washing machine manufacturers have emerged, and hand dryers have been compared to washing with a toilet paper.
Using hand sanitizer for hand washing is an option during our travels without enough soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing infection in the environment around hospitals.
There are electronic devices that give a reminder to hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget to do so.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Hand washing is a medical practice of at least 15 seconds using soap and water or a hand sanitizer in appropriate amounts to rub and wipe each part of the hand.
should be hand washed with respect.
You should use a scalpel to remove the scalpel under your wrist, if it is present.
It is important to wash your hands thoroughly and dry them with a clean cloth, as bacteria may remain in the water on your hands.
After washing your hands, use a toilet paper to block the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This is to avoid re-infection of the hands and surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health care settings is to disinfect the hands and prevent the transmission of infectious agents.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing deficiency remains at unacceptable levels in most medical facilities, with most doctors and nurses washing their hands before touching patients, leading to a lack of good communication.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood-borne infections associated with hemophilia by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a handbook recommending hand washing and hand-washing in health care.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene by the organization are also available on its website for public comment.
A retrospective review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and sanitize hands if the indication indicates the need to apply a general measure.
The World Health Organization has five categories for hand washing:
After contact with blood or body fluids
Before the job, disinfect and disinfect
After nursing a patient. the addition of a disinfecting chemical to the soap ("pesticide" or "bactericide") that can cause a disinfecting reaction in the hand sanitizer.
Such disinfection may be desired before surgery or in places where bacteria are highly resistant to antibiotics.So wash your hands during surgery by having a rubber open and closed, with no contact, using chlorhexidine or iodine hand sanitizer, clean towel for rinsing hands after washing, toilet paper, and disinfecting equipment for cleaning under the wrist.
All the ornaments should be removed.
This form requires washing hands and rubbing hands up to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A long pause (10 minutes) is not necessary.
They should prevent water from flowing back to the hands when bathing.
Wash your hands with a clean towel and dry them after washing your hands, and wear a surgical mask.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash or sanitize hands before and after caring for patients.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from handwashing was derived from the first 20 percent washing, and the very few additional benefits obtained from frequent handwashing were increased to over 35 percent.
Handwashing with plain soap still transmits three times more bacteria from food than handwashing with antibacterial soap.A comparison of handwashing with alcohol and handwashing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds also showed that handwashing with alcohol reduced infection by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than hand washing, disinfecting for the reduction of H1N1 influenza, virus and C. difficile infection from the hands.Meetings to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may involve educating staff about hand washing, hand washing with alcohol and a brief written and oral reminder to staff.
There is a need for more research into what interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, cost-effective means of achieving good health and good nutrition.
But the lack of a reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to achieve universal hand washing practices.
For example, handwashing facilities in most rural areas of Africa, close to private and public toilets, are scarce, despite the costly choice in handwashing facilities.
However, this low handwashing rate may be due to the lack of hand washing habits rather than the lack of water or soap.
The promotion and advocacy of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioral changes in people.
For this to work, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in promoting handwashing, but less so in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were ineffective.One example of promoting handwashing in schools was the "Three Key Steps" by UNICEF, which encouraged schools to implement simple and predictable steps to ensure that students washed their hands with soap, among other sanitation measures.
When the minimum standard is met, the school can move from a one-star rating to the highest three stars.
Building more hand washing facilities is part of the promotion of hand washing, which provides a reduction in infectious diseases and a reduction in child mortality.
The Global Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that is trying to achieve a change in behavior.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the adoption of handwashing symbols.
A small number of studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with DALYs.
But one review found that promoting hand washing with soap is actually less expensive than other sanitation and water interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, and especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand-washing anthropologists: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the English Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
At that time, most people still believed that infection was caused by bad smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne and healthcare-associated infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as a key means of preventing the spread of infection.
After the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, some countries realized that handwashing with soap was essential to protect themselves from infection.
For example, graphic boards with the words "Technical hand washing is correct" are hung next to hand washing in public toilets and in the bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands to get rid of something" means declaring not to take responsibility for something or sharing the complexity of it.
It originated from a biblical passage in the Gospel of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase of wider use in some Anglican communities.
The character of Mabed in the play begins to force her hand by attempting to clear the implications of the fantasy, which represents her guilt regarding the crime she committed and the urging of her husband to act.
They found that people, after remembering or committing immoral behavior, were more likely to think about washing their hands more often and to value hand sanitizer more highly.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such intentional practice are less likely to engage in "salt washing" or other purification activities than volunteers.
Some religions claim that hand washing is for anonymity and symbolic purposes. The symbolism of hand washing with water but not with soap is part of the specifics of hand washing in some Buddhist religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. All of these religions also affirm that hand washing is especially important after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims all wash their hands before and after eating.
Risk management in the workplace for COVID-19
Workplace risk management for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health procedures to risk management to prevent the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Workplace risk screening is based on workplace and occupational exposure risk assessments, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors for COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have little work contact with the public and other co-workers, are advised to use basic infection prevention measures, including hand hygiene, encourage workers to stay home if they are sick, monitor respiratory conditions, and maintain regular hygiene and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium risk occupations include those requiring frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who interact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated work environments, and some high-end retail outlets.
Risk management for this group is in addition to basic infection prevention measures, including ventilation using high-efficiency ventilation, a mask and personal protective equipment that can be used in case of contact with COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers healthcare and funeral workers known or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk if the worker performs procedures to create a rubber stamp or collects or handles samples from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Hazardous controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and appropriate personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak may affect some workplaces.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
The trade rate may change both in terms of what goods are demanded and the means of obtaining these goods (such as shopping at peak times or through a delivery or driver service).
Finally, cargo transportation from geographically severely affected areas of COVID-19 was suspended.The response plan and preparedness to the pandemic could be used to guide preventive actions.
Plan to address the level of risk associated with the job and various job duties, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and individual employee risk factors such as age or chronic health conditions.
They also outline the management needed to address those risks and the contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be the subject of national or sub-national recommendations.
Goals for responding to outbreaks include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk for adverse health effects, maintaining business operations, and reducing negative impacts to other entities in their supply chains.
The community is in a critical illness situation because businesses in the affected areas are responding.
Risk hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health for effective group risk management.
When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control and ultimate personal protective equipment.
Engineering management involves the removal of employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative management is the change of a policy or work procedure that requires action from employees or employers.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some risks.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk to personnel, fitted as appropriately as possible (e.g., respirators), worn securely and properly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored, or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have less workplace interaction with the public and other co-workers.
Recommended workplace prevention measures include frequent and frequent hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory symptoms including coughing and sneezing, providing mouthwash and sanitary pads, preparing for community contact or changing the veins if necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining a clean and sanitary work environment.
Identifying and quarantining susceptible individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness must stay home until they have a fever, fever symptoms, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using antipyretic or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of an unknown or suspected COVID-19 patient but may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community infection around the business location or because the employee had recently traveled internationally to a location with an outbreak of COVID-19.
These include staff who have contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments, high density populations, and some high-level COVID-19 sales restrictions. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency ventilation masks, increasing ventilation rates, increasing self-protection measures such as plastic sheeting, barricades, and window shields for customer service. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging employees to stay home. Instead of face-to-face contact, the newly developed Hands-On-Self-Controls, a new form of hands-On-Self-Control, requires that employees use personal protective equipment, including hand-on-hand training, face-to-face contact, hand-on-hand training, and other personal protective equipment, such as hand-on-hands, hand-eye training, hand-on-hand-on-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand, and hand-on-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand, hand-to-to-hand-hand-to-hand-hand-to-to-hand-hand-hand-to-hand, and hand-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-with, and hand-hand-to-hand-to-to-hand-to-to-hand-hand-to-to-hand-to-hand-hand-hand.
Personnel in this risk group are rarely required to use respirators.
If someone falls ill on a flight, proper screening to protect other staff and passengers includes isolating sick people from others by 6 feet, assigning a staff member to serve the patient and give the patient a pillow, or asking the patient to cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or contacting body fluids, and may have additional personal protective equipment if passengers have a fever, coughing, or shortness of breath.
Hands and other disposable items should be disposed of in the fuel tank, and the surfaces containing the sludge should be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial shipping, including cruise and other passenger ships, risk management includes delaying travel when sick and isolating oneself and alerting the medical centre on board as a matter of urgency if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical surveillance should occur in the quarantine rooms.For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person is on campus, regardless of the community spread.
When there is a minimal to average community delivery, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as avoiding field trips, conferences and other large gatherings such as sports or band classes or food in cafes, increasing the gap between tables, surprising arrivals and departures, limiting the number of unnecessary visitors, and using separate health facilities for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a lot of traffic in the base community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.For law enforcement personnel who perform daily activities immediately, the health is considered low risk by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must have contact with persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If interrupted during this stressful period, staff should clean and disinfect their wristbands and sanitary napkins before reusing them with a straw or towel, and follow standard operating procedures for the storage and disposal of used sanitary napkins and the storage and dust collection of clothing.
OSHA considers health care workers and some funeral homes to be high-risk, a type of exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include providing health care, support laboratory and medical delivery personnel who are identified as patients with suspected COVID-19 infection.
These become highly risky if staff perform procedures creating ventilation support or collect or handle samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Techniques to produce solid or liquid qualitative decomposition into metals include induction, coagulation, pulmonary imaging, and some dental or sample collection.
High-risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in the preparation of human remains that were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death. All of these items are at high risk if they undergo autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include separate containers for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, including when procedures are made to create devices where the particulate matter can be dispersed into the parts that are taken.
Specialized negative air pressure may be appropriate in some healthcare and funeral facilities.
Samples should be stored with caution according to biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated to different waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19.In addition, OSHA recommends the use of PPE for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients and those undergoing air-conditioning procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirator face coverings are used in the context of a wide range of respiratory protection programs, including physical therapy, exercise, and stress management.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve staff comfort.WHO does not recommend the wearing of masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks only for entry control personnel.
For those collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without a solid-liquid-gas separation procedure, WHO recommends the use of a mask, eye protection or face mask, a respirator and a hand mask.
The process of separating solid or liquid into a gas is implemented. The mask has been replaced by the N95 or FFP2 mask.
As the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear doors, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter rooms with COVID-19 patients, using only the PPE necessary for specific work, continuing to use the respirator without taking it out of the time to care for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and adjusting the PPE supply chain, and discouraging use for asymptomatic individuals.

In this month, we realize that we are in a very interesting situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear illustration of the interconnectedness of our humanity and our world and the responsibilities we have for each other.
We don't have a model for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of global understanding, collaboration and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The photography and attention we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, phone calls and conversations is a remarkable feat of the incredible people we are lucky enough to work with.
I have nothing more grateful and proud to have as my partners.
Last week, people came to me and said they appreciated our work.
They heard me talk about what it means for the world to be able to go back to Wikipedia now and what a powerful signal it is for this important resource to be online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep this site up, or our colleagues pay, or our community is safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it will impact the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role, we're going to make some adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Our work schedule and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C team met last night to discuss our strategy and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the appropriate response to what we were facing and how best to make the organization sustainable in the meantime.
Moreover, we want to reduce stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call back, no.
For all employees, employers and contracted employees:
Our daily workload is expected to be approximately 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We don't take days off - if you can work overtime, the mission may need you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to take care of your loved one, shop for groceries, or visit a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't keep track of your time.
If you are sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we are talking.
No sick days or PTO required - just inform your manager and help your team edit the logs and schedule to make sure the most important parts of the job are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan in T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide assistance and ensure that your condition is given proper attention by management.)
Many hours will be paid in full.
We have said before and we are committing again to honor our commitment to our employees and co-workers every hour.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal hours of work under normal conditions.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to release their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, this is your own care.
We ask that you contact your manager so that we can know what to expect and make adjustments accordingly.
A piece of work is considered essential.
There are some things we have to continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety, and Organic teams (among others) do important work that may require additional support.
We will begin working with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our attention to supporting what is necessary for our mission.
There is so much work to be done for all of us, we just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not plan to double-track once the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now unrealistic.
We will accept the changed circumstances and will set new targets and timelines that are appropriate.
What happened to the (annual plan) program?
To adjust to the new situation and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timing for our 2020-2021 annual planning.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, allowing more time for budgeting to allow staff to prioritize important tasks, self-care and caring for loved ones while accepting those in need or planning to cut back on over the next few weeks.
This delay greatly reduces the current planning workload and pressure across the entire unit.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and will update the executives and team at the next stage when we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this mission.
Office conditions, pollution, and cleanliness
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, we were very careful to hire virus cleaners to clean all the areas in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital antimicrobial solution to kill germs on all surfaces as well as in our waiting rooms and on our flight banks.
The building is using a collection of personal care products that support the safety of their guests.
We felt that the office would be well organized when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shares its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Just last week, our DC office moved to a remote location, in line with guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we've also been discussing the Brooklyn location.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our remote collaborators know that it can be a challenge and want to give you some tips:
Set the meeting to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer periods are required, consider how they can be spread over several days.
Clear meeting times, manners and materials for reading come first.
Create original video using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live streaming, collaboration and linking.
Lead to coordinate the meeting, someone to follow the discussion for questions and to keep track of the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make collaborative notes).
Email technical support if you need a hearing aid.
Health tips for snacks.
Join the #RemoteNetworking in Slack to chat with your coworkers about the work you've done.
The HR team is looking to the web-based technical guidance to support the growth of the fund's global distribution work.
Last week, we asked all community donors to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events such as editathons until WHO declares the outbreak over.
We let them know that we understood that our proposal for the removal and other restrictions would make it impossible to fulfill the agreed-upon grant activity and that no one would be penalized for the extension or modification of those targets.
Next week we will follow up with more guidelines on Wikimedia and community conferences and local topics.
The general public from around the world seem to be depressed and distracted, but thriving on clarity and the ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and others.
Moving forward, CRT is working to create a Meta-Wiki page to provide a place for the community to track impacts and track our interactions with them.
Please stay in touch around COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your resume for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share updates, answer your questions and spend some time in touch with each other.
We all have these problems and we are here to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email and other important COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all the information in one place.
We are working to maintain regular contact with staff living in the most affected countries at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, major events, insurance issues, or anything else you need help with, please feel free to contact and work with CRT.
We are here to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have a question or a problem, please email Bryan Judan, Global HR Director, Global HR.
None of these changes should be considered as abandoning our work and our responsibilities.
Rather, they are the recognition that our jobs and responsibilities are now likely to be served in ways that we have not been before.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support each other so we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and the world with the services they depend on.
Our scheduled work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create a platform for the important work that will come in the weeks and potentially months to come.
We need you all to make that happen, and so we need you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be at your best when you need to be.
Now, wash your hands and don't touch your face!

ACE2 is an enzyme that is bound to the outer membrane of the liver, blood vessels, heart, kidney, and intestine.
ACE2 antagonises the activity of the enzyme oxidase inhibitor (ACE) associated with reduction of oxidase-II and increase of Ang1-{7}), making it a successful drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cellular entry point for any number of coronaviruses.
The human enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Endocrine enzyme 2 is an iron-containing enzyme located on the surface of endocytes and other cells.
The ACE2 protein encodes an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal tricyclic acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I receptor protein, whose enzyme acts directly on the surface of liver cells and other cells.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transcriptional domain by another enzyme known as a transesteri, while the resulting degraded protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most tissues: ACE2 is bound to the cell wall of type II adult cells, liver, breast, small intestine, blood vessels, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels in most tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also present in the peripheral membrane of the striatum, the hypothalamus, and brain cells.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a balancing agent in response to ACE.
ACE cuts the hormone angiotensin I into the blood coagulation angiotensin II.
ACE2 decomposes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid from two angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and decomposes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also kill certain other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 helps to modulate the action of the amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is seen in Hartnup's disease.
Because of its transcriptional protein, ACE2 acts as a key entry point into cells for several infectious viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 is translocated into the ACE2 enzyme present on the cell surface, resulting from the differentiation and localization of the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located in the cell.
This induction process also requires the presence of essential S-protein via the TMPRSS2 protein in the liver, an inhibition that is being investigated as a potential therapeutic.This activity has led some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, some social and institutional experts still recommend continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and analysis study released on 11 July 2012 found that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% reduction in the incidence of pneumonia compared to non-users.
However, the risk of stroke was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of stroke, especially in stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with reduced mortality associated with pneumonia, although the effect is less pronounced than the risk of pneumonia in general.
The combination of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a highly effective treatment for liver disease, and it promotes better blood circulation in the lungs as well as oxygen saturation associated with lipopolysaccharide, which causes severe respiratory complications.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, and the onset of activity is 30 minutes plus a 24-hour effective period.
Several findings have suggested that rhACE2 class drugs may be a successful treatment for intolerance in patients with normal angiotensin-synthesis inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where the action of angiotensin-synthesis is increased.The introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory symptoms.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile app developed to help track contacts in response to the global spread of the coronavirus in 2019-20, for example, process identification of people who have come into contact with infected people.
Many applications have been proposed or made with the official support of some local governments and some agencies.
Several frameworks for creating exposure tracking software have been developed.
Concerns about privacy were raised, especially about systems based on tracking the geolocation of the app's users.
Options for less common interceptions include using Bluetooth signals to record the distance in proximity to another user's phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It has been rolled out in more than 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
" The software was developed by local open source technology communities and will be provided to the government.North Macedonia has deployed ""StopKorona!"", a Bluetooth application to track contacts with potential infected people and provide rapid response to health authorities. "
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the mobile app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government confirmed that contact tracing software was in development and would be rolled out in the coming weeks. Similar programs are planned in Ireland and France (""StopCovid"")".
Australia and New Zealand are considering using TraceTogether and Singapore's BlueTrace.Russia plans to deploy geo-blocking for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, where the app is designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of engineering security at the University of Cambridge, has listed the practical problems that can occur with software based systems, including false positives and inefficiencies, if the software is used by a small percentage of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of malicious or dangerous coronavirus apps, Apple has restricted the types of institutions that can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store, limiting it to only official or reputable institutions.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar measures.
Privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the impact of large-scale surveillance using coronavirus software, specifically whether surveillance infrastructure built to address the pandemic will be dismantled when the threat is no longer present.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The institutions have declared eight criteria for the government's project:
"Surveillance must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate""".
Continued monitoring and surveillance will be subject to a moratorium.
Data usage will be restricted for the purpose of COVID-19
Data security and anonymity are protected and shown to be protected based on evidence.
Digital surveillance will have to avoid bias and encounters.
Any sharing of data with third parties will be provided for in the law.
There must be safeguards against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to any abuse.
A meaningful participation from all relevant stakeholders will be required, including public health specialists and post-bankruptcy teams.The German Computer Club for Casualties (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued a checklist.
The Google/Apple plan to address the problem of intrusive surveillance by removing robots from their device's operating system when needed.
Some countries have used location-based network tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the surveillance network was approved for use.
Web-based solutions that are likely to use unanalyzed location data could have a significant impact on privacy.
However, not all systems with a central hub need to be linked to and contain any individual's location data. The system's passcode is designed to be used only by one central hub in communication (see below).
In South Korea, software-independent systems are used to implement exposure tracking.
Instead of using a mobile application, the system collects information from various sources, including mobile devices that track data and card transaction data, and combines this data to form a mobile message message sent to a person who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to inform about the breach, the government has also made the location public, which was allowed due to a major change in privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through apps and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Tracking private communications is a well-established concept, with major research studies dating back to 2013. As of 7 April 2020, several teams of experts have been working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) systems to record the distance to another user's handset.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort of central and technical methods, not a single protocol.Professional protocols include proximity tracking, which can store the privacy of the protocols (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the number of emergency contacts (TCN, fka contact event number, CEN), protocols with privacy-related and manual-telephone communication tracking (PACT) and others.
According to the protocol, no private information is leaked from the device itself, and all transmissions are done on the device.
A team at the MIT Media Lab has developed SafePaths, a software framework for using privacy-protected technologies when collecting and using location or traffic data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the official report "Malware: Privacy in the Spread of Misuse" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure computer technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by groups that have come together around what is essentially a common approach and mostly coordinated protocol, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and opening up the global interoperability of tracking and reminder programs, which is a key aspect of achieving universal acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace open source protocol used by official government software.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the operators of the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative for virus exposure tracking that they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy protection.
They also published the technical specifications of the technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be deployed in three phases:
There are government tools being deployed to develop coronavirus tracking software.
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google, and Apple plan to address the ongoing adoption and surveillance issues by first deploying the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in a timely fashion once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, drug re-purposing, or drug re-switching) is the authorized use of a drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition other than the one for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific study that is now taking a step forward to develop an effective and safe treatment for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of vaccines for COVID-19 and the introduction of plasma-containing SARS-CoV-2 proteins of approximately 66 types, each with multiple binding sites.
Analysis of the associated sites may provide a useful basis in the development of antigenic drugs for COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are proteins such as papain protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribophosphatase.

The COVID-19 vaccine b'A is a vaccine that is effective against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has been completed, several other trials are underway to develop such vaccines.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization said it did not expect a vaccine against the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large outbreak spread globally in 2020, leading to a lot of investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using the propagated genes to develop vaccines that can resist SARS-CoV-2.
The key actions of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development outlined in the April paper are speed, capacity, productivity, scale deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the major approaches reached in Phase I safety research include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developers of the first phase and experimental vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral factor (producer and first-stage vaccine experimenter: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus 5 Vector)
According to a report by CEPI scientists in April, 115 experimental vaccines are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as ongoing projects (79 vaccines, according to the Milken Institute), 37 more announced but little publicised (assuming that everything is in planning and development).
Phase I-II trials conduct safety and immunity testing, typically at random, controlled, and in multiple sites, while setting specific limits and efficacy.
Phase II trials require a large number of participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine to prevent disease while monitoring for optimal adverse effects.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates that are in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 candidates are not yet in human evaluation (in ""pre-clinical"" research)".

In March 2020, the three largest U.S. government, industry and university partnerships came together to use IBM's supercomputers along with the cloud-based data storage facilities of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have a genetic effect, or so-called adverse effects.
That means they could have a benefit over the disease they prevent.
A randomized study in Australia is enrolling 4,170 healthcare workers to the study.
Vaccines that could be developed would not be safe or effective.
Recent studies of vaccine efficacy in containing COVID-19 to ACE2-transgenic animals such as rodents, other laboratory animals, as well as non-human primates, all of which are for biosecurity level 3 in virus control and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in animal models, not humans.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of a vaccine or cure for SARS was the top priority of governments and public health agencies around the world.There is also no vaccine against MERS.
As MERS becomes more widespread, the available epidemiological research is believed to provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other phase I clinical trials are underway, all of them using a vector-based vaccine. Two are the adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is the immunoviral vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have revealed a conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been discovered and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents cited from social media posts provide information about existing patents for the sequencing of genes and vaccines for other coronaviruses, such as SARS coronavirus, among others.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, seizures, stomach pain, difficulty in identifying smells, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the first symptoms is about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and organ damage.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is mainly spread between people during close contact, often through small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
When these gases are produced, when exhaled, they usually fall to the ground or on the surface, rather than passing through from a distance.
People are infected by contact with the surface of the germ, which then touches their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, meaning infection can occur before the onset of symptoms or in the later stages of the disease.The standard diagnostic method is the time-constrained rRT-PCR (rhotic resonance transfer polymerasease chain reaction) counting of infection taken from nasal and anal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks in public are varied, with some authorities recommending against their own wearing, others recommending their use, and still others requiring their own use.
There is currently no vaccine or treatment with specific antivirals for COVID-19.
Local infections have been recorded in most countries across the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, weakness, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain or tension, confusion, difficulty breathing, and facial numbness or redness of the mouth.
Upper respiratory symptoms include coughing, nausea, or pain.
Symptoms of gastroenteritis, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed at varying rates.
A number of cases in China initially showed only chest and breast tenderness.
In some cases, the disease can progress to disease, inflammation, tissue damage, and death.
This is called the cooling off period.
The period of symptomatic COVID-19 after infection is usually five to six days, but it can also be between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will have the condition within 11.5 days of infection. The report suggests that not all infected people develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic groups in transmission is not yet known, however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and is being studied, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1 out of 166 infections that day, with 130 (78%) asymptomatic when tested.
Both the mouth and the nose can contain a large number of viruses.
Loud speech emits more water than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that constant coughing can cause water vapor to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Science Foundation has suggested that biogas transmission is possible, and collectors have placed the air in the halls outside the human room to create a positive sample for the viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the airway to become blocked, thus causing airborne transmission.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through the feces, the risk is believed to be low.The virus is contagious when a person is symptomatic, while the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) noted that while it is unclear how easily the disease spreads, it is common for one person to transmit it from two to three others.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for up to one day on cardboard, up to three days on polypropylene and inorganic steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% plastic.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and washing soaps are also effective if used correctly. Soap products reduce the virus's immune system, inactivating it, and cleansing skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (an antibiotic) were less effective.In the Hong Kong study, oral samples were taken on average two days after the start of admission.
Five of the six patients in the first sample tested positive for the virus had high viral counts, and the fifth patient tested positive on the second day of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory syndrome is similar to the acute respiratory syndrome of the novel coronavirus initially isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in viruses related to the coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which causes its protective membrane to explode. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The liver is the organ most affected by COVID-19 as the virus enters the cells of the liver via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is secreted by the second type of small air cells of the liver.
"This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter host cells".
Exposure to heart disease was found in 12% of those infected and hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and most were severe.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the inflammatory response and immune system problems during the progression of the disease, but cardiovascular injury can also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High rates of pulmonary embolism (31%) and pulmonary embolism (25%) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor prognosis.Cytostomies of people who died from COVID-19 showed alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammation of lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 requires the enzyme ACE2 present on the cells of the urinary tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms similar to those of a full-blown rash.
Specifically, the pathogen GM-CSF secreted T cells that have been shown to be involved in inflammation due to their association with IL-6 release from monocytes and severe liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte penetration has also been reported in a biopsy.
The World Health Organization has announced several ways to detect the virus.
The standard method of testing is real-time polymerase chain reaction (rT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on a sample of the respiratory tract obtained by a swab, however, a nasal sample or a throat sample may also be taken.
Results are usually seen within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these tests require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus and sequence its genome, so laboratories around the world could independently develop a polymerase chain reaction test to detect infection caused by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, the test for DNA (which can detect active infection and whether a person has been previously infected) is in development but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment with the test showed an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first-time clinical trial of the drug on March 21, 2020, for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines issued by the Wuhan University Medical Center outline methods of detecting infection based on the specificity of the treatment and the risk of infection.
The obstruction on the bilateral polygon with the distribution of the material, the uneven and back is common in the first pass.
Subpleural control of the hard surface (hardening of the lobular septal with permanent alveolar filling) and mixing may occur as the disease progresses.
There is very little data on the microbiome, morphology and pathogenology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the biopsy are:
What we can see is: pulmonary embolism, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.
Four types of viral pneumonia can be distinguished by their severity:
Mild pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, inflammation of the spinal cord, abnormal liver cell growth, internal inflammation with infiltration of fluid and formation of plaque.
Severe pulmonary embolism: Multiple pulmonary embolism with the addition of fluid from the pulmonary embolism.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: preparation of exudates in the alveolar ducts and chronic pneumonia
Blood: blood clots in the blood vessels (DIC) leukoerythroblastic reaction of the brain
Precautions to reduce the chance of infection include staying home, avoiding public spaces, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, practicing respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose, or mouth when hands are not washed.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and throat with a mouthwash when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the inside of the wrist if there is no mouthwash.
Proper hand washing after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public as part of a strategy to limit transmission from asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce exposure of infected people to crowds by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include keeping a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters) between people.
No drug is known to be effective in preventing COVID-19.As vaccines are not expected to be discovered until 2021, the main part of COVID-19 management is trying to reduce the maximum extent of the pandemic, known as the 'clampdown'.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are exposed to dirt, before swallowing, and after blowing a nose, coughing, or sneezing.
The WHO further recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.For areas without a hand sanitizer, the World Health Organization offers two formulas for on-site production.
All of these compounds have increased antimicrobial activity from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to kill bacteria in alcohol, but it is not an active hand sanitizer.
Glycerol is added as a preservative.
People are managed by supportive care, which may include chemotherapy, oxygenation and help to reach other major organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of having the virus wear a mask.
Extracorporeal ventricular oxygen uptake (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle as well as diet are recommended to improve the condition.
Post-infection therapy may be useful for those with mild symptoms of the first stage after infection.The World Health Organization, as well as China's National Health Commission, have issued guidelines on how to treat COVID-19 patients who are recovering in hospital.
Emergency medical technicians and pulmonary disease specialists in the United States have been trying to bundle treatment recommendations from various agencies into a database that can access the IBCC's free files.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for initial use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when operating equipment that can be ventilated, such as ventilators or hand sanitizers.
Health experts are concerned about the safety of people with COVID-19 infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that patients be placed in isolation rooms to prevent airborne infection (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, exposure precautions and airborne infection precautions.The CDC has also issued recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: personal protective equipment, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be used as a priority (instead of masks).
N95 masks are approved for industrial use, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against any specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-official use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks, or at least hand-held masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are mild, requiring the use of a respirator, but a small percentage of cases require one.
A form of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory problems is being actively studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence suggesting that ventilation can be avoided by high-level bronchial ventilation or bi-level positive airway pressure therapy.
Whether these lead to the same benefits for people with chronic illness is unknown.
Some physicians prefer to stay with a ventilation system that is as ventilated as possible, as this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to a high-flow cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have adequate hospital beds, limiting the ability of health systems to cope with the sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring adequate hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required medical assistance of ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of the population in hospitals with recent COVID-19 cases were admitted to the ICU.
The mechanical ventilator is even more complex as respiratory respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has progressed in COVID-19 and oxygenation has become more difficult.
A ventilator with the ability to control the form, pressure and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of lung injury and pulmonary artery disease.
High-level PEEP may not be available on older wind turbines.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The broad-spectrum antiviral Remdesivir appears to provide the most success.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on people with severe illness.
The World Health Organization has recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of the treatment.The FDA has provisionally authorized the use of blood serum as a test treatment in some cases where patients are at risk of severe and fatal disease.
It has not undergone the clinical studies needed to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to address the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
" The app can detect ""close contacts"" using surveillance data and thus predict the risk of infection. "
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only advises the self-testing practitioner, but also notifies local health officials.Big data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and virtual commands are used to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of carrying the virus.
Measures have been taken to strengthen quarantine and protect all those who have come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared mobile location data with German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and contain the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed advanced technology to detect the perpetrators of the attack.
Giulio Gallera, the regional health officer in Italy, said he had received a notification via the mobile phone company that "40% of the population is still on normal routes".
The German government has set up a 48-hour hackathon on weekends with an estimated attendance of over 42,000 people.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience severe stress from illness, travel restrictions, treatment effects, or fear of infection.
" The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying that ""the rise of social isolation, isolation, health care, stress and economic decline are a major storm in endangering people's mental health and well-being""".
The disease can be mild, with few or no symptoms, or similar to other common upper respiratory tract diseases such as the common flu.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are lacking.For some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In those who are most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes bacterial bronchopneumonia or organ damage.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include blood microorganism disease, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
An abnormal clotting, especially an increase in prothrombin time, was described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (infection).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the first case study, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In the National Health Commission (NHC) study of China, males had a mortality rate of 2.8% and females had a mortality rate of 1.7%
A postmortem examination of the lung tissue revealed alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cells exudating in both lungs.
Viral mutations have been observed in liver cells.
The presence of a lung is a symptom of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart failure, were characterized by elevated levels of the substance boronine or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations are pre-hospital.The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of a region can also affect mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality from the disease vary because of regional differences, but also because of the complexity of the methodology.
The exclusion of mild cases may result in a misdiagnosis of mortality.
But the fact that the deaths were the result of previously reported cases may mean that the current mortality rate is overestimated.
Smokers are up to 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decline in liver health in some people who recovered from the disease from 20% to 30%, and liver scans showed organ damage.
It can cause a series of symptoms after severe treatment, after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether past infection provides effective and long-term immunity to those who have recovered from the disease.
The immune system is thought to be adapted to the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, recovery from COVID-19 is by a positive test for the coronavirus at a later time.
These cases are believed to be more of a progression of infection that lasts longer than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be naturally occurring and to have originated from animals through infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but in December 2019 there was an outbreak of contagion, which prompted a human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 initial cases of COVID-19 infection, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, suggested the first day of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The official publication of the World Health Organization reported the onset of the earliest symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Some measures are often used to confirm the death toll.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the World Health Organization assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code number U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinical or pandemic deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed individuals who died from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), reflecting the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case management.
While not all infected people generate antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnivals and to younger people, resulting in a low mortality rate, and not all deaths from COVID-19 can be officially classified.
Furthermore, the German healthcare system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies to protect the body when evaluated by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were claimed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The death rate is higher for men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at age 50, with a male-to-female ratio of just 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Differences in sexual immune systems, the decreased prevalence of smoking in women, and in men with a progression of similar conditions such as hypertension occurring at a younger age than women may all contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women and they are highly susceptible to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is COVID-19.
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified, December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or human group, in accordance with international conventions for naming that focus on preventing infection.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the COVID-19 and virus that causes COVID-19 in public communication.
"Both the disease and the virus are commonly called 'coronavirus.'"
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and hwan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCov virus and respiratory illness, 2019-nCoV, as the provisional name for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidelines against the use of the name of the disease and the name of the pathogen.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital companies are producing healthcare products such as nasal swabs and ventilation units.
In one example, when an Italian hospital required emergency ventilation and the supplier could not deliver the required ventilation in time, a new local company developed rear-engineered products and produced the 100 ventilation units needed in one night.
In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak, a flurry of false information about the origin, prevention, treatment and general condition of the disease was disseminated across the Internet.
Humans appear to be capable of making the virus more transmissible to some animals.
Studies have found no evidence of transmission in pigs, chickens and chickens.
There is no recognized drug or vaccine for treating the disease.
International research into vaccines for the treatment of COVID-19 is being led by governments, organizations, academics and researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated a collaborative trial to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing antiviral drugs and identify the most effective compounds.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccines.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV were reused because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can enter human cells through the ACE2 receptor.
There are three vaccine trials.
Initially, the researchers aimed to develop a vaccine that is fully resistant to the virus.
The use of such viruses, whether inactivated or not, is intended to stimulate the body's immune response to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that stimulate immunity to certain parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2+, such research focuses on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines derived from one of these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first vaccine trial began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code from the virus that causes the disease.The enhancement of antigen dependence has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for cancer, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or glucuronine.
The re-designed antiviral drugs are largely helping Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of Remdesivir underway in several countries due to report in late April.
A systematic review of clinical evolution for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates has been launched and is available as of April 2020.A number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19: Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir in combination with Interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir as of March 2020.
Improvement in disease progression was observed in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which is used to treat measles, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
But there are calls for a review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends only a single dose, and taking two doses can be dangerous and even fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued a notice to allow the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on a doctor's recommendation in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. China's 7th notice also allowed the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials.
Nitazoxanide was proposed for further study after a low-level SARS-CoV-2 inhibition was found.Other studies showed that it has a protein-mediated serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) expression that is required for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells via the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to be used with or without azithromycin are problematic due to the Medical Association's caution that these treatments should be used without study.Oseltamivir does not stop SARS-CoV-2 and has no role in treating COVID-19.
This increase in cytokine production may be a consequence of the late stage of severe COVID-19 infection.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the growth of cytokine cells.Tocilizumab was also approved for clinical use, according to the National Health Commission of China, after a small study was completed.
It is in phase 2 of randomized trials at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illnesses.
In combination with serum ferritin testing to identify Cytokine Storms, it is meant to counter such mutations, which are considered to be the cause of death in some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 replacement therapy was approved by the FDA based on a subsequent case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release caused by estrogen, which was caused by various causes, including CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring the burned and collected antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it is being considered as a method of immunization without the use of vaccines.
This strategy was tested for SARS with uncertain results.
Bacterial immunization is the mechanism of action by which treatment with passive antibodies can facilitate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cytokines, cell-based antigen and/or phagocytes.
For example, other forms of anaerobic digestion therapy using engineered monoclonal dialysis are in development.
The production of serum for recovering patients, which contains blood from those who have recovered from the virus, is a form of resistance to the virus itself that is just beginning to emerge.
Coronavirus is a group of closely related symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after he publicized the spread of the virus.
