Last month, the presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martli's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
Occasional violent protests are triggered by the absence of elections, some since 2011.

The number of people who voted against becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008, from 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Queen Elizabeth II should have declared Australia a republic by the end of her reign.
34 percent of the polling station share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last queen of Australia.
At the peak of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.

NextGen, a system the FAA claims allows an aircraft to save a million gallons of fuel a year and make short trips to reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike previous ground-based radar technology, air traffic controllers use satellite-based technology to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No more travel is increasing and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking facilities will not be available on the ground.
fears of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the match would be forced to take place behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
researchers at princeton university in the united states and upsala university in sweden report that the new species was created in just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take longer due to breeding between the rare darwin finch, geospitsa fortress, and the rare cactus finch, geospitsa conyrostris.
gold can be made into all kinds of shapes. it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be bent and twisted into a thin wire. It can be crushed or rolled into a regular shape.
It was so thin that it could be used to adorn hand-drawn illustrations in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called a chemical pH. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH of a test chemical indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH).
hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (so hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron).
mix the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will clash with the outer layers, which will make it feel funny and creates a kind of shell.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro have flash toilets in every home connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in homes in the Greek cities of Minoan, Crete and Santorini.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a common room.
when you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was launched into space by rocket. Because the earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and visibility, researchers use telescopes in space.
a giant rocket more than 100 feet high is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The greatest thing it has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
At their base are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized animals, from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including larger domestic cats) that eat a huge number of small animals, such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
the secret of their success is field theory, a unique task that keeps each cat from competing with the others.
lions are very social cats, living in large groups called herds.
lion herds consist of one to three young males, up to thirty females, and a pack of lions.
The females are often very close to each other, many of them are families of sisters and daughters.
lion cubs are very dangerous to wolves or dogs, animals such as lions (but not other large cats), and their rescuers.
The tiger is a well-rounded athlete, able to climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The leopard is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar (genus pantra). Only these four cats can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not a full-throated roar like a lion, but more like a phrase roar and a roar of words.
They will eat monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals rescued by ocelots are much smaller than they are.
Scientists find ocelots/desert cats following their scent-feeding animals as they blow to their home on earth.
They can see well at night and move about well. They find prey by matching their environment.
Small organisms (small populations) often find themselves in a different environment from the main population from which they came (e.g. crossing a mountainous area or crossing a river or traveling to a new island from which they cannot easily return).
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new species needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original species has never changed, they still want the same optimization as before.
over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, their similarities with other populations diminish.
finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two peoples are so different in appearance that they are no longer the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the production of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they also take in the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., that which is exhaled).
plants absorb sunlight to prepare their food. they provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plant-based.
mosasaurus was the best hunter of his day, so he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
The long-tailed bats were armed with over 70 razor-like teeth and carried an extra set on the roof of their mouths, meaning there was no escape for anyone crossing their path.
We don't know for sure, but it had a forked tongue. Its diet included mice, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly its own offspring.
It would attack anything that went into the water, even giant dinosaurs like T. rex.
Although we know most of their food, the Romans had strange or unusual foods for feasting, including wild boar, tows, antlers, and the dormaeus
another difference is that the poor and women enjoy a big party where they sit on the couch and eat, while the rich enjoy their meals on the side.
the ancient romans' diet was not able to incorporate foods that were imported from the americas or asia to europe in later centuries.
for example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient romean had ever tasted turkey chicken.
the babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of their gods.
people made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' wishes through ceremonies and festivals.
each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner temple that only the priests could enter.
sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the sanctuaries.
the top of the wall was a special temple to his god.
in the hot climate of the middle east, a home was not very important.
most hebrew families lived outside the home.
Women cooked in the courtyard, and shops were open tables facing the street.
there were no large forests in the land of canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was scattered and settled. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while travelling westward, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
but regardless of his discovery, the eskimo tribes lived there at the time.
although each country was scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of denmark, sweden, norway, and iceland.
you might think that the national treasure movie is a treasure map written on the back of the declaration of independence.
However, that is not true. Despite what it says on the back of the document, this is not a map of the resources.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read "The first day of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776". The text is copied at the bottom of the document.
early in his life, he was riddled with the largest parchment document (293‚ÅÑ4 inches by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) to keep it together, though no one knows for sure who wrote it.
Therefore, the note may have been added as a tag only.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, however, the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion dubbed Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, the americans and free french forces had liberated southern france and were returning to germany.
civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people, a community, who live and work together.
civilization comes from civilis, which means civil, from latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city government, which in a way describes the size of a society.
The culture of civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
minority cultures often disappear without leaving valuable historical evidence and are not recognized as a formal civilization.
During the Civil War, the Thirteen Colonies initially formed a weak central government - meaning that Congress became their sole body - under the Articles of Confederation.
the council had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or court, it often relied on uncooperative state leaders to enforce all its laws.
nor did it have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles require a single consent from all the states before they are passed and the states have largely remained representatives because they did not properly take over the central government.
The Italy national football team is the most successful team in the world, following the German national team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sabre, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
While Italians compete in the International Games and the Olympics, winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan consists of some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often called "the archipelago" in geographical terms because of its group of islands
Taiwan began in the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island, as they passed through.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a foundation in southern Taiwan, initiating a change in the native grain management practices of the natives and hiring Chinese day laborers to work in its sugar and rice factories.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the first sino-japanese war (1894-1895) in 1895, the qing government signed the treaty of shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over taiwan to japan, which controlled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, known as the enthwatana, the temple of the sun, and the three-mirrored room.
to give tourists a better understanding of how the complex first came to be, most of the buildings have been reconstructed.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and reconstruction work continues.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but its focus has been replaced by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format was actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to get the simplest total number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) have an aspect ratio equal to or very close to this.
The third-party rule of the stutterer and laugher is a simple guide to creating flexibility while maintaining a certain level of image.
The most effective location for the main case is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image upward and vertically into three (see example).
the rich and powerful catholic church came under scrutiny during this period in european history.
for over a thousand years, christianity united european empires despite their differences in language and culture.
his destructive power is felt by all, from the youngest to the oldest.
one of the basic tenets of christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's fund of funds is set aside for that purpose.
the central authority of the church has been in rome for over a thousand years, and this accumulation of power and money has led many to question whether its basic guiding beliefs are being fulfilled.
soon after the battle, britain began to blockade the german navy.
Although the embargo violated generally accepted international law, which has been codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries, the strategy has been effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies.
Britain bombed international bodies of water to prevent any ships from passing through large bodies of water, posing a danger even to neutral shipping.
Germany had only a partial answer to the riddle, and so it expected the same for unrestricted submarine warfare.
in the 1920s, the dominant attitude of many citizens and countries was anti-war and isolationism.
after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of world war i, nations wanted to prevent a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with Edison's company in New York City.
he entered the united states with 4 coins in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of thanks to thomas edison from charles bachelor (his former supervisor).
ancient china had a unique way of defining different periods of time, with each of the ruling families or dynasties of china having a distinct dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
during these times, a fierce battle was fought between many princes vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was a bloody period in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people fighting and dying for the highest seat in the Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from reality to publicity, nationalism and the fact that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
and post-revolutionary careers that were highly sought after and successful were open to all male applicants.
the same is true for the army, because the ranking of the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
the french revolution inspired the oppressed working class of many other countries to start their own revolts.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the ordinary life. He regularly went to a cave called the Cave of the Light on Mount Xanur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which survives from his time, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
the cave was completely isolated from the outside world, because it was perched on a hilltop north of mecca.
In fact, it's never easy to find one even if one knows it exists. Once one enters the cave, it's total isolation.
The only thing visible from many of the mountains is the clear, beautiful sky around them.
the great pyramid of giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
The great pyramid, built by the egyptians in the third century bce, is one of several large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor pharaoh khushu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and families of the khushu.
The upper cut off symbol looks like a V and the lower cut off symbol looks like a stapler wire or a square with a missing bottom.
up means that you push the arrow, starting at the tip, and down means that you start at the tip (where your hand holds the arrow) and pull the arrow.
The upper-pitch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower-pitch is stronger and more calming.
You can mark your own results with a pencil, but the printed Boeing markings are for musical purposes and must be respected.
The shocked King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of angry shopgirls.
The king and queen were returned to paris surrounded by a mob of shouting and threats.
The crowd gathered for the riot forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriage.
on one occasion, a member of the crowd was beating the head of the executed royal guard at versailles in front of the terrified queen.
U.S. imperialism has paid the cost of the war to the people of the Philippines.
The government of the Philippines has agreed to pay U.S. purchasing power through Wall Street banks on airfares and bond interest.
Indeed, the vast majority of the Filipino population is a source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the templars, one must understand the background to their formation.
The period of time when the events took place is known as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, ending in the Common Era.
A strong sense of commitment to technology that includes a range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or the need for technology to the fundamental logic of human destiny, which is based on scientific laws and the emergence of technology.
most definitions of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological progress itself goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an impact on the societies it creates rather than the social conditions.
For example, a motor vehicle can be said to necessarily lead to road development.
But the national road network for small cars is not economically viable, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
owning multiple cars also increases the risk of road accidents, leading to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged parts.
Romanticism was a major part of the cultural commitment derived from writers such as Goethe, Fuchs and Schugel.
In the context of romanticism, geography was better suited to portraying individuals and, later, to creating arbitrary rules that fit the culture and location of the society associated with geography.
just as paris was the fashion capital of the modern world, constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal europe.
The reputation of being a luxury center began around 400 A.D. and lasted until 1100 A.D.
in the twelfth century, the situation deteriorated as warriors, mostly christians, returned from the byzantine market with gifts of greater value than the wool and spices they could offer.
that's when the title of fashion capital was transferred from constantinople to paris.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
at first, the robe had a profound influence on byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slowing communication routes, lifestyles in the West can be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europeans had developed their own style of dress. One of the great developments of the wartime was the use of locks.
sustainable agriculture is when the farmer has a crop that can only benefit him and his family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic, system of using seeds that are native to the ecosystem to increase yield by driving crops or combining them with other relatively simple techniques.
historically, most farmers have been engaged in hand-to-mouth farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social hierarchies and develop a sense of identity.
The internal cultures of members may vary according to age, nationality, class, location, and/or gender.
the features that make a subculture unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership in a distinctive and symbolic writing style that includes fashion, style, and slang.
one of the most common ways we use to explain the importance of social life is by looking at babies who have grown up in bad circumstances, abuse, or misery, and who have not been taught to live with their foster parents.
Some children are abandoned by others (often their own parents), in some cases because the parents do not accept their child's serious mental or physical disability.
abandoned children may have suffered severe child abuse or emotional distress before they came to or fled.
others are thought to have been bred by animals, some reportedly living alone in the forest.
When fully grown non-human animals, the wild child exhibits fully animal-like characteristics (e.g., fear or indifference to humans).
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
scaffolding is not a method of learning, but a support tool for individuals who are starting a new learning process, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Summaries can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a way of summarizing, like a little person folding a piece of paper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are contained in the software and are intended to query, analyze, and explain processes that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect, violence, and even theft.
no child should grow up in an environment without care, care, and instruction, but they will grow up.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
It is expected that the caregiver will provide all the necessary supplies that were missing from the previous home.
The internet combines the features of openness and two-person communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction approach.
For example, learning and socialization have been cited as important drivers for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Furthermore, "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new motivational factors when Ighme and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites.
video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of tiny expressions, facial expressions, and gestures that last for a few milliseconds.
in particular, it is believed that a person can prove that a person is not lying by correctly interpreting small statements.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay, The President's Speech, shows how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
he said that such human senses could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
twentieth-century research suggests that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the defined pool of variation.
The difference between the two pools is the difference in the separation and reintegration of the pools with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for organisms with digestive systems similar to humans to meet their amino acid needs from plant food sources there.
Failure to do so also has serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources could have been proteins in leaves and seeds, but these are difficult for mammals like us to digest unless they are mature.
animal foods (ants, ants, eggs) are more easily digested and provide a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors somehow managed to solve their protein problem, as chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Interrupted sleep is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
this can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without you being fully awake.
If you see yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed opposite the room to get you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorite-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed, forcing a person to urinate.
inner peace is inversely related to the level of stress in a person's body and spirit.
The less stress, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone has access to knowledge. The only thing standing in the way is our own anxiety and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but extends many techniques from the Mahayana path of love and Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. Kundalini yoga, incantation and an all-encompassing journey of love are involved.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (the power of awareness) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visions.
The Tibetan meditation center is a divine yoga. Through the inspiration of various gods, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are moved, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, forming an alliance between the USSR and the United States. When the war ended, conflicts of order, process, and culture led to the country's collapse.
two years before the war ended, the cold war began when the former allies became enemies.
it would last for the next 40 years and be fought in the real world on battlefields from africa to asia, afghanistan, cuba and many other places.
On september 17, 1939, polish defences were broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize with the roman army.
However, these plans were overshadowed overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded the eastern regions of Poland and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Anti-Terrorism Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
ships are the most efficient and effective means of transporting large numbers of people and goods by sea.
The usual task of the Navy is to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move people and goods and thereby disrupt your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One recent example of this to be documented was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and goods across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
if the allies had fallen, germany would have captured the rest of europe, and possibly britain.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to expect milk, hair, meat and skins to be provided to them easily.
Domesticated goats are usually kept in herds that roam the mountains or other pastures, often as infants or adult identical to the known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
wagonways were built in england in the early 16th century.
Although the chariots only included parallel stairways, they were designed to pull horses to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly more difficult roads of the day.
The crossbars were introduced early on to keep the tracks in place. But it was gradually realized that tracks with metal on top would be more effective.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In 1767, the first all-metal railways were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, which began with the emergence of Homo erectus (straight man) two million years ago.
the first, australopithecus, did not walk straight as usual.
Bipedal evolution was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelianthropods may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become advocates to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is often a symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not looking for temporary solutions, we must find the root causes of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of man, and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and overpopulation of the human lifestyle.
After being approved by congress on july 4, a handwritten draft signed by congress president john hancock and secretary charles thompson was sent to the press a few lines away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies of what is now called the Dunlap Broad Sides were made.
The first public reading of the document was on july 8 at john nixon's liberty hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. The copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Highways that have been identified so far are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Today, many fossilists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
many people don't think of dinosaurs as they have feathers and can fly.
but there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with teeth and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-rex.
Today, almost all computers are based on a string of information encoded in binary numbers.
binary numbers have only one or two digits, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer language.
Internal toxicity is not immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that they cannot be quickly diagnosed.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the article for any special first aid orders for that particular poison.
the word worm is a name used informally by the group of insectologists.
the word comes from the ancient spider, an insect that was highly adapted to live in close proximity to humans.
Both reptile-worms and bed bugs are sheltered, adapted to nesting or living in their natural habitat.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurodegenerative disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop ms as men.
Couples may decide that raising a child is not in their interest or that it is not in the child's interest.
the couple may decide to adopt their child.
In adoption, parents waive parental rights so that another couple can raise the children.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by means of the scientific method. This method actually leads to the most scientific research.
but not alone, experiment, and experimentation is a test used to avoid one or more problems, ask questions, and conduct observations that lead to scientific research.
naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical writings, especially the latin bible.
Aristotle's views are accepted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As greek knowledge declined, westerners became alienated from their philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed processes in physiology and behavior are often determined primarily by the existence of natural cycles and their productivity on biological clocks.
Seasonal affections that do not respond readily to external seasonal signals have been reported in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-supporting oscillators, which continue to cycle freeride even when there are no external signals.
the hersh and chase experiment was one of the themes of the theory that dna was genetic material.
harshi and chase used a virus to insert their own dna into bacteria.
They did two experiments marking the DAF with radioactive phosphorus or the protein F with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and the lineage of the affected cells.
only mutations in cells with germline can be passed on to infants, while mutations in other cells cause the cell to die or develop cancer.
nature-based tourism is a form of tourism that encourages people to visit natural areas to enjoy plants and animals, including wildlife.
Examples of activities carried out on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, learning about, visiting and photographing orangutans in Borneo.
people drive to work every morning from small rural towns and pass by where others have left their workplaces.
In this dynamic transportation fleet, everyone is somehow connected and supports a private car-based transportation system.
science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has reawakened the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality and collapsing bridges are sometimes heard equally.
Why do transportation systems bring such complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it simply that transportation engineers are not qualified? or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within a reasonably consistent range, so traffic flows have some reasonably consistent and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These connections help in planning, designing and operating road infrastructure.
insects were the first animals to fly. their ability to fly made it easier to escape predators and to find food and mates efficiently.
most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings by turning their bodies back.
this gives them a wide range of small areas to hide from predators.
today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are water fleas and mayflies.
thousands of years ago, aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the sun.

Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, all of which can be found in nature and are easy to mine with ancient tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the idea that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but it is suggested that they are transformed into new elements to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.

current theories focus on finding what attracts people.
these theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are built into them as they grow into adulthood.
these theories describe what makes certain people want what they do and what causes their environment to make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the Maslow hierarchy of benefits theory and Hertzberg's binomial theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to lead their former peers, two behaviors can arise: one is to try to remain one of the guys.
This type of supervisor has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end, a person changes to an unknown individual who feels the need to change everything the group has been doing and do their own.
in any case, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
this behavior often causes friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups are held to the same advanced levels as conventional groups, but have subtle differences.
virtual team members serve as a point of contact for their close physical team.
They are more often self-managed than normal team members and interact in different time zones that local managers cannot understand.
The existence of a real X-ray cluster is also a feature of the virtual cluster (Larsen and LaFastow, 1989, p109).

Before an organization can be creative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), describes a continuous methodology used to help organizations achieve high performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive testing. It thus narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
the link between brain disease and behavior is a useful tool for researchers.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, emotional wounds, scars, and internal inflammations affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
the advent of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes in ways never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build signaling models that help us understand processes in our brains.
Although AI has a strong focus on science fiction, AI is an important part of computer science that studies behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer inquiries and queries, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate systems, focused on solving real-life problems.
artificial intelligence is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been incorporated into many home computers and video game applications.
field trips are a key part of any class. Often, the teacher chooses to take her students to places where they cannot travel by bus.
Technology provides the solution from a virtual field trip. Students can view museum artifacts, visit their aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences for future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their annual trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but the existing versions remain online as a reference.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with a distorted grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often a very important audience, the blogger will begin to work on improving the articles to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them. The need to feed the audience's needs motivates students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to improve their learning beyond the normal school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "encourages students to be analysts and strong critics; students can express their views on other publications and their own views on specific issues by actively responding to online educational materials" (Oravec 2002).
