It's a wonderful ear.
The first place was won by the project "Safe headphones" - an innovative headphone by Dastan Aitbai from Kyzylorda.
He was awarded a special diploma and a certificate of 300 thousand tenge .
The earpiece of Dastan is a truly innovative project.
We know that young people today are connected to their smartphones.
The children and young people who had their cell phones wired to their ears and had earphones on, were left to listen to the music on the other end of the phone, and the car came and stopped them.
There are teenagers who are going through the blocks that are not allowed, and they are going to get into accidents.
The inventor, Dastan, admitted that he had never listened to the elders.
The earpiece, which was invented by Tasan, has a safety alarm inside.
When the car, traffic officials, ambulance cars, etc. start to play, the music in the headphones stops.
The sound of approaching cars is detected and the danger is signalled by stopping the music.
The head of the Kyzylorda State University named after Koryutta suggested to prepare such devices to prevent the danger.
The project of Dastan was awarded the first place.
The second place was shared by the "Journal business idea" of Chinggishan Sadov from Kyzylorda and the project "Healing center" of Umirzak Esbolatov from Sirdarya district .
The third place was awarded to the Chilean Gulnur Uderbayeva, the winner of the "Silk Workshop" project, and the author of the "Logistics Center" project, Walikhan Taskara, and the owner of the "Little Ladies' School" project, Akbota Bazarbai.
The winners and prize-winners were congratulated by Deputy Governor of the region Ruslan Rustemov.
Despite the decline in oil production, the region is developing steadily.
Governor of Kyzylorda region Krymbek Kusherbayev said that despite the decline in oil production by 10-12% over the past 6 years, the region is in a steady development, reports KazAqparat correspondent.
In the last 6 years , a total of 4.5 million tons of products were lost .
That means investment, jobs and business.
According to the preliminary estimates , the shortage of more than 600 thousand tons of oil was observed in the current year .
However, as a result of systematic measures taken in the region, by the end of 2017 we reached the positive vector of GDP for the first time in 4 years, i.e. 100.8%.
The plan will be implemented this year, despite the annual decline in oil and uranium production", the governor of the region said.
According to him, the amount of investment in industrial capital has doubled in the last 3 years, the number of employed people has increased by 55%, and the productivity of labor has increased by 18%.

Positive trends in the economy allowed us to maintain the unemployment rate in the range of 4.8% for 2 years .
This is slightly lower than the average for the whole country .
Despite the economic difficulties of the past years , we have not only not reduced the number of employees in the enterprises , but also created more than 68 thousand new jobs in the past 6 years , " Akim said .

It's not bad.
Be still in thy heart, and consider, and be not moved.
He recited all the poems of Abai by heart.
I also read poems, including those of Abay and Mukhagali.
I read it over and over again.
It's going to be a memory.
I remembered when I was young, I was fast asleep.
Now all that is mine.
I am a very sociable person, and I enjoy conversations.
I feel sorry for those who are "hurtful" because of his name.
It's a gift!

The situation in the country is improving, and "if there is a country, it will fall", D.Yerzhanov said.
This elevator was a Soviet-era structure that was unnecessary in the 1990s.
The company "Elevator Agrofood" has restored it to its former glory and now it is storing and selling quality wheat, which is grown in the Toray region, although it is small, but has a doughiness of about 30.
The wheat of our region of Turgay is of interest to China on one side, the Arabs on the other, Russia on the other.
We will soon install a German mill with a capacity of 70 tons of flour per day, and we will employ another 10-15 people.
We think we can afford to raise the salary again.
Today, 22 people work on the elevator.
We have increased the salaries of 5-6 people , who receive 32-33 thousand tenge per month .
This is just the basic salary.
"The work in agriculture is not counted as time, and sometimes when you have to do additional work, you get paid an extra hour", Kurman Abdrahman, executive director of the elevator, said.
The limited liability company " Elevator Agrofood " is committed to the development of quality storage and processing of solid wheat.
Now Iran is being cleaned and sorted for grain.
The President ' s instructions will be carried out without fail .
If we don't develop the economy, if we don't benefit the country, why are we doing this?
This should be the duty of every entrepreneur, - says Kurman Turganovich.
The entrepreneur is a hard worker and he is a man of his word .
The Soviet empire's red blooded generals celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Leninist Komsomol in all cities and towns of Kazakhstan with great fanfare - a challenge to our country.
This means that the Komsomol "decided" to support the independence of the Kazakh people.
The first of the "Alashordas" gold coins of the Kazakh state, in the city of Semi, where the followers of the red guendets, started by Nurlan Omarov, were the former leaders of the Komsomol, who celebrated the 100th anniversary of the red guendets.
And I saw on the Internet that the red pioneers were wearing red ties in the schools of Kazakhstan, and I was surprised.
Now I see these Russian slaves, that is, slaves who are not just slaves, who openly poison the minds of the young generation of the Kazakh, and I am amazed at these people... What an outrage!
How can we understand these Komsomol who are enslaved by Russia and who are depriving the Kazakh people of their independence?
Oh, you bastard, a slave is called a slave!
We must assume that the fact that they admitted that they were actually the slaves of the occupiers, that they openly expressed their "unbridled love" for Russia - is the first thing that the followers of yesterday's red zenets still openly recognize the Russian identity, which we are not supposed to have.
In 1986, the current "eternal deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aytymova, in the famous December of 1986, one of them openly insulted and mourned D.Konaev to Gennady Kolbin, who raised him in office, and now one of them said: "Comrade Kolbin, I will punish him by bringing blood from his hair to our hair", I have not forgotten the motherly words of the author of the famous novel, who wrote a story about the same national tragedy during the Soviet Empire, namely, in 1990 on the radio "Azaht" in the city of Munich, as the author of the one-hour radio drama, which made the world waves, I have not forgotten the words of the motherly words of the White Jumash Kokburyn!
The Kazakh people, who had rested from their mischief, did not forget about that time!
As a citizen of independent Kazakhstan, as the firstborn of the Kazakh ethnicity, I openly condemn the followers of these red jendets!
If our country is truly independent, I say openly that the day will come when the eternal president of this state will publicly punish or condemn the entire country as traitors who openly threaten the independence of Kazakhstan!
"My people, my people, my people" (Abai), this red red-tailed Komsomol is the moment when the whole country is openly condemning the Komsomol.
Awake, my son, for thou hast slept, and thy sleep shall not be known to history.
Never forget that, my son!

You can't even open your eyes.
Children are not going to school.
I have been in the wilderness, and my sleep hath failed me, and my eyes have seen no rest.
"I had to go back to the hotel after a long walk in the morning to get around the city", says Lisa, an Australian traveler.
Because the air is so dirty, it's hard to breathe.
I was able to get clean air from my country and I saw that a lot of work is being done in Australia in this direction.

The jury included Silvan Kutandin ("Letter to Sting"), Russian actress Elvira Bolga ("My Armenian Wedding", "The Ugie Girl"), Kyrgyz director Temirbek Birnazarov and Kazakh director Sabit Kurmanbekov.
Along with the main jury, the jury is composed of young cinematographers-students, as is the tradition in the "Basta" year.
This year the student jury includes students from Spain, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia.
The winner of the "Bastau" award two years ago, the Spanish director Yago Mateo Velasco, is the chairman of the jury, which will judge the works of talented students.
There are many film festivals in the world, but "Bastav" is a really good festival, which allows you to start well.
The fact that the festival is international is good for students, and we are here to get a little bit of insight into what the future of cinema might look like.
Of course, there's the Oscars, there's the Cannes Film Festival, but you can't go to the Oscars right away, so it's better to have a ladder like The Beginning that leads to the big awards.
The main thing is literacy, a new way of looking at the world, we want to open the door to the world of large festivals for unknown, young talents, - says Yago Mateo Velasco.
The guests of honor of the festival were Dean of the Faculty of Film Production of Korea University of Media Arts Kim Yen Du, sound director of "Mosfilm" Marina Nigmatullina and cinematographer, lecturer of the University of Karpenko-Karogo in Ukraine Evgeny Filippov.
The jury and guests of the festival will hold creative meetings and master classes with students of cinematography and film specialists of Almaty.
All events of the festival, master classes will be held at the National Academy of Arts named after T. Jurgenov and "Turan" University .
The platform of the international film festival is important for young people.
Students should see from their first job what competition is, not only what their peers are doing, but also how their peers from other countries are doing research.
The film festival is a different thing, but the interaction with the filmmakers and the exchange of ideas is even different.
"Starting" is a necessary step in the creative relationship.
Despite the difficulties of moving into complexity, the great cinema, cinema is evolving.
Film festivals are very important for this purpose.
The film is a collective work, a universal international film, and we will contribute to its development.
Here we do not just watch movies, but learn how to make them, says the president of the festival Sergey Azimov.
According to the organizers, the festival of student films, which was suspended during the Soviet period, continued during the independence period and this year it is held for the 7th time.
Despite the difficulties, the film festival has managed to revive the interest of the film community.

The Russian market is interested in the Kazakh halal products .
They set aside the produce of the land, and the food, and the provisions.
Since 1999, the mining company "Zlak+M" produces macaron products.
Their products are popular in the regions of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan and have reached the Russian market.
Our product is great, and it's really getting consumers interested.
The exhibition was well organized, but we didn't see many competing pasta producers, but the exhibition space is always useful.
We met with a couple of companies, and they gave us a good review.
The townspeople often came to us to sell the products we had brought to the exhibition.
The company's sales manager Petr Shaulsky said that there were many requests for all goods from Kazakhstan.
Even before the exhibition started, the chelalab residents were in line to buy Kazakh goods.
The "DEP" dairy in Kostanay has been known in the Chelyabinsk market for many years.
According to the representative of the plant Vadim Yamaltidinov, the company was forced to bring its products to the two-day exhibition several times.
The quality of our products is not inferior to theirs, but the local producers' products are more expensive in the market of Chelyabinsk.
We sold the milk at the exhibition price of the producer, which is undoubtedly very popular among buyers.
The main thing is that our customers are convinced that our product is natural, that the milk is not powder, but real milk.
Many people asked me, "How can you find products in the region?"
"DEP is working hard to cover the entire market of the Chelyabinsk region, and then we will go to Ekaterinburg", Vadim Yamaloddinov said.
Do not be deceived.
The foolish are many, and the dumb are dumb.
Now they're using the power of social media to make money in a very easy way.
Recently, the metropolitan police arrested a 23-year-old resident of Taraz on suspicion of online fraud.
The girl, who was identified as a prostitute, was reportedly selling leather goods and skin tones on Instagram.
To attract attention, he advertised the price of the leather to be cheaper than the market price.
The con girl, who knew that the sun's rays could be a source of irritation to delicate creatures, sent her pictures of girls in beautiful dresses, even to the addresses of the stores.
She was so passionate about her craft that she began to communicate with her clients via WhatsApp to keep her voice unrecognizable.
The company promises to deliver tons of goods to customers' homes, while also attracting customers.
The customer is asked to transfer 100% of the purchase price to the Qiwi wallet in advance.
What a surprise!
The people believed the statement of the unknown person and transferred money from 100 to 300 thousand tenge to the account of the fraudster.
The money was paid by the city's owners, who had been in the city for a year and a half.
After counting the dirty money, they lock the number, close the account, and steal it.
But the trick of the hypocrite failed.
The police arrested him and put him in handcuffs.
Currently, pre-trial investigations are being conducted against the suspect under Article 190 (property) of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan .

At a briefing in Astana today , the question was asked about the open letter of the initiative group on the change of the name of the region .
I know the letter.
I saw it.
In general, my position is against it.
The name of the region is very old.
I believe this letter was signed by 17 people.
I know a few people.
In my personal conversation with them, Sabirzhan Akhmetov, who was the governor of many districts, refused to sign the letter.
The letter was signed by the composer Kalibek Derypsaldin .
I think that it is not right to startle people here, - said Arkhimed Mukhambetov.

The Head of State supported the idea of establishing the day of the city of Shymkent .
Today , at a meeting on the issues of social and economic development of Shymkent , the mayor of the city Gabidulla Abdyrahimov asked the President to establish the Day of the city .
Historians are arguing that the foundation of Shymkent was 2,200 years ago.
We are preparing special documents for UNESCO as well .
But after centuries, the official date of our city has not been determined.
You yourself have established the special status of our city with a special decree on June 19.
In this regard , the city residents propose to mark the day of the city , " G.Abdirahimov said .
The president did not object to such an initiative.
However, the city proposed to base the date on actual historical facts.
Shymkent is an ancient city on the Great Silk Road.
Shymkent, Taraz is there.
I have no objection to it.
If we say 2,200 years, let's call it that, let's start there.
But it needs to be proven , - N. Nazarbayev stressed .

The rules of the fight against "black archaeology" are approved.
After the "black archaeologists", the monuments are left in the open and are being destroyed.
This was stated by Minister of Culture and Sports Arstanbek Mukhamediuly during the presentation of the draft law " On protection and use of historical and cultural heritage " in the Mazhilis .
The issue of regulation of archaeological and restoration works on historical and cultural heritage objects requires a review.
It is not a secret that our unique monuments or unexplored objects are often subjected to search and excavation by "black archaeologists", after which the monuments are left in the open and partially or completely destroyed.
In addition, intensive construction works in the territories adjacent to the objects of historical and cultural heritage have a significant impact on the historical integrity and preservation of monuments of history and culture, which has negative consequences.
In general, the need to strengthen the tasks in the legal sphere, which requires specific regulation and creation of favorable conditions for the protection and use of historical and cultural heritage objects, is undeniable, the minister noted.
According to him, in this regard, the legislation provides for the establishment of the procedure for identification and registration of historical and cultural heritage objects, as well as monitoring their condition, introduction of new mechanisms for the quality of preservation and use of historical and cultural heritage objects in the ultimate historical context.
In addition, it is proposed to establish rules and conditions for conducting archaeological works and combating "black archaeology", regulating the legal regime of land use in protection zones, the construction of monuments of history and culture, defining the legal regime of use of natural landscape zones.
In the process of drafting the law, international experience was studied and the draft was taken into account.
For example, Russian legislation includes measures to combat "black archaeology" for conducting illegal archaeological research, looting archaeological objects, avoiding the transfer of artifacts to the state, and more.
This means that criminal liability is provided.
In Italy, there are obligations for private collectors at the legislative level.
According to them, it is provided to establish and periodically update the list of objects of culture and art of historical and artistic interest and in private ownership.
In addition , the owners of these facilities are subject to state protection regardless of their nationality and citizenship , - said A. Mukhamedi .

As we have already reported, today in Astana there were foreign Kazakh heads.
The college heads are deceiving the country and the authorities.
The East Kazakhstan Prosecutor's Office conducted an investigation into the activities of colleges in the region and found numerous violations of the law, as well as the facts of misuse of budget funds.
In particular, the violation of the competitive procedures for placing state orders, false training of students, illegal awarding of grants, non-compliance of teachers with qualification requirements, failure to provide students with dormitories, as well as the receipt of income from illegal renting of state property were identified.
The number of graduates employed in the workplace is often falsified by artificially increasing the number of graduates, the administration of educational institutions does not provide assistance to graduates in employment.
Despite the fact that the rules of placement of the state educational order were violated and, in particular, students from other places were not provided with dormitories, the regional education department annually provided grants to the business and service college of Semey, the polytechnic college of Ayagoz and two colleges of Ustekmen.
The administration of the college included in the total amount of the contract for the cost of the public contract for the cost of accommodation in the dormitory for students, the cost of the utility services included in the contract, the rooms in the dormitory were rented to third parties.
At the college of the Kurkum, 12 students were falsely trained.
During the course of the training, teachers and masters of industrial training marked these students in theoretical and practical training journals, sent them to interim attestation, transferred from courses to courses.
In addition, scholarships were paid to these students, and the total amount of damage to the state amounted to 8 million tenge.
The case is under pre-trial investigation .
Facts of illegal use of property for private purposes on the territory of the college were also identified.
For example, on the territory of the East Kazakhstan Regional Art School named after the brothers Abdullins, who are people's artists, there is a long-term paid parking lot.
After the introduction of the prosecutor's recommendation, the parking lot will be closed and a sports ground will be built in its place.
According to the results of the investigation , prosecutors found damages in the amount of more than 43 million tenge .
To date , 36 million tenge has been recovered under supervisory acts .
60 persons were brought to disciplinary responsibility, 4 persons to administrative responsibility.
