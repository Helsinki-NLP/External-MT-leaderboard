Welsh AMs are concerned about 'looking like a Moffat'
There is a certain scepticism around AMs over the demands to change their status to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It was due to plans to change the name of the House of Commons to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs crossed political boundaries that were concerned it might lead to humor.
An AM worker said his group was concerned that it was replacing Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp refers to the word fire, while pwp refers to the word possibility.
Plaid AM said the group was unhappy and suggested other options.
A Welsh conservative has said his group was open to the name change, but as noted it was a short speech selling from MWP to Moffat.
In this context, the letter w reads similar to the pronunciation of the Yiddish language for the letter u.
The House Committee, which is currently making legislation to issue a new name, said: "It is a final decision that some commentators understand that members of Congress are called to blame for their own members".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 transferred the power to the Welsh Parliament to change its name.
In June, the committee issued the results of a public consultation on several proposals seeking broad support for calling the House of Commons a Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the naming issue of AMs, the committee supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
It looks like the AMs are proposing a different option, but the defense is reaching a unanimous decision that could lead to a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to enforce the name change legislation in the coming weeks.
The bill will include other changes to the way the House works, including provisions to suspend AMs and set up a committee system.
AMs will get a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the law.
Macedonia participates in the referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was created in an effort to resolve decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece because its province is called Macedonia.
The people of Athens have long claimed the name of its northern neighbour, which it represents, and have repeatedly challenged its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the Democratic candidates for the name change, has said he will not consider the election.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that the name change is only a cost to join the EU and NATO.
The core of the silence was the fall of Martin as a monk under the persecution of the Gauls.
"Historically", said Adam, "the old man I spoke to said there were bars and temples everywhere".
"Today, it is not".
He said, "Those bar bar-houses are understandable.
He said, "Today's people are in a relationship".
"The bar is the living room of the neighborhood where people go to play regularly".
For the church, he was worried that the money from all the sales would be gone as long as all the leaders wanted it, and sooner or later they would go back to the old way they started.
He said the church could be moved by a huge apartment building with different people in many rooms that would not help keep the neighbors safe.
He said, "Most of the people who buy condos in these castles are Leather people, so it would be a hastening the day that these temples will be closed completely because it is unlikely that most people who move to these condos will become these temples".
The city community in 1870, a century after Martin's rule, both churches were built by the Black churches before Harlem became a city of blacks.
The original Methodist church settled in the 1930s.
One of the black people who had been there before wrote a name on the tower.
Martin was occupied by a black church under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led a retail operation on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, refusing to rent or promote to blacks.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as the locals of the village of Pongsan planned to rebuild it, they entrusted the task of the central castle.
The reign of David Johnson, son of Perseus, father of the dynasty and next commander at Martin, called the castle the Poor's Castle.
Experts who played the medieval castle in July called it something else: "a treasure trove of natural treasures" and "an irreplaceable historical device".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan noted that it was the world's first central tower to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved into a larger central tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said Martin did not replace him.
What has been seen many times at the Martins in the last few months is a complex story of architects and engineers, some brought by church leaders and others by the Eveson community.
The room in the church, a local parish board, was set up by religious leaders, writing that the parish church in July, worried that the parish would try to transfer the cost of the room to the church, even if the room in the church was not involved in the hiring of the architects and craftsmen.
Some locals complained about the lack of balance on one side of the village.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark attack in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was swimming for a beach in California as the shark season approached, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. off the coast of Trianguli in Cincinnati.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was baptizing with a friend around half an hour early Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then swim back with the group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just the thrill of one catch, but then he "knew he was screaming", "I need a shout!"
I have to wait!
Hammel said he noticed that once he approached the boy, the bone was broken, the tape was pulled out.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a spider in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was taken to Rudy's Children's Hospital in Sandhurst, where he was placed in critical condition.
The species of attack fish is unknown.
Marine shark chief Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not designated as a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a head injury to the upper part of his head.
Officers closed the beach entrance from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Cincinnati for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of reindeer in the area, but most of those reindeer are not considered threatened.
The Sainsbury Project forced entry into the British stock market.
Sainsbury is frustrated that Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams have a stone-cut beauty shop with skilled staff.
As part of the massive push into the UK luxury market, the $2.8 billion price tag is continuing to rise as cars become popular and furniture falls apart, the large pedestrian shops will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and taken to many more stores next year, if it shows a success.
Capital investment occurs as retailers find ways to use up space, television, microphones, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of its retail offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing lineup from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with areas with similar brands to those found in stores like Boots.
The modern store also began operating its own small-scale decorative products so that most of the products were non-animal products, an increasingly demanding for young Indian shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance water retailer will be testing the contents in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Walking online shopping and the shift towards small daily grocery shopping in the supermarket means that retailers must do more to persuade people to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, said the stores would look more like similar grocery stores as the namesake stores in the mall try to fight off the discounting of Aldi and Lidl with services rather than food anymore.
Sainsbury has placed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and introduced some Habitats since it bought the store of the same name two years ago, which it says has supported the sale of perfumes and made the purchase more profitable.
The mall's previous attempt to upgrade its facilities and pharmacies has failed.
Sainsbury experimented with Boots in the early 2000s, but the contract ended after allegations of revenue leakage from the chemical store in its grocery store.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold its 281-bed pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the eponymous store Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would take the lead in the plan by adding several luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our boutique along our cobblestone streets to promote the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specialised counselors.
Our yoga labels are designed to meet the needs of an attractive and convenient location environment, which means we are now a luxury destination that attracts the attention of the old fashioned way of buying yoga".
Peter Jones furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left Furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for the house dresses and their makeup to be really crazy.
The couple's business has been compared to Hugh Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old performer posted on Instagram this morning that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones, pulling out of her hip hop business at the last minute to focus on a new contract for a live commercial home run with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Several sources said Jones was "furious" when the television blonde admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire to her new deal worth up to £1.5 million, meaning she no longer had enough time to take care of her house clothes and their jewelry, Truly.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is predicted to increase Willoughby's fortune by £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby posted on Instagram to announce that she had left, Jones left the UK to direct for a holiday at his home.
One source said, "Truly, Holly's priorities are at their peak.
It will be her long-term future that will see her for decades to come.
Her decision to attract you was a shock.
No one can believe what's happening on Tuesday is getting close to starting.
There's a packed warehouse at Marlow HQ ready to sell".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning commentator, one of the UK's most trusted stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to massive investments in products ranging from handmade and donated to home-made clothing and shoes and the potential for further delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Starting as a partner, Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business".
We had a very intimate conversation, and then we fell in love.
He spoke in a satirical manner about the criticism he would receive from the media for making statements that some thought would be inappropriate and positive for the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so out of step?
Trump said in his own humorous voice, "Newsroom".
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim's interest in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward North Korea's elimination of nuclear weapons.
But the futile negotiations were stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. summit on Saturday that North Korea saw no "joint reaction" from the U.N. to North Korea's nuclear arms exchanges.
Instead, he noted that the United States continued to impose sanctions.
Trump has had a number of perspectives in his speech.
He said, "We're doing a great job with North Korea.
We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results through the completion of rocket tests, aiding the Huns and accepting remaining American troops home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
Trump said, referring to the crowd directly in front of him, "It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get on stage, we're going to have about 200 people standing there".
The tsunami and an earthquake on an Indonesian island killed hundreds of people
For example, the earthquake in Lombok resulted in many foreign NGOs being told they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population in Lombok has been forced to relocate, no national disaster has been declared necessary to provide international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they are very aware that they are not asking for international assistance, so it's a bit of a challenge", said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is deploying a team to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if the international agency was allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Due to the earthquakes that Indonesia often cannot bear, the country is still poised for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, it is not uncommon on other beaches.
The lack of sirens alerting to the tsunami in Palu, despite the warning being effective, is likely to have resulted in deaths.
At its best, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters have made many of the world's oceans even more compact.
A rescue ship that was deployed in Lombok aims to treat earthquake victims and is also on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's fragile infrastructure by making it a key part of his election campaign and he has spent money on many roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds disappointed Joko's administration when he faced re-election the following year.
Joko is also facing pressure from the continued physical tension in Indonesia where members of the Muslim population have adopted a religious episcopal form.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim militants fought in the streets with knives, cages, and other poisonous weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's attendance dropped sharply to a level playing field.
Daniel Sturridge helped Liverpool to a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea and his team's goal in a 1-0 draw.
He continued to move the ball to his left before the shot pointed far forward.
This attempt came out high on the ground as the ball ran up the right corner of the pitch.
In the end, the ball fell on Kepa Arrizabalaga's leg and fell into the ring.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "It's just trying to get in there to get the ball and players like Shaq always keep the ball going as far forward as possible so I try to play myself as much as possible".
"I saw Kante come and hit the ball and I didn't think much about it afterwards, just scored".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the half-hour after scoring in the 25th minute against Belgian striker Eden Hazard.
The blue-coat batsman handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic on the pitch before returning to the centre position and running in Liverpool's centre.
Kovacic gave up and went fast in the second half.
He then hit the ball cleanly, leading Hazard into the hole.
Hazard rushed to defence and finished the penalty shoot-out behind Liverpool striker Alisson Becker.
Liverpool played Napoli in the quarter-finals of the Champions League at around 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The country's disaster agency said on Sunday that the death toll in the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were reportedly trapped in the building's crumbling patterns due to a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet.
Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was surrounded by the ruins of a tower.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with a gunshot wound in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for the murder.
Police urged the people in the area who had seen or heard something to come and give food.
Prosecutor Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would urge anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers who can catch something on camera, to contact us because they may have the information they need for our investigation.
A police spokesman claimed that the woman's body was found, that she was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found in the home.
This evening, all friends who believed they knew a woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police say they are in the process of providing information to the next victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in the Grayson Mews area has just tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He fell back when he found out what had happened.
Now the locals are being told that there will be hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She said, "It's so scary".
At about 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the police station, with another outside.
Some officers were standing inside the police station, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to provide DM @MerPolCC a call 101 or contact Crimestoppers as anonymized at 0800 555 111 citing code 247 on September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the House of Commons became the last memorial with a line reflecting the rewrite of history.
The expulsion would be the most appropriate punishment for the Taliban-like destruction of many of Britain's cultural and religious antiquities practiced by Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's version as "lily madness" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate that the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be a target.
The destroyer in the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell had wrongly sacrificed for the actions of Thomas's ancestor in the last century.
The remarkable representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th century thought and a piece of history that many believe is still valuable.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Probably more respected in the late 19th century than today, Cromwell is widely regarded as a champion of parliament against external pressure in his role of defending democracy.
Although representative accuracy is entirely consistent with historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict in the mid-17th century led to the continued development of our nation, and Cromwell was the probable figure representing the side of the divide.
His work as a minister of the Lord is worthy of praise and remembrance".
Big pig killer kills Chinese farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southern China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man with his nickname "Yan" was found dead with a blood clot surrounding his body near a pig's chest in a market in Liangzhou, Jiangsu Province.
A pig farmer vaccinated several pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with one of his cousins from Yunnan County on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, one of Kat's grandparents found him dead and found the door to the pigs nearby open.
He said that in the bowl was a large pig with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, the autopsy confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, one of my grandparents' feet bleed and was blind.
Security cameras showed Yan walking into the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to John or to any of his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was stolen away from them to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yan's family and the authorities are reportedly plotting his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig ran a whale farmer over to his tractor until his wife was afraid of the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC that not all pigs are normally hungry, but the blood nation can play a role as a "warner".
They're just playing.
They're the ones who make you feel so weird... they don't want to hurt you.
He said, "You just have to pay them a fair amount of respect".
Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa's is forecast to be weakened as it moves over the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southern United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa had winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and it blown 385 miles to the southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
A tidal wave is beginning to emerge in the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical storm surges into the southeastern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The storm then intermittently with the melting of the water, which would create heavy rainfall in the northern hemisphere over the next few days.
In areas with 1 to 4 inches of rainfall, this will cause severe flooding, landslides and landslides in the desert.
Tropical storm surge will cause rainfall to increase to 2 to 3 inches per hour at a point, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in some parts of the Pacific, especially in Arizona.
Tropical storms can occur due to rapidly adverse conditions due to heavy rainfall in the tropics.
It will be advised that there is a serious illness associated with walking in sandy fields with the threat of heavy rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause mountain valleys to become rivers with torrential rainfall and torrential rains will bring strong winds and torrential dust.
The flooding will bring heavy rainfall in some areas along the southern coast of California.
Over a total of one and a half inches of rainfall is possible and can cause slightly wet flooding and mudslides.
This is the first rainfall in the area for the season.
Some tropical rainfall will begin to fall in Arizona on Sundays and early Mondays before it rains more on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy snow will fall to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, extreme temperatures can be seen rising and falling throughout the United States, while the Arctic has a cooler climate, but the tropics remain warm.
This can lead to a remarkable short-term temperature change.
There is a great example of an interesting temperature difference in the central United States on Sunday.
Temperatures vary by nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between Lewis Street and Des Moines Lowe.
Over the next few days, the summer heat wave will try to re-emerge and expand.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to begin to be hot by October, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Celsius spreading from the southwestern region to some parts of the western.
New York City could reach a temperature of 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through mid-October.
More than 20 million people attended the opening of Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have attended a testimony hearing by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accused him of sexual assault in a 1980s case by Christine Blasey Ford on 6 television networks.
Meanwhile, continued political confrontation with the network interrupted regular program writing for Friday's last-minute twist: an agreement made by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had gotten her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school.
Kavanaugh in this exciting testimony said he was 100 percent sure it wouldn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people, Nielsen reported on Friday, have seen this.
The company has counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figure was not immediately found for other networks, but it shows it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox commercial network.
And overall, Nielsen has some problems measuring how many people visit the office.
It's a crowd similar to a football game for a grand final or a scholarship.
Nielsen said the Fox network, whose fan base strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's sessions.
ABC is ranked number two with a viewership of 3.26 million.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million subscribers, NBC had 2.94 million subscribers, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in the Friday Night Live episode.
After the Republican Party office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, shouting by protesters as he attempted to climb a film ladder to a courtroom session.
He stood with his eyes closed for several minutes as he was being chided, broadcast live on CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you".
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?
He was told, "You're in power when there are so many women who are not in power.
Flake said his office issued a statement saying that before the stairs closed he would speak further at the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were covered at the following hours when a judicial committee was elected to push Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a run-off election.
But Flake said he would do so with the understanding that the FBI would review the charges against the next week's candidate that the Democratic minority voters were seeking.
Flake was partially persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat.
After discussions with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was seen that the Republican Party would not get the vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British prime minister could accuse critics of "political play" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May may have accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May to the Bishops' Conference in Birmingham, England on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to this interview with her, on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson threatened her Brexit control plan, saying that a proposal that the UK and the EU should bring each other's wives together was "most cautious".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, a soccer player at LSU.
Dyton Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims lost his wallet during the fight.
Police found the van from the scene and said they found DNA on it that belonged to Simpson, according to a report from CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Times.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department is leaving the task force in charge of the Louisiana State Police, State Police Crime Department, Southern University Police and local residents to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked local law enforcement for its "violence and pursuit of justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played football for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU football coach Will Wade said his team was suffering from a stroke and a concussion due to Wayde's death.
Wade said, "This is what you're always worried about.
The volcanoes erupted in Mexico City.
Burning flames from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached several neighborhoods in the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for International Defense warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the movement evolved into the volcano's pit and it had a gas-fueled 18# and burning within 24 hours.
The center was tracking wind and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed the feet of flaming vines on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico such as Xochimilco, among others.
The team of geologists has observed a rising trend in the volcano, located 72 kilometers east of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been erupting since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence activists clashed with police and thousands joined the demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's political elections on independence.
The separatists, wearing masks hidden by the police, were conspiring to take drugs and throw down the mud, causing dark clouds along the roads that usually attract tourists.
The clashes broke out after the police used their knives to stop the fighting.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted, "Don't forget, don't forget", and confronted the protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were seriously injured in the protests.
Tensions remained high in the autonomous region a year after the October 1 census, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters have voted too heavily to be independent, although those who voted for the lowest number are opposed to the broad split.
According to Catalan authorities, in violent clashes, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the ongoing elections at polling stations across the region.
The pro-independence group camped on Friday night to prevent the protest from supporting the National Police.
The protest continued but was forced to move in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best times.
I watched my parents cry so happy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck, he's got a lot of heart.
Despite a modest victory in the regional elections in December, the Catalan pro-independence party struggled to keep pace this year with its best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the subsequent referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, 42, a mechanic who recorded protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
He said, "It's getting more and more stressful.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
"To run for election to the European Parliament is the best way to express criticism of the democratic devaluations and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
A man was arrested after a car was hit by a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was repeatedly hit by a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 pm.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage caused the door and the building to collapse itself.
The gun can also be fired at a few points.
Menga's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was a win.
Livingston's rise to victory surprised the Rangers, causing Steven Gerrard to lose his second of 18 games as Ibrox captain.
Dolly Menga's coding showed the difference as Gary Holt's team roared to the next level with the Hibernian team in minutes.
Gerrard's side remained unbeaten in the Premier League this season and faced the Hearts leader, who would score eight points on Sunday.
Rangers previously hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston then extended their unbeaten run in the league to six games with Holt, the coach still winning since replacing Kenny Miler last June.
Livingston missed the opportunity in front of a large audience.
Holt's team should have been led before they scored, with their lead causing the Rangers to have all the problems.
Scott Robinson regained his success through his hard-fought effort to get past the goal line to score an innings, but Alan Lithgow managed to lead his team well after the game to goalkeeper Craig Halkett.
The hosts are happy to have the Rangers play in front of them knowing they can make the audience problematic.
And that's how the big focus came about.
The Rangers received a free kick and the Livingston team made a stage opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly forming Menga, who kicked the penalty and scored from the middle of the table.
At that stage, the Rangers dominated the scoring, but faced an unmanageable defender and goalkeeper Liam Kelly, who rarely faced major problems.
That form of play continued into the second half, although player Alfredo Morelos tried to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman was knocked out by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow scored the most goals from Livingston's game.
The ball continued to enter the Livingston ballot and was subsequently dismissed as penalties were imposed twice after Halkett's game against quarterback Glenn Middleton and one for the ball was scored.
The "visible nature" of the Livingstons - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great ballplay and results for Livingston.
For one man, the players were perfect, and they still went beyond expectations.
Their playing and management of the ball have changed little since their return to high scoring, but Holt's great reputation has gone to the way he has promoted the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett's team president was keen to prepare a defensive line as Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
However, the Rangers had little motive power.
Fortunately, as they have done under coach Gerrard many times, they have fallen slightly short of those principles.
Their final goal was short - only when they beat the hosts, and it was a surprise for the Rangers to score in the middle of the table.
The first was the first of the two to be held in the city.
It was a bright and blue sky on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Edouard's controversial visit to Armenia in order to repair NATO ties.
They failed to address issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the European Union.
Eudogan then traveled to Cologne to build a new mosque.
The city is the homeland of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police raised security concerns to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Edouard, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard and condemned Edouard's policies and the Armenian government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protest reflected the split among the spectators by the Germans, some better known as heroes, while others insulted as revolutionaries.
Car crash in Def: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Devon, east of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped the car and the doctor came to the rescue, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist died in a collision and ran down Childers Road, about an hour away from Saturday's crash.
City police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Road closures and city car doors were made and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the riots
The prison official said six prison officials were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison.
Traffic broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30pm on Sunday and is continuing to occur.
The professional officer "Tornado" was brought in to deal with the turmoil in involving eight prisoners and was detained as a group.
Several officers were treated for minor surface injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Prison staff with special training have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and could be in jail longer.
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a crime officer was called to jail to handle a serious traffic jam because his staff was attacked with a drone.
Hurricane Rose is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (dry areas may benefit).
It's rare for a weather collapse to hit Arizona, but this is what could happen early next week as the energy left over from Hurricane Hurosa Rosa passed through the wetlands, causing an immediate flood disaster.
The National Weather Service issued flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to eastern and eastern Nevada, eastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to have a route to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in an article that there have only been ten tornadoes or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border".
The National Hurricane Center for the Last Hurricane predicted 2 to 4 ounces of rainfall with a separate count of up to 6 ounces in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the steep sandy plains, including the central Rockies and Great Basin, likely received 1 to 2 inches of rainfall with a total distance of up to 4 inches.
The relief of the area facing flash floods, rain, and hurricane Rosa can be a blessing as the area is drought-prone.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of the rainfall is likely to benefit as the wetlands are experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Tropical Storm Management Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona alone is experiencing severe droughts, the second highest, according to a report from weather.com.
The first path of Hurricane Rosa led to a landslide through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa remained strong on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moved northward at 12 mph.
The storm is hitting the cold waters of the Pacific and so its strength will decline.
So it is expected to make landfall in Mexico due to the strength of the storm in the afternoon or Monday afternoon.
Heavy rains across Mexico could have caused severe flooding.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northern Sonora in the range of up to 10 inches, weather.com reports.
Then, Rosa will move northeastward across Mexico as a tropical cyclone before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, a tropical depression that will move toward Arizona and southwest to Utah on Tuesday night.
The National Hurricane Center said the major disaster expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants was heavy rainfall in Baja California, northern Sonora and the sandy coast of the United States.
These rains are expected to create life-threatening floods and flash floods in the sandy plains and landslides in the mountains, among others.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested and attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested in an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stabbed wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4am on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital because he was in "very bad shape".
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officers urged anyone who could make a mobile video of the incident.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the pain and anger of the Democratic Party.
Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, that the vote for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and angry strategy.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered "pain and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress last Thursday, denying and dismissing accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused them as teenagers decades ago.
Ford also testified at the trial about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's glory and quality and courage" that day.
He told a crowd of West Virginia supporters, "A vote to affirm Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to affirm the most legitimate legal concept of our time, that of a public service lawyer".
The president referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
He said, "Five weeks after a major election in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting against other great candidates".
Trump cited the reason that Democrats have a mission to "stop and stop".
The GOP's senior leadership aide told CNN that the first procedural election to the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination was expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and rising death toll.
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed and many more drowned as massive waves of carbon hit the coastline as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered for a party on a sandy beach in Palu on Friday when a 6 meter (18 ft) high wave blew up on the beach in the early hours of the morning, causing many deaths and destroying everything on the voyage.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency BNPB, briefly said at a news conference in Jakarta that when the threat of tsunami occurred on Saturday, people continued their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, and they became victims.
Nugroho said: "The tsunami did not come on its own, it overwhelmed the land, it burned houses, it blew everything up. Moreover, the tsunami travelled across the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
He said that some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 places in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and collapsed, while an Islamic mosque surrounded by water.
The quake continued to quake in the coastal city on Saturday.
Subsequent earthquakes are known to have occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the magnitude of the bombing force that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is said that the geography of the city, located at the end of a narrow channel, can increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the extent of the damage as "great", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels collapsed.
He said some of the bodies of the victims were found under the building's rubble, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of injuries, deaths and damage could be higher along the coast, 300 kilometers north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the quake.
Nugroho said the communication was "completely cut off without information" from Donggala.
The Red Crescent said in a statement that "more than 300,000 people live there" and its staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected area.
It's been said that this is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami wave hit Palu, but officials said the wave came at a time of this warning.
In a photo shared on social media by fans, a man on the top floor of a castle is shown shouting a terrifying warning of the approach of a tsunami wave to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a water wall had leapt to the shore, taking the building and the car with it.
Reuters cannot tolerate the censorship of the language.
The earthquake and tsunami caused large power outages and disconnections around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated still needed food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the refuge in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
Doseba said that World Vision staff from Donggala made it safe to Palu, where employees were throwing in the colorful boats placed in their office yard, they had to face the prospect of destruction on the road.
He said, "They told me they saw many houses destroyed".
It's really bad.
Although the relief movement initiated a routine disaster relief movement, some complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can start operating once the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Sea, said: "It is still a provincial-level disaster.
When the government says, "This is a national disaster", we can be open to international aid, but that's not the case yet".
On the second night, after the Palu Island after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, their friends and family are still missing, and they hope that their loved ones will be spared the bad news of the natural disaster.
On the first day of the week, a young boy was pulled out of a pool.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been stoned for two days with her mother by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national clock team, has trained two clock students preparing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mandagi added that the other people who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior in this hierarchy", he said, "I have my own mental burden".
Gendon described how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, which was shared in his watchmaking community, he sent a massive WhatsApp message to competitor Palu who attended the beach party.
However, his message only saw a bronze sign instead of a blue sign.
He said, "I think that means the message hasn't been sent".
Thieves took $26,750 while installing ATMs in Newport, Levee
According to a report from Newport Police Department, a burglar on Friday morning stole $26,750 from Brink's employees who were putting money into a Newport ATM in Levee.
The drivers cleaned the ATMs in the entertainment industry and prepared to give more money. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was working, another man ran out behind Brink's staff and stole a bag for transportation.
According to the release, witnesses found several suspects fleeing, but police did not confirm the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Commonly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye and used his eighth studio album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande in the show, which was canceled due to "psychological reasons".
In addition to being the spelling of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word is of religious significance to him.
West stated earlier this year: "I believe that the word Ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It's from Kanye, meaning unique to the word "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", " and "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", " and "right" "right" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
This album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of the few rappers to have a name change.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West's co-star, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without a syllable and capital letters.
AMLO Mexico pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloodshed retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "never use the military to torture the Mexican people".
The military launched a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people as the left-wing student movement took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and open free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should be funding the next A.I. project.
Investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active on the issue of artificial intelligence, the United States should provide its own close funding in the field.
Many commentators from other parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI projects, although the U.S. generally lacks an official AI strategy.
China also announced its plan last year: It intends to be the leader in AI by 2030.
"Dubbed AI research funding is a good start because other countries are far from the United States and we're looking for new opportunities in AI", Lee said.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that the double funding could increase the chances of getting the next big AI outcomes to be done in the United States.
Lee, the author of the book "The Great Power of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on AI systems that beat out the top American Othello players, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and head of a branch in China.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's earlier technological challenges, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Human Development Project, and asked for further time to help identify the future of the scenario.
Lee said researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
Lee said, "It's not China that's taking away the academic leadership, but it's business".
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired people who help or influence others from many universities to work on AI projects in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the United States increase its efforts.
He said, "I think the green card should be automatically given to the AI class".
The State Council of China issued its next-generation entrepreneurship development plan in July 2017.
Lee said the Chinese Natural Science Foundation funds people on the same research foundations as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that have spent money on American researchers, but the quality of research work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Laboratory Investigation Center with the intention of joining partners from industry and universities, as well as the White House, announced the creation of a Joint Laboratory Commission.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For NSF, the company currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI project research.
Similarly, the US law that sought to establish a National Security Commission on the subject of intellectual property has seen no action in recent months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a solution to a decades-long conflict with Greece that has blocked its membership applications for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represented its claim to territory and refused its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but anti-nationalist groups claimed that the change would affect the ethnic identity of the majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a campaign of trade has cast doubt on whether voters would respond to the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be effective.
Question on the ballot: Do you want to become a member of NATO and the European Union by accepting a deal with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is worth continuing to enter institutions such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the few countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje, said: "I came today to vote for the future of this country for young people in Macedonia so they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us".
Although there is no legal framework, many MPs have said they will follow the results of the election to make it a decision.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority vote in the House.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 a.m.
However, the turnout was 16 percent compared to the previous parliamentary election, which was 34 percent in 2016, of which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje, said: "I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe".
The Macedonian leader, Zoran Zaev, and his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for the nationalization of Macedonia in favour of the country's name change, which would pave the way for him to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing to stage a small stage and took a seat in front of a stand prepared by those who would conduct a referendum.
Kavadarkov said: "We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join our leadership not through the service gate.
"We are poor, but we have a price.
If they don't want to take us to Macedonia, we can spread to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the European Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO members would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
Zaev said after the vote: "I am confident that the majority of votes will support because our people 80 percent will support the European Union and NATO.
He said the "agreement" result was "a confirmation of our future".
A poll released on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research said 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the poll, which is below the required number of entrants.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the poll to be successful, participants must have 50 percent more than one vote.
This failure to censor would represent the first serious attack on the policies of a Western liberal government since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has travelled through the entire defence of Brighton:
Forwards Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent the Brighton defender to a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very boring to score his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine received a penalty kick in the first half at the start of the match.
He fought three of Brighton's defenders before being sent off.
Aguero then saw four men in blue robes surround him.
He rushed to the front of a defender's neck before running off the bench at Brighton.
He then pushed the touchdown to his left, which was Sterling's penalty kick.
The England midfielder used the first-in touch to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to knock out Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew by scoring in the right corner of the net.
Pep Guardiola, the city's manager, told reporters that Aguero was having some problems with his ankle.
"We talked about his play for about 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky at the time that he scored a goal.
But it was because of Sterling, who was the first choice keeper to the Sky Blues in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a good pitch in Brighton territory in that game.
He delivered the ball well to Leroy Sane on the left wing.
Sen crossed the ball a bit before being sent to the Stalingrad to prevent a move to the defensive area from a distance.
The Blue body ran into the ball and got it in, just before it was thrown out.

Scherzer wants to play hard to beat the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force any other start.
But the highly competitive Sears hoped to get a game on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but if only to remain tied for the final game for the Rockies, the most dominant team in the NBA, the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockets were given the chance to play on Friday night in a 5-2 win over Nashville, but they were still waiting to see their first-ever title.
And even if we're playing with nothing, at least we can survey the atmosphere here in Denver to the crowd and the other teams that will be there, and see how high they're going to be this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?
The NHL has not yet announced the start of Sunday, but has provided details to the players of the tournament.
The forward will start his 34th match, with the ball being bowled on Thursday and will be played on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher for Washington scored 18 points to go along with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
The rally, a gathering of his supporters, is taking place in West Virginia.
The president made a mockery of the situation involving the Supreme Court selecting Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of the number of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
"Everything we did was risk a disaster in November.
There's still a lot of elections in our lives.
It's a big election, I don't want to do it, but I have to, so I go everywhere to find the best candidates.
He continued, "You see the opposition Democrats coming forward, now you see them.
And they pledged to take back power by whatever means necessary, to see their greed for power and their greed.
They don't care who is suffering, who they have to step up to get power and control, and what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
He said Democrats always have a mission: to fight opposition and to prevent it.
He said, "Oh, and you've seen them, and for the last four days, you've called the Democratic Party, 'the party full of anger, gossip and anger and no injustice.'
Speaking to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein called the call by name, which surprised fans.
What did you think of her reply?
Is it you who made the files appear?
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I remember -- that's not a good budget language at all -- the worst budget language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a major party.
They don't get along with people who say anything out of their heart.
When the Momentum activist in my party voted against me, it was nothing surprising.
I was the last Labour MP to be told we weren't welcome because we were saying the words out of our minds.
My fellow MP, Joan Ryan, was also offered the same treatment for her because she was strongly opposed to discrimination against the Gypsies.
In my case, the expression of opposition to me was my criticism because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of economic policy, national security responsibility in Europe, in other words, is a subject on which Jeremy disagrees with the previous leader.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday meant that we wanted the outcome of the meeting to be consistent and fruitful.
For more than eight years, as a Labour MP, the Friday night session was exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings promising political moderation and moderation have been completely forgotten and never started.
It became clear that different views were no longer accepted in the Labour Party and that all votes were judged on whether they were acceptable or not, depending on the party leader.
This started after Jeremy became the director and my former colleague, one of those people I used to think I had a common political vision, one of those people who started asking me to do something that was the opposite of holding positions that I never agreed to, whether it was in national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly, and no matter what I say, there's always a social media abuse that calls for the abolition of political censorship, telling me that I should no longer be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because some of my opinions are political.
I am impressed by the intellect and commitment of my colleagues who face abuse and racism every day, but never forget it.
The point that most frustrates me in this era of politics is that the level of abuse is commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance and acceptance of diversity.
The truth is, we are no longer a major party, and with the vote of no confidence or the change in the election rules, the party is getting smaller and smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years that encourages me to be self-sufficient and not talk aggressively, so I'm going to be fine.
But I didn't enter politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, which was triggered by the government's crackdown on Mrs Thatcher, which kept my large class from growing, I have been working hard to provide the best public services for those who need them most - whether they are councillors or government officials.
I've never been hidden from my own politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East understands my policy and what disagrees with the current leadership.
To those who supported Friday's theme, what I want to say is that when a country wants a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand why I want to waste time and energy worrying about the party leader, the workforce.
But the real message I want to convey is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my members, whether Labour or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise that no threat of not voting for or gaining any political advantage will stop me from doing what I believe is for the benefit of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr defeated Melrose 38 to 17: Ayr won to the top spot
The last two attempts may have resulted in a loss, but there is no doubt that Ay should have won the Premier League game in Tenent.
Now they're at the top of the standings, the lowest ever in the top 10.
In the end, it was their great defense, as well as the good chances, that the home team and coach Peter Murchie should be excited about.
He said, "They have tried our game so far and we have not lost so I have to sacrifice joy.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It's a great team, they've missed out on a better chance than we have.
Grant Anderson's attempt to score a try in the 14th minute, and his conversion of the score, by Frasier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but Scottish driver Rory Hughes, who had been dismissed by the Warriors, allowed the Mullins to score and James Baggot failed.
Climo helped the A's lead by scoring on goal in the first half before the player scored a solo try to make the A's score 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and scoring Patrick Anderson's lead and scoring a run-off by Baggot cut the score to five points.
A fight left Ruaridh Knott seriously injured and was sidelined, and since the start of the game, the A's have been led by the points of Stafford McDowall, who is now a defender of the West Indies.
Interim head coach Blair Macpherson of the A's was suspended, and Melrose scored more points by Bruce Colvine at the end of a tight game.
The hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded the card for starting Climo without hitting from the penalty line, MacPherson pushed back the Ayr team's lead.
Clemmons injured the ball, which he had made since the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe had kicked David Armstrong's box kick into the end zone and sent Gregor Henry to score the fifth goal of the match.
The actor in Still Game is looking to take a new career in the restaurant industry.
The actor in the game, Ford Kieran, appears to be looking to move into the restaurant industry after learning he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth series was the show's final episode, and Kiernan was looking to plan his life, and after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan was interested in joining the upcoming restaurant business in Glasgow.
Belgium hopes the court will pave the way for the Pacific
Fishermen walk to the naval headquarters of a rigging-clad naval base in La Paz.
The public buildings hoisted the flag of the Blue Sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is inscribed with the motto: "The right to the sea is ours".
To take it back is a duty.
Across the landlocked country of Bolivia, a beach that was lost to Chile in the 19th century resource crisis is well remembered - as well as the desire to open a ship in the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes have remained strong for decades as Bolivia awaits an October 1 decision by the International Court of Justice after five years of negotiations.
Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's ambassador, said Bolivia has a driving force, which is a sense of unity and calm, and expects positive results.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's decision through mainstream media across the country, hoping that the Hague court will believe Bolivia's claims that after decades of consensus negotiations, Chile should be obliged to negotiate a sovereign right to Bolivia over the sea.
Bolivian-born President Evo Morales, who is in the midst of a controversial re-election debate next year, also relies on the court's ruling on Monday.
He swore at the end of August: "We are about to return to the Pacific.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in Bolivia's favor, and if it does, there is little change.
The Netherlands-based United Nations has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law, said that the International Court of Justice's decision, which came just six months after the last debate, showed that the case was not complete.
Rather than benefiting Bolivia, the last four years may have set the country backward.
Zarate said the issue of access to the sea was rigged by the Bolivian government.
She said that the exaggerated words of Morales had undermined Chile's ambitions.
Bolivia and Chile will be able to continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to discuss after this happens.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represented Bolivia in La Paz, rejected the idea that the court's decision was too slow.
He said Monday would be a day that would bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict for mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains the most popular president of Latin America, was using the sea to profit politically.
He added that Bolivia would not give up the right of access to the Pacific Ocean.
This decision is an opportunity to show that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says it will not have nuclear weapons as long as it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not destroy its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington.
Ri said this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the pledge made during the summit in Singapore between the two leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be in the process of restarting a failed nuclear diplomacy that had been more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
He said it was a midday dream that continued US sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War would lead to North Korea losing.
Washington was wary of the announcement, fearing the city would not disarm first.
Both Kim and the US president agreed to a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang has difficulty in abandoning nuclear weapons, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Phnom Penh next month to host the second summit between Kim and Trump.
A Paris fashion show reveals the latest trash of a crowded hat set on the streets near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or wear a hat all day, look nowhere.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled an exciting range of large-size hats for their SS19 on-street collections, which were featured at the Paris Fashion Week.
T-shirts worn for fashion shows hit Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching hats to the fashion show.
The unique hat made by Valentino is a large, oversized hat that looks like a bird hiding in front of a model.
Other large-sized jewelry, like a doll's hat, is made of flattened wheat flour and other fruit - but they are not designed to keep the hot head warm.
Thom Browne also suggested a unique castle option - one for Halloween.
The multi-colored façade has a flattened face and is similar to the face of Hannibal Lecter, unlike the haute couture.
The other façade is a swimming-clothed façade with a sill and a vent, while the other façade looks like a long, hollow frame.
And if you keep up with the big fashion statement, you're in luck.
You're a motorcycle spectator who predicts that a big, fat hat will be famous and sold on the streets near you.
The La Bomba-sized hat is a two-foot wide leaf hat worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The idea behind the unconventional, social media-popular big hat led to another big trend in fashion shows - a leafy, almost-sized beach walker with the model that held it.
The brown leaf box, decorated with pine-like leaves with white leather seats, was the flagship work of Jacobemus 'La Riviera of Alabama SS19 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing the big beach hats and boxes on the highway for the summer because fashion designers have made such an impact that it's going to be hard to respond to the demand for materials of this size.
John Edward: Language skills for people all over the world
Scottish private schools hold the record for best education, and this record continued in 2018, as well as another outstanding test result, which achieved consistent strengthening in character and success in sports, arts, dance and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to students and their parents.
The private school aims to prepare its students for further education and postgraduate education for their chosen careers and their place as universal citizens.
In the field of education, which can organize and implement school curricula, in particular, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will enter his heart.
This is a reminder that we cannot rely on just one English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
And from the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are among the top-rated in private schools.
68 percent of all school students who learn a foreign language score higher.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved A in Chinese, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as the key skills children and young people will need in the future.
Many of the languages chosen as subjects are valued at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in private and other curricula.
A survey by the UK Labour and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers find it difficult to recruit employees were presumed to be language skills deficiencies.
Thus, more and more language skills have become a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
There are more job opportunities in the future that require multiple languages, so these language skills are fundamental in the linguistic universe.
No matter what career you choose, if you learn a second language, you're going to be really prepared in the future to have the skills you need for so long.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners from different countries will allow multilinguals to automatically take the lead in job competitions.
According to a survey by market research firm YouGov, of more than 400,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were not fluent in a foreign language to communicate, and French is the only language spoken by two-thirds of the population, or 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Multilingualism, especially for those in developing economies, will help to feed children better opportunities to find meaningful work.
Each school in Scotland will have a different language teaching.
Some schools will focus more on classical and modern languages, although others will teach languages that they think are most important to the UK and when looking at 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese, etc.
No matter what your child's interests are, there are always languages to choose from in private schools, and the staff at those schools are experts in all of these areas.
Private schools in Scotland are focused on providing an environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
At this point, it is impossible to argue in a universal context where language is so important to the future of each country, so all this must be reflected in the whole education sector.
Of course, modern languages should be considered a specialization of international relations.
Private schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
We have to make the best of it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron made the Lakers' first ever game in San Diego.
T fans' anticipation for LeBron James, who will be making his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers, has arrived.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how many minutes they have to play is not yet determined.
Walton said on the Lakers' website that it could be anywhere from one minute to 47 minutes.
Lakers quarterback Mike Trudell tweeted that James would play in a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers for a pre-season game schedule.
He said, 'I don't need a preseason game at this stage of my career to get ready for that.'
The Bible says that "the righteous will be saved, and the righteous will be saved".
President Donald Trump began a rally of supporters for the campaign this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of Trump's five meetings last week, with a few more being held in Tennessee and Mississippi, among others.
With the wait for a confirmation vote for the election to meet the Supreme Court's criteria, Trump intends to build support for the midterm election as the Democratic Party members face losing control of the House when the election is held in November.
What time did Trump's West Virginia rally take place tonight, and how did you watch it online?
A rally of Trump supporters in Willingdon, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia on the Internet, which is live on the table.
Trump is expected to settle a case this week with Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on sexual assault charges, with the Senate confirmation vote delayed by up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this massive crowdfunding was to help the Republicans who were running for re-election in November get a shot at it.
According to campaign media, President Trump revealed that the rally of five supporters last week was aimed at encouraging the many volunteers and supporters the Republicans are trying to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.
Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters that the parliamentary rule was crucial to his attitude that the president would travel to as many states as possible as we approach the hectic campaign season.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the meeting tonight at the Pittsburgh Stadium could bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and gain support from the Pittsburgh News Network.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to Virginia in the past month, a state he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the election.
According to Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Vermont, Guinea, it was not a good sign for Marsi that the president was trying to help him in the election.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show courage for the fight, hoping to advance to a match every Sunday
After three games of the round robin, a four-man team game on Saturday night was a demonstration of the Ryder Cup.
The speed pulse of a curve is a game concept that has developed in which players believe and participate in multiple games.
So if we could say, what is the speed of light now?
Jordi Spieth walks up and says, "They're six points over and now it's four points over, so I think we're a little bit behind".
Europe is more than equal, with four points ahead and 10 points left to win.
T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T
The cat mastered the guitar from the start to the final hole of the tee to green and the leading dance pattern.
The cheers for Cantrell grew louder as he reached his round of 16 and went on to score a key goal to tie the game at four as he and Thomas fell two after two.
His batting, which helped them win 15 games, caused a cry similar to a cry that told him he was confident the Americans would not leave.
He said: "You have to work hard and worry about your game.
Each player has already left.
The Bible says: "The Lord will make a mark upon the whole earth".
The top scorers and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the race.
The most interesting thing about Europe is that it's four out of four, and it's impossible to make a mistake.
The Moliwoods were the only pair not to hit a bogey on Saturday night, but they also avoided not hitting a bogey on Saturday morning, and a burkana (hit 10 to 18) on Friday morning.
This kind of running and the energy flowing out of the crowd shows that they are the players to win on Sunday and there will be no more popular player to secure a great European victory when the sun sets in Liguria, like Hvitovot or Molinari.
What you want is for both of them to go out in parallel through different holes.
It's not too late to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were playing slowly with fourball hero Sergio Garcia in the morning when he was supplied with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the team at the front nine led the Spanish and the Swiss into a hole they could not recover.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of the pit.
The fball (played two-by-two in the morning) and the fuss (played in the afternoon) are very interesting to watch because of the interplay between the advice codes they give that they don't give and the strategy that can change immediately.
Europe played better as a team so far, leading the day of the finals, but the match also showed that the Americans had the bravery to fight that some countries, especially other American teams, doubted.
Europe won the final on Day 10 against 6.
Europe will be more up-to-date on the final day of the Ryder Cup, after winning the FA Cup on Saturday and the FA Cup, taking a 10 lead against six against the United States.
Tom Fleetwood and Francis McLaren led the two-time winner over Tiger Woods to a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Byan, who were bidding for the trophy they lost two years earlier at Hazeltine, beat the Americans in the morning FA Cup, 3-1.
The United States struggled further in the Sixth Circuit, winning two games, but they still failed to hold on to the loss.
Jim Frink's team needed eight points from one game to one or 12 games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European goalkeeper to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were named after the second couple to play on the weekend, scored four points from the opening game in the history of the race.
After knocking out Watson and the three-point conversion in the final, they beat Watson and new American footballer Jason D. Chambloud perfectly by a 5 & 4 score.
Woods, who finished two games on Saturday, showed his greatness but still lost 19 of his 29 games in the FA Cup and the Rams lost seven in a row.
Josh Stinson took a break from football in the morning and returned to his partner, Henrickson, to play Samson 2-1, leading the Stinson and Brooks Coweepka teams to a world-record-breaking No. 1 and No. 3 ranking.
Europe did not play well, even on the cheerful, peaceful terrain of the southern suburbs of Paris.
The three-time champion, John C. Smith and Thomas, scored for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 over Spain's Ian Fuller in the FA Cup, and later defeated Fuller and Rammstein 4 & 3 in the FA Cup, losing the two-hole series.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team come back from a four-point deficit to enter the Singles Championship, although the Frankish team's holders needed a tie to retain the trophy.
After being ranked second for two days, the Sunday rebound seemed to be even more brutal.
North Korea says there is no way it will disarm independently without mutual trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions on the country were increasing distrust of the United States and there was no way the country would abandon its nuclear weapons independently under any circumstances.
Ryung-ho told the annual conference that North Korea had taken important measures in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, the expansion of nuclear testing sites and the promise not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "However, we don't see any response from the United States".
"If we can't trust the United States, we don't trust our national security, and in that situation, there's no way we're going to disarm independently".
Ri continued to complain that Washington was still opposed to North Korea's phased approach to eliminating nuclear weapons, and that North Korea should be relieved of sanctions when it took further measures. His key statement was that he did not deny the nuclear disarmament itself, as Pyongyang had previously done.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work toward nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised security for North Korea.
North Korea was seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for a tightening of international sanctions on North Korea.
Ri said the United States demanded the first elimination of nuclear weapons and increased sanctions pressure to achieve its goal of coercion and even opposed the declaration of an end to war.
The realization that punishment can lead to disappointment is a daydream of people who don't know much about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing the uncertainty among workers.
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader confirmed at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding that if the party to the nuclear disarmament issue is South Korea and not the United States, the disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be in lockdown.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that identifying the U.S. target of North Korea's rocket attack was inevitable after President Bashar al-Assad called Kim a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to eliminate North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures to disarm, but he also said there was much more North Korea needed to do and sanctions must continue until North Korea disarms itself of nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific deadline for this, saying that if it takes two years, three years, or five months - that's fine.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should approve the city of Phnom Penh for the measures it has implemented.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that the implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue steadily and successfully until we know of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has been pushing for sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block attempts to spend on Pyongyang's missile and nuclear program.
Pfeifeifei met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Phnom Penh again next month to host the second summit.
Pfeiffer has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that what he had achieved was that North Korea within hours had condemned him as having excessive demands on his grandfather.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to develop a missile and nuclear site if the United States takes appropriate action.
He said Kim told him that the appropriate or appropriate measures he was looking for were his promised security guarantees in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
A Harvard student attends a class on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year gave its graduate students enough sleep to combat the brutal culture that was spreading the culture of coffee to learn not to sleep like a sheep.
One study found that students at the world's top universities often do not even know the basics of how to support themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, organized the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this training course after a debate about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the conversation, a student came to me and asked me, "Why are you telling me this, since I am four years old?"
He told The Telegraph that she said no one had ever told her the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students the habits of good sleep that help in sports studies and practice as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief health officer, said the university decided to offer the course after finding that some students were not getting enough sleep during the week.
The one-hour course is related to the work of the Free Press.
In one section, there is a picture of a living room where students are asked to tap on a cup of coffee, shoes, and books, which are told about the effects of caffeine and light and how labor is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of sleep habits.
On the other hand, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school district with internship representations encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
Prof Czeisler added that we know that this course will not change students' attitudes immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking.
The culture of pride in urging people not to fall asleep still exists. He added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that their lack of sleep is a growing problem.
He said ensuring themselves that they get enough sleep should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. He added that it helps prevent weight gain because not getting enough sleep makes the brain feel hungry, which makes them feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and biophysics, helped lead the course last year during his freshman year at Harvard University.
They said the training gave them visibility and inspiration to promote a class for the whole school.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to complete a similar program before joining the institute.
Professor Hessler suggests that students should consider setting the time of day, such as when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the effects of blue light emitted by electronics and LED lights, which can cause brain circuits to go wrong, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston: Rangers: 1-0: Menga's goal to knock out Gerard
Renegades received another defeat when the striker to Limoges scored a goal to knock out Steven Rudd in a 1-0 win at Livingston ground.
In February, at St Johnstone Road, but Gary Holt's team made Gerard lose for the second time in 18 games as manager to allow his team eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored the first goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the captain of the team seemed unstable.
As the Flyers fell to number six, Livingston climbed to number three and was behind Hibernian by the difference of the scoreless shot.
And it could be more of a problem for the running back after the ball is seen out, the spark is healed of a head injury after an object is removed from the court and put on the field.
Gerard made eight transitions to the side that had broken the air and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holth, on the other hand, went with the same Levi 11, who scored a touchdown from the Hot 100 last week and was full of his own club, making his opponent take a breath away.
The Rangers were able to control the ball, but Winston did even better with the ball they controlled.
They should have kicked the goal, scoring in just two minutes when Menga's inability to enter the game sent Scott Pittman in and caused Allan McGregor to score a goal, but the line-up failed to take the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs's goal kick found the captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow kicked the penalty kick out of the back of the net.
The Rangers were keen to control the ball, but hopefully it was more than believing in their play in the final three.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a 25-minute penalty kick while he and Steven Lawless crashed together, but the District Attorney Stephen Thomson cancelled the Columbia trial.
Renegades managed only two goals on the pitch, but silent goalkeeper Liam Kelly, a former goalkeeper, was unharmed by striker Lassana Coulibaly and resisted an attack from Ovie Ejaria.
While the opening game in the 34th minute of the game was a game of chance, Levi's could be a game of balance, but no one could deny that they deserved what they were striving for.
Renegades again failed to hold back with the referee as the ball began to play.
Scott Arfield is unresponsive as Declan Gallagher stops the ball from hitting Scott Robinson, who retains his greatness, to pick up Manga for a simple finish.
Coulibaly took Ryan Kent and the switch was immediately effective as the wingman's line was tied to Morelos, but the forward Kelly ran off his line to catch up.
But Winston continues to attract guests to their favorite sport while Lithgow and Halkett are just two people in the ring.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final stage, but McGregor showed a disagreement before LeTour took the lead from the corner.
Replacement Glenn Middleton had another claim for a penalty as he ran into the opposing team, but Thompson was again out.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And this is a website from Sunday morning, September 30, 1882 today, 136 years ago and counting on... and the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
He developed a method for surveying and measuring geodesics, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
The importance of physics, unprecedented since the advent of the computer, has also become a major pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring unlikely scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is it?
ROGERS: It's a computer hardware tool used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium, etc.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear about the effects of the atom given by the radioactivity in the mineral.
IWIN: It's definitely coming up right now!
H. H. H. Hager died in 1945, just days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of the device bears his name to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to look at the cells of the spleen.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill the pathogenic cells.
This vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize and recognize the cells of the spleen, which is part of the treatment.
This method involves removing immune cells from a patient by modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then look at the common protein, which can be a lot of cancer, and then reattach it.
A trial vaccine has been successfully shown to have results in patients with a high level of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize the cells of the ovaries found that her ovarian cancer had gone away for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient by modifying them in the laboratory so that it can detect a common, potentially multi-cancer protein called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
If we say, according to Professor Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, "Our results show that we have a great vaccine".
Professor Jeburgsky explained that HER2+ promotes the progression of certain types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
Similar methods of removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells have worked effectively in treating blood cancer types.
Kanye West began to get into the hands of fans, dancing in a MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
It didn't work out that well.
Ken G. West expressed dissatisfaction in the studio during a Saturday night live broadcast after a major performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After he sang his third song that night, Ghost Town, and he wore the inscription Make America Great, he spoke out against the Democrats and raised his support for Trump.
I've spoken to white people many times and they've said, 'Why do you like him, you're racist?'
He said, "Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
SNL began performing with celebrity Matt Damon, who in Hollywood joked about Brett Kavanaugh's story before the Senate Judiciary Committee about a sexual assault complaint by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not televised, a video of West was posted on social media by actor Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Roe was trying to defraud Mr. West for posting such a video.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes about his clothes.
They have sinned against me behind the platform.
They said, "Don't wear this hat outside".
They have sinned against me!
He quoted the Washington Examiner as saying, "They said I was in a psychiatric ward".
"Do you want to go to a mental health facility?" he continued. "He should wear my sweater because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try to love a little.
His comments caused a sharp rise in dissatisfaction with the audience, and the cast members of SNL appeared embarrassed. There were reports that someone there told reporters: "The whole studio was silent like a dead man.
West was the student who was replaced by former actress Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mark Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Mr. West was very skeptical of performing the song "I Love It" in a Perrier Bottle.
Wells received the support of TPUSA's president, Candace Turner, who wrote on the blog: "To one of the most courageous minds: Thank you for speaking your mind".
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, commented on the computer that Mr. West was such a person and he was amazing.
But I've decided not to encourage anyone (just buying his rings or clothes or supporting his art) that I believe is pushing a paradigm that accepts changes and releases that are dangerous to my community.
He has the right to freedom.
She added: "So we did".
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now officially a celebrity known as Kenny West.
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's performance on guitar, also known as Puff Daddy and Puffy and P Diddy.
Following the events of the rapper Snoop Dogg, the name Snoop Lion, and of course the legendary Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then the artist was known as Prince.
The allegations of attempted murder at a Belfast hotel are linked to the murder of a man who was stabbed to death in a hotel room.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a hotel in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in the town of Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before a jury in Belfast on Monday.
The case will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has attacked the man with the poison.
Keith Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the fantasy drama series Game of Thrones (HBO).
But the 31-year-old actor attacked a misconception of the masculine virtue of the martyr, saying that the role of the protagonist in the story made boys feel they had to be martyrs to gain high respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed something was wrong and asked how to address the problem of the UK as a man with #MeToo poisoning.
Keith, who recently married actress Ross Leslie, 31, in Game of Thrones, admits that he feels a sense of urgency to address the issue.
He said, "I personally feel it's very important right now, what's the problem with being a very brave man?"
What do we teach some boys when they grow up about the problems we see now?
Keith believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of male nudity that comes from his own male character.
He continued: "What is it that comes from birth and what is it that can be taught?
What is taught in the mirror on TV and on the street that makes boys feel they have to be in a certain area (being something) to be a man or a real man?
I think this is a big question for our generation - how do we change this issue?
Because it's obvious that young people have a problem.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be writing a script for the thrones before or after the series ended next summer, saying he had already done a successful show on horseback.
Starting in November, Keith will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a film about a filmmaker and his brother a bandit.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers meeting his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
He said, "I met my wife in this show, so in that way, it gave me a family for my future and my life from this point on".
Rose plays Ygritte, the twin of Keith's lead character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy drama.
The couple married in June 2018 on the sprawling estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV or AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
The health official said that in the country, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
There were about 40,000 new cases reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of these new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike previous cases.
In the early days, the virus spread rapidly in some areas of China, largely due to blood transfusions containing the virus.
Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to near zero.
However, year after year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a complex issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been illegal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to remain high.
Because of the country's conservative values, a study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Transmissions of the disease mostly result from a lack of sexual defense in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make available a vaccine for the treatment of HIV as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied the employee's disclosure of GOP Senate data, criticizing it as a dangerous lie and conspiracy.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned the allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the House of Representatives' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat politician claims that the power of arrogance is increasingly pushing the professional and far-right websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that lying is the most hateful of lies.
Information released as a result of the report included the home addresses and phone numbers of former members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom were in Utah.
The news surfaced online on Thursday, when it was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill website during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court position.
The news came at a time when the three Senators questioned Mr. Kavanaugh's answer.
According to Hill, which reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the Internet service provider that identified the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and released information about Waters' staff members.
Worthers went on to say that the unfounded accusations were not true at all, and that this was a complete hoax.
 My staff members have been threatened with their identity, personal information and security because of false allegations and contrary to these facts, are not responsible for the spread of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false and are a complete hoax.
Waters's remarks prompted immediate criticism on the Internet from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Ari Fleischer writes that this rejection was made with anger.
This revealed that she was not qualified enough to be a member of the House.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They should not be so hard-hearted.
They should not be questioned about the motives of the accuser.
They should not be silenced.
Ari Fleischer appears to be comparing Ms. Wood's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee who ran to remove Waters from office in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
He praised the social media site, saying it was a big deal if it was true.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
She continued, "We will ensure that the offenders are brought to justice and they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and harmful to all members of my staff, including any individual".
A review of the film with a view against Johnny English Strikes Again: The Powerless Male Comedian Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition in the quest for the importance of the UK's withdrawal from European membership in a new, British-style film that could benefit from the re-establishment of the rights to the comic strip Fighting the British - which began in 2003 and re-emerged in 2011 with a new sequel, Johnny English Reborn.
Is this ridiculous talk about whether we're as thin as garbage going to be a new export opportunity for the country?
However, the English-language comic book artist Johnny English, who was also a comic book artist, was granted a second license to re-write his story - his name being a sign that nothing but a comic book creation for non-English speaking countries, but people like to see such films.
He was, of course, a cold-blooded secret agent who, although his strange appearance to Louis, was somewhat like the character Clouseau, a bit like Mr. Bean, and a bit of a struggling character, like the sound of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.
His character was originally based on the character Atkinson, a mysterious traveller and international man whose story was broadcast by a Barclaycard television commercial, leaving behind a stir after he awoke.
There was a good time or two on this latest JE tour.
I like the place where Johnny English (English) approaches the master in a medieval swimsuit and has a bright, bright, brightly lit flag on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comic books was shown, but the unique humor made him feel uncomfortable, uninteresting, and unfair, especially in the genre of hip-hop, mainstream comedy, such as 2007 and the Mission Impossible comedy series.
Comedy makes it feel like it's more about kids than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy, dangerous mix isn't about reinvention, and it's about as much about the quiet comedy of Atkinson's character, Ben.
The topic of regular discussion at the moment is that the UK is already in serious trouble.
A computer-based hacker breaks into the UK's top-secret shopping network, revealing the identities of all the UK secret agencies in the sector, causing the regular staff to be distracted - a sad little job for Kevin Eldon to take on.
It was the last chance for a striking prime minister to prepare for a major political loss: Emma Thompson did her best and with a staff almost identical to Theresa May, but with no choice.
Her intelligence adviser told her that because the active purchases were slow, she would have to take the retirees and return to work.
And that means it's Johnny English, who speaks his own language, who is now hired to take school assignments at a senior institution, but teaches informal lessons in how to be a secret agent: There are some good comedies here, with English providing a shopping class like the School of Rock comedy.
English was sent back to the White House for an emergency briefing and reunited with his long-suffering ex-partner, Beau, who was again played by Ben Miller.
Bough, now a married man, is sent to a naval officer in an exciting voice role in which actress Vicki Pepperdine is playing a very unlikely role.
Batman and Robin of the mismanagement of the creative services of the Lord of the Rings are back, facing off against the female protagonist Ophelia Bulletova of Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling under the thumb of a romantic tech giant who claims to solve the UK's computer misery: the dreaded Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their most ridiculous adventure: pretending to be a runner, they set fire to a modern French restaurant, created a disfigurement, and ran away on a hot-water boat in the direction of the Volta, and English sparks a sense of autonomy when he uses a tape recorder to create virtual reality to introduce himself to the reality of the Volta home.
All stops and spots were set aside for the final release, but while it was characterized by friendliness and a lush atmosphere, it was a children's TV show.
It's a good thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I still wonder, can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the stage he needs to be in for his talent?
Labour denied that it was not going to create a plan for the British to work four days a week, but was paid five days' wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a big, fast-track plan that will give the British four days a week - but pay for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's chairman to continue sending the savings created through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the employee workers, giving them extra vacation.
It's good to see employees enjoying three days of weekend, but they can still get the same paycheck.
According to the sources, the idea could be aligned with the party's economic style and there are plans to make the country more liberal towards workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported a shift to a four-day workday a week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of next year.
It will not be a one-day project, but a four-day workweek is a desirable goal, which must be met with the party's means of rebalancing the economy, allowing for the workers' pension as well as the party's general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party was not the first party to support such a concept, but the Green Party, which promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
The aim is currently not to gain the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
However, a Labour Party spokesman said: "Working four days a week is not the party's policy and the party has not considered that goal.
Former opposition leader John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to add details to his vision for the socialist economic revolution.
McDaniel said he was committed to reclaiming power from the head of the unfavorable and profit-making executive in the public service industry.
The former opposition minister's plan also meant that current shareholders in the state-owned company would likely not be able to get their entire shares back because the Labour government could do the cut-off on the basis of unfairness.
The former Bishop also confirmed plans to place employees on the board of the company and set up an environmental ownership fund to provide private sector companies with 10 percent of their assets to investors who are likely to steal up to £500 in annual profits.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, told the television show 60 Minutes, "Will the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh change their minds?"
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the office's findings could influence any Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, television news correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague, who comes from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, really".
I said I'd go to court, I said I'd talk to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was a man of sound mind, unshakable, and determined.
In this case, Graham's pitch seems to be very difficult to change.
He said, "My decision has already been made about Mr. Pratt Kavanaugh and it will accept the charges that could have been brought.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Mr. Pratt strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all the names she mentioned that she couldn't resist.
He was 36.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert event where a huge, exciting crowd of stars perform and share an exciting mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people rally to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, fellow rapper, Cardi B, and singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending poverty by the event's 2030 mark.
The Global Poverty Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of activists actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to attend the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or activities, such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls, or any other meaningful way to help advance their poverty-elimination goals.
But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a really good way to persuade people to demand action by calling for action, or is it just another case of what's called social activism - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing up for an online subscription or posting on social media?
Since 2011, Universal has said it has recorded more than 19 million actions from its fans, pushing for even more different targets.
They say these actions have helped motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars in U.S. dollars, which are set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group made 390 commitments and announcements that at least 10 U.S. dollars of the campaign had been re-opened or raised.
The group estimates that the funds secured have had a positive impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include providing nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to helping children grow to their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end the food shortage in the country after receiving over 4,70 social media posts from citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens as well as your image, we can make the social justification of food shortages a further explanation, then save more at the end of the page in history, the ambassador of the food programme, Tracey Ullman, told a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken, there was also a call for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and the government announced funding for one project, the Power of Nutrition programme, which will reach 5 million mothers and children, as well as nutrition assistance.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, which was asked, "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
The experienced citizens responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we fail.
But like the civil rights movement and the national budgets before us, we will succeed because we become more inclusive as we work together.
The Weeknd, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and the rest of the cast were among the few performances of this year's show in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborra-LeeFurness and Guy.
The United States could use the Navy to blockade roads to block Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior, Washington
If necessary, it could choose its navy as a last resort to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, according to a Washington Examiner citation, the US Secretary of the Interior, Iain Shing, revealed.
Singer accused Russia's involvement in Syria - the remarkable one in which the country is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - of being a quest to explore the new energy market.
He said, "I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to be a power hub, just like they are in Europe, the East, the Southwest, the West".
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
He said the US Navy has the capability to ensure that the pipeline is open and, if necessary, to close it to ensure that their energy does not enter the market.
Zinke told the audience that the event, which was organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, was called "Voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were similar.
Zinke told the audience at the event, which was organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called Voice of the Energy Consumer in the United States.
The statement came as the Trump administration was on a mission to push for its natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, a cheaper option for European consumers.
For these reasons, Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, has tried to persuade Armenia to withdraw its Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said has made clear that Berlin will become Moscow's main target if Armenia does not.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is being installed to increase the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economy project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was for economic reasons and that it was a model of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September that "I believe we share the view that energy resources are not tools used to put pressure on each other and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers".
The US move has sparked a strong reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organization of Armenia, the Federation of Armenian Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, president of the Confederation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between the archbishop of Germany, Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will take the most careful considerations in her 2020 presidential campaign.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she would consider running for president after the midterm elections with the utmost care.
During a meeting at a city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren stated that she would consider the position.
According to The Hill, she said it was time for women to go to Washington, D.C. and treat a burning government, including a woman in the top office.
"After November 6, I will be considering running for president very carefully.
Warren argued with President Donald Trump during a city hall meeting, saying that Trump was leading the country in the wrong direction.
She said: "I am deeply concerned about the impact that Donald Trump is having on our democracy.
Warren was highly critical of Trump and the nominated Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most Warren supporters think she should not run for president in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Center for Political Research, Boston University Population, 83 percent of potential Massachusetts voters said the Senate should not run for president.
Twenty-two percent supported women running for president.
The poll showed strong support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his race and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democratic candidates who have brought up the potential for the 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision next January.
Sarah Palin quotes the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of Track Palin at a crowd of Donald Trump supporters.
Tarek Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
She told a group of his supporters at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, gathering: "What my son is going through, what they will have to go through, I can understand the feelings of other families who have PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have when they return".
Paulin called his capture a big issue not to be taken lightly, and she also spoke of her son and other veterans, saying that they came back differently, they came back differently, they came back with a different story, they came back with a question of whether they appreciated what their colleagues, both infantry and airmen, had done for the country.
According to Dan Bennett, Wasilla Police Department spokesman, Flynn was arrested Monday in Waillary, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman, including reporting violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, Washington, D.C., support challenges to new mining policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum rights to victims of domestic violence or runaway.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed suit Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of asylum seekers who oppose the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit, Grace v. Long-term litigation filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August to oppose federal policy, was not released.
She said that her partner and her son, a member of the gang, had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for custody on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys assisting Ms. Hague described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as having filed multiple applications for asylum in the United States as the country faces the common problems of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee rights policy amended a 2014 resolution by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy does not apply to decades-old international law and constitutional law, federal law, or any other law.
The plaintiff said that federal law requires that all claims for copyright are judged on the specific circumstances and circumstances of the claim, and that such a ban violates that principle.
The lawyer argued in a brief summary that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter affected the U.S. economy, saying they could become entrepreneurs and a vital source of labor.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an immigration judge to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and violence in June.
Sessions said in a statement on June 11: "The right to asylum is available only to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in any social or political group".
Applying for abortion does not mean that it can reduce all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in search of survivors
The situation is even more critical for the survivors.
Risa Kusuma, 35, who is caring for her son who has a fever at a refugee camp in Palo Alto, said she felt very stressed.
The fire truck carried the body almost every minute.
Clean water is also scarce.
Seeing citizens return to their destroyed homes to pick up the remaining items and try to collect what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured included Twi Haris, who suffered neck and shoulder injuries outside the Palau Army Hospital and was treated outside due to severe tremors.
Tears filled his eyes as he remembered the massive earthquake that rocked the fifth-floor apartment he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There is no time to save yourself.
And I went into the wall, and Harris told the Associated Press that his family was in town for their wedding.
I heard my wife's voice crying for help, but then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe to go down.
US ambassador accuses China of threatening China with propaganda propaganda against fascism
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page daily ad in the US newspaper, boasting of the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US Embassy in China accused Beijing of using American media to promote a pro-democracy campaign.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the news of China's China Daily's expense in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in November's U.S. congressional elections, one of the charges China has denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing's government is trying to meddle in the U.S. election point to what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's ever-growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments have put in place advertising to promote trade, it is common for Beijing and Washington to be caught up in a growing trade war that has forced the two countries to impose tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said that China's tax cuts in the early days of the trade war were intended to target exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had affected American workers, farmers and goods.
China's ambassador to the United States, Branstad, wrote an article in the newspaper Des Moines-Rédailles on Sunday that China is now increasing its threats of double criminalization and propaganda in our free press.
Ambassador Brentstad wrote that in promoting his campaign, the Chinese government used the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines newspaper, the Christian Center.
He wrote: "On the contrary, if you look at the newspapers in the streets of Beijing, you will find the least amount of opposition and not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people have about the economic nature of China's growing problem, because the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China".
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had proposed not publishing his article, although he did not say which.
Analysts warned that the Republican Party was trying to alienate women voters before the midterm with the Kavanaugh crisis.
As senior Republican candidates prepare to defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces sexual assault charges, analysts warn they will see a response, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
There is a lot of interest around this issue, and most Republicans are showing that they want an election soon.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in a post on Saturday that the events were irreversible.
Reeher said Sen. Jeff Flake's request for an FBI investigation was not enough to upset voters.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for MovOn, said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow and in November".
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted that November was coming! Mic reported that as they protested in the Senate chamber when the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to step forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite testimony by Christine Blasey Ford.
Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website that the lobbying and democratic campaigns would be shut down permanently.
If someone says it's happened, it's true.
And it's already set that, especially for urban voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29. If they don't like the president, they don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts had suggested that a reaction would be possible if the Republicans pushed for further confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week: "This has become a huge embarrassment to the Republican Party.
Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a Democratic-led election task force, told the media that "it's not just about the election of the commission or the last election, or Kavanaugh being elected to the top of the list, it's about how the public should deal with the issue and how they should deal with her".
However, the American people seem to be more likely to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh than the testimony of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe strongly or less strongly in Mr. Shepherd's work, and 35 percent say they believe strongly or less strongly in Mr. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same to Mrs. Howard.
According to The Guardian, following the push from Congressman Flake, the FBI will soon be investigating the allegations made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee last week by swearing that Kavanaugh was drunk and raped at the age of 17.
Remirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee revealed his gender identity to her when they attended a party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web are planning a new Internet to beat Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, started a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology company, is a company that develops Solid software with open source technology by Bruce Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what information users are allowed to access.
In a separate interview with Fast, Bruce Lee jokingly said that the decision behind the creation of the Internet was to rule the world.
He said of the new company, "We have to do it now".
It was a historic moment.
The software uses Solid software technology to allow people to create their own personal online database store or POD.
It may contain a directory of contacts, a work catalog, a calendar, a library, a musical instrument, and other personal and professional information.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all of which are in the same browser and at the same time.
What's special about an individual's online database is that it's entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company called it "data-driven self-empowerment".
Inrupt's mission is to the company's CEO, John Bruce, to bring in the necessary resources and skills to help make Solid software accessible to everyone.
The company is currently owned by Brian Barnes Lee, Bruce, and the security technology was acquired from IBM, a number of developers were contracted to work on the project and a volunteer coders association.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own expert software using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenners Lee said he and his team would not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to completely change their business models.

Bernard Vann: The Victoria Cross since World War I has been awarded
The Church of England's first Victorian prize for heroism during World War I was awarded in his hometown 100 years later.
Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the raids on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt prisons.
But unfortunately, four days later, he was shot and killed, and he never realized he had won Britain's highest military honor.
A stone dedicated to a memorial was unveiled by his two sons in a public square in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandson, Michael Vann, said it was the cornerstone of the iconic iconic icon, which has been unveiled every 100 years since his grandfather received the award.
According to the Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Véronien Vaughan led his small squad across the Seine de Saint-Quentin, walking through the fog and rusty smoke from the battlefield.
Later, he rushed to the gun line, and with his greatest bravery, led the battle force forward, holding the gun and defeating the other three.
Vries van was shot by German snipers on October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Van, 72, said his father's career as a teacher was not so good, it was also full of self-deprecation.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the wreaths after the march, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, ended.
Michael Van continued that he felt very proud to be part of the parade, and he added that his true heroism was being demonstrated with the support of a large crowd.
MMA fans were standing by to watch the brutal Bellator 206 game, but it was like watching Peppa Pig.
Imagine you didn't sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206, but then you didn't watch the whole thing.
The letter from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the card, and was broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a game, British viewers were surprised when Peppa Pig's children's animated cartoon was turned upside down.
Some were surprised to find themselves sleeping until the next morning to watch the game.
One Twitter fan described the post-apocalyptic children's animation as the most painful comedy ever.
Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, said that it was a government order that at 6 a.m. the content of the program was inappropriate, so they had to switch to the children's program.
The Peppa Pig is coming.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would set their timetable so that viewers in the UK could watch the show together in the future.
Coker said, "I think when I think about the re-installation, I think we might be able to do it".
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't do this until Sunday is our hour, and it's their Monday afternoon.
But we're working on that.
Believe me, when it switched positions, it was a line up and down and it looked unlikely.
We tried to solve it, and we thought it was a technical problem.
But it's not. It's a problem with the government.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're going to have five games as usual, except for six more games, which we've done for our fans, but never before.
It shouldn't have happened.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels he is more vulnerable to sex.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daly says he feels inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but it's this weakness that makes him a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't know this until he was in high school, that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that being a parent made him no longer worry about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show is Kirsty Young, who took a month off to get treatment.
Appearing briefly as the first guest on her show, Levine, Dale said he felt weaker than anyone when he grew up because the fact that we love men and women is socially unacceptable.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of being weaker and feeling different from them is what really motivates me to succeed.
He wanted to show that he was a person to him, too, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his gender identity.
The two-time Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on many other countries not to condemn homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky enough to live openly about it without any impact and he wanted to give others that hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with an American film producer, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a huge surprise.
Last year, Daly married an Oscar winner, his twin brother, who was 20, but he said age discrepancy was not an issue.
"When you go through so many stories as a child, he goes to his first Olympics at age 14, and his father dies of cancer three years later, and he says it's hard to find someone who's my age and has had so much of that hard experience.
The couple became parents in June, had a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daly said all his perspectives had changed.
He continued, "If you asked me last year, I would say how I won the bronze medal, I don't care.
You know, there's something bigger and more important than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist now is Robbie.
His son, who shares the same name as his father, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father didn't admit that he was going to die, and what his father asked the last time was, do we have tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London or is he just going to go and sit in the front row?
He said, "I dare not tell him that the dog will not be able to come near me and sit in the front seat".
He went on to say, "I was holding his hand, and he stopped breathing, and until he stopped breathing, and he died, I finally realized he couldn't live as long as I thought he would".
The following year, Delhi participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the silver medal.
He went on to say, "I just realized this is what I've dreamed of all my life - getting baptized in front of the fans at the Olympics. Nothing makes me feel better.
And at this point, it also helped promote his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which talks about the process of trying to compete until he gets into the Olympics, and so to speak, he still feels so crazy.
BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on Sunday at 11:15pm UK time.
Mickelson, who was playing well, was moved from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will have to coach a game in the 47th Ryder Cup knockout, but he will have to change his game to make that stage end without a draw.
Michaelson, who played in the event twice for the 12th time, was replaced by team president Jim Furyk for the Hurling Cup (two matches in the morning) and the Hurling Cup (two matches in the afternoon) on Saturday.
Instead of playing as actively as he has played for the United States in the past, the five-time major champion has split his time between being a backup and assistant coach, hoping to correct what he has done wrong.
The 48-year-old, a skilled right-handed and a professional golfer, has never played poorly in a game, even on the Le Golf National course, but now he has difficulty playing, having always been a bad bowler.
And the on-field game didn't bother him much, so Michael Sand in the ninth round on Sunday will be facing the upright British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who partnered with Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If an American player who has lost four points starting from 12 games of the playoffs starts playing hot, Michaelson's game could be one of the most important.
Frederick expressed confidence in his players, but he didn't say much.
Frederick went on to say that he was very clear about his current position, he held a hug on my shoulder, put his hand on me, and he said he was ready for tomorrow.
He was a man of great self-confidence.
He's a great player and he's contributed a lot to these teams, both last year and this week.
But I never thought he would play those two games.
I've thought about it a lot more, but here's what we need to do, in this way.
He wanted to go out and play, just like everyone else.
Michaelson will break the record for the most Ryder Cup-winning players on Sunday.
It probably marks the end of a career as a Ryder Cup golfer that is not tied to his own record.
Michaelson won 18 times, lost 29 times and drew 7 times, but Frederick said that Michaelson's presence brought a lot of success to the team.
He explained that Michael Johnson was a good laughing stock, a good guitarist, a good voice actor, and he was one of the good guys on the team.
I think the players are happy with him this week, and I'm happy to see him.
He contributed a lot, not just to the game.
European President Thomas Bjorn knows that great fortune can be lost.
Thomas Bean, the European team president, knows from his experience that a remarkable lead to the final individual event at the Ryder Cup can be an uncomfortable race.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 tournament at Valderrama, where the team led by Seven Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but they were victorious in the final, scoring 141⁄2-131⁄2 points.
"You have to remind yourself that we got a big lead at Weldrama, we got a big lead at Brooklyn, but we lost at Weldrama, where we used to win, but that's it". Bean said that after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on both Friday and Saturday to a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National Stadium.
So, history shows me and the team that it's not over yet.
You'll have to work hard tomorrow.
Go to the game and play your best.
This isn't over until you score on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, and that goal is to try and win this, and that's what we have to focus on.
I've said so far, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what's on the other side, the team that has the strongest players in the world.
With his players' satisfaction for playing well on the pitch, Bean added: "I'm not afraid to say no to this.
Tomorrow is a big game.
Tomorrow is a game of character, and we have to play differently.
It's amazing that we can be there with our teammates when we're at our best, but when we're out on our own, they're going to test our ability to hit at a higher level.
And that's the message that players must understand, that they should try to play their best tomorrow.
Now we leave our partner to the side and he has to play his best.
In contrast to Beyoncé, Jim Frederick tried to make his players better individually (only) than they were playing in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four straight games.
Frick himself was up and down the game at the last minute, becoming part of the winning team at Brooklyn, but ultimately lost as the European team had a huge success at the Medina.
He said in response to a question about whether Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, had gathered his players to play until the final day, "I remember all the words".
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start winning as fast as we saw on the web at Medina.
When such a flare-up is happening, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfield game.
We also made our lines fit and we put them in the way we thought was best and greatest for tomorrow's game.
Thomas is tasked with trying to reverse and face Rory McIlroy in the main draw with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European teams in the semi-finals.
Beyonce with his personal choice of playing, he said, "I played with this team in that order because I think I can play it all.
The new German warship has been delayed again.
One media reported that the latest ships of the Armenian Navy should be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but they would not be commissioned until next year due to system problems and overhead.
According to Die Zeit, a military spokesman said that the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until mid-2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems with later delivery delayed the fate of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that the ship will be equipped with large guns, air-to-air missiles and rocket launchers, as well as some anti-aircraft technology such as radar and radio wave detection and low- and low-frequency sound.
Other features include long-term maintenance - the ability to deploy the latest ships up to two years at the marina.
Die Zeit reported that the delay meant that the newest ship, which was said to allow Armenia to build a power plant on the coast, would be obsolete once it was put into service.
The unfortunate F125 was leaked to the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and handed it over to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent ships to the builders after shipments have arrived.
The exact reasons behind the ship's return are unknown, but the Armenian media have raised some serious bugs related to software and hardware that render the ship useless if used to complete the combat mission.
The problem of the weakness of the hull was particularly important, especially the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships were in operation, requiring about 120 men, almost half of the old Baden-class naval forces.
The ship, on the other hand, was too heavy to carry out its operations and reduced the Navy's ability to further innovate in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz was twice the weight of the similar vessel used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the hardware issues, the cost of the entire project - including the technical training - is also becoming an issue.
It is said that the ship is worth up to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the original cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The latest naval issue is particularly important because of recent warnings that the German navy is gradually declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy was really lacking in highly capable ships.
The official said the problem was widespread because the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were yet available.
He regretted that the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could not join the fleet.
The National Trust learned of the secret life of the bats.
A new study, conducted at a castle in the Scottish Highlands, aims to show how bats use the fields to catch their food.
It is hoped that this discovery will open up a new window on the behaviour of the species' conservationists and will help pave the way for future conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Scientology will follow the common pipistrelles and the soap operas, as well as the Daubenton and the yellow-eared bat at Inverewe Gardens in the West Ross area.
Special cameras will be placed in key locations around the castle to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
National Health Service (NHS) staff and volunteers will also conduct a mobile survey using handheld devices.
The sound analysis of the professional recording process will all confirm the frequency of the mouse's calls and what kind of animal it is doing.
A reference map and report will be produced to create a detailed picture of the general landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Ecology Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which species are most important to the butterfly and how each species uses the reserve.
This information will help identify the benefits of wildlife management work such as creating open forests and best ways to preserve forests for bats and related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development that can cause resilience and impact habitat loss.
Wind turbines and explosions (high-rise chimneys in public) can also be dangerous, such as the placement of rubble, chemical repair of certain building materials, as well as the need for pigs, etc.
The fact is, the bats are not blind.
But because of their habit of preying at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when preying.
They use compact-location eco-technology to learn about the dangers and dangers of their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, pays a great deal of attention to the wild turtle.
The organization has ten trained experts who survey the sleeping and sometimes rescuing areas of the bats.
The organisation also established Scotland's first monastery for bats in the Threave, Dumfries and Galloway areas, which are home to up to ten species of bats.
The castle's keeper, David Thompson, says the area is the best ground for visitors.
He said, "Here in Threave Castle, we have a great area for bats.
We have many old castles, many trees, and even better resorts.
But there's so much more about bats we don't know yet, so the work we have to do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what bats need to survive.
He stressed the importance of checking out bats before repairing old castles, because if one damaged one, it could kill up to 400 bats and their young, which could cause all the land birds to die.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to disturb or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official of the Wildlife Conservation Society, urged the public to join in supporting the project.
She said, "We need to learn more about our birds, we don't know how many of our birds are going to run away.
Ronaldo has dropped the rape charges and has a lawyer preparing a letter to the German newspaper.
Football player Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of sexual assault allegedly false news, claiming that some people want to make themselves famous.
His lawyer is preparing a complaint against the newspaper Der Spiegel, which has issued a statement on the charges.
The Portuguese international for Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The Der Spiegel newspaper reported on Friday that Ronaldo was alleged to have given her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to 142 million followers after the complaint was reported, 33-year-old Ronald Dodd criticized the report as false.
The Bible says that "they will not be ashamed of themselves".
What they said today was fake news: Five-time Ballon d'Or winner says the same thing on camera.
They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's a common thing.
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of their job.
The player added, "I'm a very lucky person.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to file a lawsuit with the Guardian about the allegations, which his lawyers have described as misreporting their privacy concerns.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would seek damages for moral violations on a scale in response to a serious personal rights violation that may have been one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a country club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to Ronaldo's room, where he was alleged to have secretly raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mauraga claimed that Ronaldo had knelt down to apologize to her after the incident and he told her that he was 99% good, and only 1% bad, so he did it.
According to the document, Ronaldo admitted that the two had actually had sex, but it was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and photographed her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to settle the dispute out of court because she was afraid of reprisals and was concerned about public humiliation.
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to recover as she continued to suffer from the pain.
Ronaldo joined Real Madrid after leaving Manchester United during the trial, and this summer he moved to Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of its car makers
UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would be forever saddened if it lost its position as the world leader in automotive production after Brexit.
He added that it was unfortunate that Toyota of the United Kingdom told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
The man said, "We need a deal.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the absence of a contract would likely cost a lot of work.
The plant in Bernaston, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the European Union.
Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Bernasston, said: "My view is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will stop making cars in our factories.
Other UK automakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade would go, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concern with what the automakers are saying is the risk of a supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a timely basis, importing parts of the vehicle every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for the vehicles ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it could cause a border disruption, which industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts for the car.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to hold a conference for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, and therefore its production would be permanently halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was clearly outlined to avoid such border checks.
He told BBC Radio 4 today that we want the best deal that will allow us to not only be successful now but also seize the opportunity.
The evidence, not just from Toyota, but from other carmakers, is that we must be able to continue what is a successful supply chain.
Toyota said production would stop at some point, but in the long run, the company warned that additional costs would weaken the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses due to high costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is also the union coordinator at the plant, said his colleagues were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have laid out a clear and credible plan for future relations with the European Union.
The White House said his meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
The White House said Sunday that the meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back another week as the debate over the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was investigating Russian interference in the election of relations between Trump's aides and Russia and the President's impeding the administration of justice.
The question of whether he would remove the deputy attorney general, which could affect his independence, has caused Washington to debate back and forth for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstern had discussed, by recording a conversation with Trump, the possibility of removing the president from office by the 25th minute.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House early, and it was reported that he would be suspended from the court.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would not seek to remove Rossenstein from office, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Committee on Rules of Procedure, in which Kavanaugh was accused of sexual misconduct by a woman, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate election.
His current press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, she said: "The date for that has not yet been set, it may be this week, I see that it may be another week, because there are other things going on in the Supreme Court.
But we're careful, and I always report to the press.
Some media outlets will dispute the claim that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conference coverage was not due to dissatisfaction with some TV reporters who asked too late, but she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are actually late".
She also said that the direct relationship between Trump and the press will continue to grow.
She said that the President had answered more questions than the previous President had, and she said that without any proof, and that we kept the number of questions.
Ms. Sanders said that press conferences would continue, but if the press had the opportunity to question the president of the United States personally, it would be better to talk to me.
We've been trying to do this for a long time, and you've seen that we've done a lot of it in the last few weeks, and there will be a press conference in the future where you can talk to the president of the United States once.
Trump usually accepts questions when leaving the White House, or when attending an open meeting, or a press conference with senior citizens, etc.
Press conferences with only one newspaper attending are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have unveiled the reason for the surprise and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of a large press.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff at Scotland's NHS, fearing the test.
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working at Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and wanted them to continue after the test.
Jean Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter of intent that the UK will leave the EU in less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already committed to complying with the cost of applying for residence for European citizens working in its public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the UK's withdrawal have continued towards achievement as expected in the coming spring.
But the UK government is also increasing its readiness for the case of (Senior) from its possible withdrawal without a deal.
I know that this is a time when you are all uncomfortable and hard to bear.
That's why I want to reaffirm how much I value the contributions of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Co-workers from across the EU and beyond have brought valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and promoted healthcare work and benefited patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is like your home, of course, and we want you to live here forever.
American volleyball player Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee Press reporter Mike Organ reported that defensive back Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred before midfield.
Reed said, "He got to the knee line and fell there".
Several coaches and medical staff put oxygen to the player, Aubar Karbi, in the knee ligament before putting him on the mattress and taking him back for further examinations.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Aubrey had already had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee was trying to find out when the player was injured.
Aubrey, a sophomore, played his first season with the Tennessee Titans after transferring from Illinois.
They won the match five times on Saturday before leaving the match, which led to him winning the match 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay the highest tax rate when they buy property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a high tax on their property purchases in the UK, with additional fees for use to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme.
Such a policy would balance the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
The tax increase will be for those who have not paid taxes in the UK.
The bank expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers are set to pay such a high tax rate when they buy property in the UK, with additional money to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success of Jeremy Corbyn's lobbying and efforts to attract young voters by promising to provide affordable housing that the tax targets high-income people.
The bill would raise taxes on tax-exempt individuals and businesses in the UK with additional money to encourage the government to fight against homelessness.
This additional payment is in addition to the current tax on the cost of the services, including the high rate of tax imposed two years ago, the tax on second homes and homes purchased for rent, and for such taxes it can be up to three percent.
The Bank expects the move to raise the budget to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of properties built in London are bought by non-UK residents, which raises their prices and makes it difficult for first time buyers to land.
There are areas where the country's richest natural resources, especially in the capital, have become the capital city of Cambodia due to the large number of foreign buyers, many of whom spend almost all of their time living abroad.
The new policy was put in place just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering the cost of billing to help young people get their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of raising property prices by restricting land but not using it, and he urged May to drop the carpet at home in order to afford to solve the UK's basic housing problem.
Mr. Karin announced a housing reform that proposed management, rental and the end of eviction of innocent tenants from the apartment.
He also wanted to give the council more power to build more new settlements.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would resign as prime minister to uphold the British dream that the next generation should have a better life.
And that means tackling this complex housing market.
The UK has always opened the door to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
But that's not right, because it's too easy for individuals outside the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy a home in the UK, and for British residents, it's difficult to buy a home back.
For many people, their dream of owning their own home is far too far away, and for them finding the wrong place to sleep is a reality that will always be there.
George RUSS: My biggest dream is to rule Scotland.
Jack Ross, president of Sunderland Football Club, said his biggest dream was to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland international is pleased to help the North-East, who are currently third in League One, get three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
I want to play for my country as a good player.
Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland that if I got a B cap, it was enough.
But I remember watching the Scottish team play at Hampden Stadium so many times with my father when I was a kid, and it always reminded me of the team.
That opportunity will come when I succeed in running the club.
The previous managers of the Sunderland club were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow the big names, whom he had previously rejected at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this point will be determined by 'Can I lead this club back to the Premier League?'
He said that due to the design and materials at the club, it will enter the Premier League without any doubt.
"It's not easy to get there, but I have to imagine myself having succeeded in leading the club there".
Ross spent three years in the manager's job, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coaching staff at Heart.
He then helped the club from relegation to the Third Division and moved St Mirren from a weak side to the Championship the following season.
And Ross said he was feeling better than he had been when he worked at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled the responsibility for managing the Alo club: "It may be on the way to a real break-up".
I'm really convinced that management is more of a fair and right job for me than a game in person.
It was amazing because I was a good player, living a decent life and enjoying a decent amount of fun.
But getting in can be difficult.
There's a lot of work that you have to do every week.
I still do the same job, the stress and the pressure of the job, but management feels like the right job for me.
I've always wanted to be in control, and now I'm doing this job, and I feel the most satisfied I've ever been in love with, almost my whole life.

Polls found that the ideal time for a half-liter of wine is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The spring heat wave boosted the revenue of the UK's wine retailers, but it also put even greater pressure on the restaurant chain.
Figures show that bar and wine sales increased 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's consultant in matters of supply, said: "The continued heat of the day and the longer-than-expected UK participation in the World Cup meant that July would follow a similar pattern to June, when wine shops were up 2.8% and restaurants were in a staggering decline.
The 1.8-percent drop in restaurant sales in June was even more severe in July.
The number of bars and wine shops selling wine and spirits, which sell more than in restaurants, also decreased.
The wine vendors were also very busy, because they were exposed to the sun, but they were even more busy in the restaurants.
Look, it looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Across the store, wine and bar, sales of wine increased 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, a member of the RSM's Research and Innovation Research Group, said: "These results continue to reflect the trend we have seen since the end of the month.
The climate and the impact of social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when we talk about outdoor sales or shopping.
It's not surprising that the restaurant industry continues to struggle, even if sales drop to 4.8 percent year-on-year, which is painful, especially with the added pressure on costs that tend to continue.
The long, unpleasant, and increasingly difficult spring for food vendors is the only time that can determine whether temperatures appropriate to September will improve their sales.
Total sales growth in stores and restaurants, including newly opened stores, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in the opening of new Yahoo or brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker tracks sales in the UK's restaurant, bar and wine industry, working on collecting and analysing sales data from 47 executives with combined revenues of over £9 billion, and it has been established as an industry-wide investigation.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One survey found that one in five children aged just 11 has a secret media account that they don't let their parents and teachers know about.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of fake Insta sites.
The news has raised fears that pornographic content (photos or videos) is being posted on these sites.
Twenty percent of students say they have a master account to show it to their parents.
One in five children, who are only 11, is creating a social media account that they keep secret and don't let the older ones know.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts, which are the most used apps for referencing Instagram photo sharing sites.

A mother accidentally accessed his 13-year-old daughter's social network and he made a video about a teenager forcing others to rape me.
A study by the UK's Digital Awareness and a workshop by the Head of the Department of Men's and Head of the Department of Women's (HMC) at an independent school found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two accounts, and half of those children admitted to keeping their personal accounts anonymous.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is very difficult and painful that many teenagers have created online sharing platforms that their parents and teachers cannot see and find.
Elidh Doyle will be a voice for athletes on the Scottish Athletics board.
Elizabeth Dahl was elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics Association, as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Dyle is Scotland's most accomplished track and field athlete, and President Ian Beattie has considered this election a great opportunity for those who practice the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past 10 years.
Mr. Beatty said: "Ellid is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and the global athletic community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her membership of the board.
Ms. Dell said: "I want to be a voice for our athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won bronze medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta with four Olympic medals and is now a BBC specialist, collapsed after suffering a severe stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago today, I had a stroke.
I was born walking.
The doctor said that only time would tell me how much I would recover.
It was a very hard job, but it did help me recover, I learned to walk again, and today I exercise, I move fast!
Thank you for sending me an encouraging message!
The commercial promotion of milk from breast milk and maternal-to-cow milk has generated much controversy on the Internet.
The company, which produces a milk-based milk-based product, has created a lot of controversy on the Internet by promoting a commercial comparison of breastfed mothers to cows.
To unveil the world's first wearable milk-to-milk vacuum cleaner, Elvie Electronics released a commercial video showing the ease with which the new device provided a mother with a baby when breastfeeding.
and the four women danced to the sound of the song, "I am nursing like these, but I have no milk. Please consider this, not milk, but my milk".
And the song was sung: "Take her out! Take her out! Let me take her out! Let me take her out! Let me take her out! Let me take her out!
But the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of footage, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying it reflected the horrors of the dairy industry.
I'm not very good at thinking about bringing a cow to market.
The proverb says, "They were like us, and they were about to give birth to babies. Their babies were stolen before they were born".
The milk bottle of Elvie's mother's milk is worn with a single suit (Elvie or mother).
Another said, "A mother and her child are in great distress.
But why not use it to promote a milkshake for a breastfeeding mother?
Others commented: "I never thought of such advertising.
Others supported the commercial, with one woman saying she liked the commercial so much that it was so humorous.
I think that this kind of advertising is a good idea.
I'll buy one, and I'll be gone if I breastfeed.
I feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a stretch, but I can take it.
This is a product that is not being invented.
Another commented: "This is a comedic commercial for mothers (mostly at work or in a bathroom) to pump milk like chicken.
This ad is not about praising or valuing the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women said they were dancing with a bag of eggs in their clothes.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that women who breastfeed say they feel like Israeli cows.
However, the Elvie milk pump does not have a wire or tube, it is placed in the women's underwear, making it easy to move or spawn and can be released while soaking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, said: "Elvie Pump is a newly evolved product that is going to have a beginner's edge.
By linking the relationship between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we want everyone to understand milk breeding and its challenges, and we want to showcase how easy and enjoyable it is to learn about the simplicity of the breastfeeding process.
This is not the first time that Elvie's milk pump has been featured on the front page of the newspaper.

Hundreds of migrant children have moved to refugee camps along the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children incarcerated has increased dramatically, although the monthly border crossing has remained unchanged. One reason is that the science and policy set by the Trump administration has made it difficult to find sponsors for these children.
Traditionally, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants, and they feared that they would be unable to continue living in the country if they dared claim to have children (without proof).
The issue escalated in June when the federal authorities announced that sponsors and other adult family members must submit a fingerprint, which will be sent to immigration authorities for review.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief minister of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for grants to unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
 Nearly 80 percent of all individuals who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are living in the country illegally, and a large proportion of those are criminals.
Mr. Elkins said, "So we're still looking for these people to find".
According to the staff, the shelter said that in order to speed up the relief efforts, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court for a month of detention instead of appearing after 60 days, which was the previous basis.
Many people will appear via video conferencing instead of coming in person to sue their legal rights to immigration judges.
Those who are deemed not to have the right to live will be deported abroad.
According to the staff and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children are in the detention center, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or escape, among other things.
Some public opponents have said that the concerns are growing in large places, such as in Tornillo, where signs of children experiencing this are being overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to the city as a place to dump a flag, without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to talk to their friends, could lead to mental health problems for children who are already experiencing this problem.
Syria has ordered the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eight-year conflict.
Moreau, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces illegally in Syria, under the pretext that the fight against terrorism, we will deal with them on the way.
He ordered the assembly to withdraw their troops immediately and without delay.
Mr. Moorlem has insisted that the war on terror is coming to an end in Syria, and that more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with millions more fleeing their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to wage this holy war until we have driven all Syrian terrorists, terrorists and illegal aliens out of Syria.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 Marines in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return and he blamed some Western countries for spreading unreasonable fears that have driven refugees to starve.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these recovery", he said.
They are making politics about what should be a moral issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.S. diplomat said in a diplomatic speech that a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a property zone in the last stable defensive position of the Islamic State created an opportunity to promote political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to 3 million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be eliminated.
Staffan de Mistura, the U.S. Secretary of State, is hoping to host the first meeting of the new government and opposition committee to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the commission's work should be restricted to review the current constitution and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
On this basis, many liberal followers may be hoping that Trump will win re-election in 2020 once the allegations and scandal finish his presidency ahead of schedule.
In what is unmistakably "the greatest finalist for president!"
So far, there's no sign of your followers' persistence.
Since 2014, the weekly best-ever ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly equal to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers and 1.7 million in four years, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show", rated the highest viewership rate of any major news broadcast at 3.5 million.

She remembers riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
The ability to play in a hurry.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the news coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
The only luxury outfit that the most mature audience can possibly have.
And it's still not a citizen's post when you see yourself at 6 am watching a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of biographical background around the source for his book titled "Fear" by Paul Manafort. The Washington Post said that Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth black leather jacket ("raw clothes with a smile") and the implications associated with Stormy Daniels' description of Trump's, um, biology.

Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of "Pawn Stars", said "Part of what he's doing is making it feel like a reality show, that he's feeding you every night" - perhaps Trump's show changing the channel and the daily secret agenda (a fight against the N.F.L. that praised Kim Jong-un).
You can't forget one or you're left behind.
When I went to see Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn't go out with Brett Kavanaugh facing the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in question in the balance.
Fleiss told me, "I remember when we were doing all the crazy shows that day, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'"

In addition to the money, the flood is in the mid-term election race.
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania candidate is seeing a flood, responsible for the reorganization of the two-seat constituencies that are in power for the same seat.
Recently, the constituency was abolished again in the Pittsburg riding of Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last Easter.
Lamb is running for another presidential candidate, Keith Rothfus, who is currently the 12th Pennsylvania candidate, overwhelmingly with the new 17th candidate.
The map was drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old district was constitutionally approved in the Republican Party's favor.
The new 17th running of the candidates has affected a failed campaign between the Democratic Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC) major financial arm.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow minority victory in a landslide election in a March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, while President Donald Trump won 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democratic Party a little bit of a penny.
The United States was more willing to punish El Salvador than support China, and the conflict was later halted.
The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had little withdrawal from Washington.
Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a studio in Panama until all partners fired Trump's staff.
Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan".
But the sanctions are considered against El Salvador, which received about US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, could be painful for Central American countries and high unemployment and murder rates.
As the domestic summit evolved, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar rally last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior administration official made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomat said Vice President Mike Pence was to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in a sign indicating the administration's inclusion on the rally.
And three American missionaries returned from El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or new sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on any details surrounding the talks described by the three U.S. officials, including two other diplomats who agreed to discuss the terms of the agreement.
Their story was confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke in anonymous terms.
The Bible is a source of inspiration.
Waiting until the matter is over could be Robert Mueller's special advice on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which currently has considerable evidence in public records.
Mueller is reported to have also been training his investigation into whether Trump's campaign was conspiring with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress should change the sideline, he would face responsibility in that body as he prepared to return to the electorate again, and he would probably eventually have a judge as his friend.
That and many more, I don't want to imply that Trump's failure is inevitable, nor his uniformity in Europe.
There are many options being made by both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the long-standing struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the fascists resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the year of the massacre.
The history course focuses on the reflective and irrevocable democratic movements that are accelerated or slowed.
Today, Americans are facing ups and downs.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the spotlight since the report reported that last year he requested a presidential poll and estimated he was unfit for his position.
Rosenstein said the Times's story was not correct.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's request for a new F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or unfair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury on any charge?"
And more importantly, will we vote in the middle of the term for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in a long winter.
But I'm sure we're not going to fail because I learned from school in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis who had occupied my embassy.
She survived and emigrated to America 60 years later, I said goodbye to the Sabbath that had been with her.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers has a vision for a collision with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Austria after an impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month would put them in a strong position to advance to the Europa League's Group G play-offs.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut in the season to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he was convinced that the Rangers could make a great game out of this.
The 31-year-old said: "It's a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team.
"We entered the game believing we could get something and came out with a point.
We might lose in the final, but together, the draw is probably the right result.
They probably did better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
Going into Thursday, it's another big night in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's a tough game because they did well in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, we're sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, with everything that happened to my injury and the changes at my club, but there is a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the boys are very happy about it.
Hopefully we can move forward now, it's our last season, and we're successful.

Although survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance nationwide, said, "People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to make that conversation".
This is the place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not want to know your intentions clearly before then.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those options can be a key factor in pricing.
Bring your financial advice: Your advice can also help you find ways to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care can include a long-term health insurance policy, a cost-effective life insurance policy, a cut-off bond to help cover these expenses, or a mortgage with your own assets - as long as you have the money.
Completing your legal documentation: preventing access to legal battle.
Get a healthcare professional's consent to let you identify a trusted individual to oversee your healthcare and ensure that the individual is morally compliant with your wishes in case you cannot contact them.
It's also worth considering giving your currency the power to do so.
You will choose a trusted individual to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your credit is paid if you are unable to pay.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has health problems and they are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Detail the details of the written plan so you are ready.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by the tsunami and tsunami that hit Palu, Indonesia on Friday, officials said, and the death toll will rise.
Due to communications being cut off, rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggala, north of Palu, which is near the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow channel on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a controlled land mass lying along more than 300 kilometres of coastline in the central part of Sulawesi.
The land under this control is an administrative sub-district with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the economic movements of Central Sulawesi, especially Donggala coastal region.
Renicular mining is also important in the province, but most concentrates in Morowali off the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the islands of Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunami waves in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is on the brink of a Pacific earthquake and is constantly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some major earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami wave that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline. More than half of the deaths were in Aceh province.
2005: A powerful earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that swept into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have been killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying several villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A devastating earthquake devastated Pidie Jaya in Aceh province, causing devastation and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami has yet erupted, yet more than 100 people have died from the collapse of the tower.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian resort island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, Palin, 29, of Wasaga, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and has been prevented from arresting.
According to police reports, when the woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being sent to the pre-match trial center and is being held on a $500 bond, according to KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "clearly innocent" when asked about his defendant's response, according to a network report.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first criminal charge filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police to report the allegations of the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and disrupting reports of domestic violence and carrying a weapon in his hand while being involved in the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he had slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 for linking her son's brutal behavior to PTSD caused by his service in Iraq.
The tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people died
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck central Sulawesi, located north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Many videos are circulating on social media with timely reflections of the immediate impact.

Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspects in the New York terrorist attacks.
Federal authorities are seeking a rare death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment not previously imposed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot van to raid a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan that hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To prove the validity of the death sentence, the prosecutor would have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed "eight" victims and caused "intentional" serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death sentence filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both sentences could carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal judge sentenced Saipov to 22 charges, including eight counts of murder, in the criminal case of illegal trafficking, which was used by federal authorities in organized crime and the criminal charge of violence and bombing.
The prosecutor said the attack required "a lot of planning and caution", describing how Saipov carried it out as "a brutal and immoral attack".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and damage to family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the character designation noted.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York sentenced the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
More recently, the death penalty was carried out in the New York Federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, and executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit war crimes against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of civility in the days and after the attack.
Police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
Police said he also asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, the federal public defender representing Saipov, said they were deeply disappointed by the authorities' decision.
Patton stated: "We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the answer to the convictions of those who are incarcerated in prison without the possibility of parole could prolong the pain of these events for all those involved".
Saipov's defense lawyers had previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.

Nigel Farage pledged to "gather the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former Ukrainian leader said politicians must be wary of those who hesitate to join the EU because Theresa May's candidate for parliament suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
MP Peter Bone told a lecture in Birmingham that the UK would be out now if Farage were Brexit.
But the many challenges she may face in consolidating her deep divisions are highlighted by the Pro-Remains Tories, who are engaged in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her coordination plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies urged that she move forward with attempts to negotiate a deal with Brooks despite strong public reaction, forcing those questioning EU membership and workers to choose between her packages and her temperament.
Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to make the Chequers' identity known.
He pointed out that Farage should be established as a network of friends and responsible for negotiations with the city of Brussels.
He said, "If he's in charge, we'll go back now".
The candidate for MP for Wellingborough added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers Green".
In establishing a dispute against the European Union, he said: "We did not fight the war as a contract.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected the public opinion's suggestion that had changed since the 2016 election: the idea that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to continue remains untrue.
Brexiteer of the Episcopal Party, Andrea Jenkyns, was also on the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: the prime minister listens to the people.
Chequers are not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists, it has indeed gone down the road and got us to vote for the first time.
Please knock on the Checkers and start listening.'
In a letter to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs while they keep their promises".
Farage told the rallying politicians that they should make  feel hot if they betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
He said, "Now it's a matter of trust between us people and our political leadership".
They're trying to defraud Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you leave.
In a message to a very interested crowd, he added: "I want our political class founders who are linked to Brexit betrayal to feel warm.
We are gathering the people's army of this country to give us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are a self-governing, self-sufficient, proud United Kingdom.
The remainder of the group walked through Birmingham before opening a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists have grabbed the banner with the words "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's performance this weekend.
A fellow worker, Lord Adonis, derided the bishops for the security problems they had suffered with a party program when the conference opened.
He added that these are the people who tell us that they can have all the on-site information technology systems and technology for Canada without borders, without any interference for free trade without borders in Ireland.
It's all very funny.
He added that there is no such thing as a good Brexit".
Warren plans to focus on running for president.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has said she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November alongside GOP Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She became a focal point of expectations that she could beat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with a settler using the Capitol style since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to be president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington, D.C. to repair a corrupt government that also included a woman in the top class.
Arrested in the shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that the suspect was arrested in the shooting death of LSU football player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Police officer Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday on per 247sports that "Wayde Sims suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and eventually died".
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene with a gun and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6, Baton Rouge native, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finished as world champion after the team ordered him to beat Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas was qualified enough to lead Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team command would be a big part of the race.
From Paul Bottas got off to a good start, almost beating Hamilton as they defended their place in the first two games and invited Vettel to attack their team-mates.
Vettel entered the court first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic in the curtain, which was what should have been decided.
Mercedes then ran a lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a race to a few laps which saw the Ferrari driver stall, leaving the inside of the barrel to face the risk after two turns to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the red line of the relay and finished fifth by the end of the first race in his 21st round.
He then took a large part of the race as he changed his bike to quickly set course and defeated Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth round.
He eventually entered the 44th round but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen received the fourth round.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a good guy to tell me.
Hamilton said the team did this special work to have a couple.
That's the worst budget language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her insistence that she had not concealed letters from Christine Blasey Ford in the Supreme Court's allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony provided by Ford before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, instead saying what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "disrespectful and rude and dishonest".
"One thing that can happen and the good thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger when you see people angry and mean bad and untrue", he said.
When you're watching the news and the news comes out, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
What is the meaning of the word "the righteous"?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make the news?
Remember her answer... did you make the news? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't make the news".
Oh, wait a minute.
If we make news... No, we didn't make news", he added in the Senate interest.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it made headlines earlier this month, but Feinstein denied the revelations were from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't hide her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret when she asked".
But her refusal was unlikely to sit well for the president, who made the statement during a meeting Saturday night: "I'll tell you what the worst political language is.
She may not, but it's the worst budget language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense against the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the court suggested that Democrats use slurs to end the case.
They are committed to taking power in some necessary ways.
Mediaite reported the president's words: "You see evil, you see violence, you don't care who you hurt, you don't care who you compete with for power and control".
Elite League Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants:
Patrick Dwyer scored his second goal for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed responsibility for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants, taking a 5-3 win over Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two runs in the first inning to take the lead from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team before Dwyer left the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored a goal for Dundee before player Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals for their success.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the man Adam Keefe, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning three games the previous season.
Dwyer scored the opening goal in 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier lead four minutes later.
During a rough opening, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt tied for the Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first half as they scored his second goal on the final night of Round 1.
The hosts re-mixed and Bouchard again put them in line with the goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-round lead in the final in the second round, and he ensured a victory for his team in his fifth inning in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at Milton Keynes' home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to save hundreds of people on board, who could have escaped the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after his death for helping to rescue a plane carrying hundreds of people to a safe landing.
More than 800 people have been killed and many people are missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday due to tsunami waves.
Severe earthquakes continue to occur in the area and many people are trapped in a shallow cave in Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the high-powered control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Palu Airport.
He maintained the confidence to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 could fly safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He died in hospital.
Australian ABC reported that Indonesian Airlines spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives.
We arranged a transfer from Balikpapan in Kalimantan province to take him to a major hospital in another city.
But unfortunately we lost him this morning before the appeal reached Palu.
He added, "Our hearts are heavy with hearing this".
Authorities are also concerned that the death toll could rise to thousands, with the country's disaster response agency saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong towns is limited.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency, said: "The death toll is believed to be on the rise as many bodies remain under the rubble while many people cannot be contacted.
Waves that reached six metres destroyed Palu, which will have to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance carries a lot of bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being robbed everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the victims, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks related to human trafficking.
Are you still awake?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man has now gone missing after a plane crashed in a salt lake off the coast of Micronesia.
The airline operating a flight that crashed into a salt lake off the Pacific coast of Micronesia now says a man is missing after saying the 47 passengers and crew escaped safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday evening it could not count the passengers as male.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details about the passenger such as his age or nationality.
A local boat rescued passengers and other crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and they were all in critical condition.
What causes the collapse and sequence of real events remains unclear.
Both the U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane landed in a salt lake near the beach in a short landing route.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overstepped the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed low.
Jaynes said, "That's a really good thing.
Jaynes said he and others walked through the deep water at the fire escape on the sinking plane.
He said the pilot was scared, cried and cried and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors were working nearby to improve the sound of a ship and they also rescued by using a windshield to carry people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network showed that 111 people died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but not involving Air Niugini.
Analysts have turned down the time women were burned alive at night.
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday on the trial of a man accused of burning a deadly missile in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to break up with the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
The Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford when the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford made a statement on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville".
Another irony is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records show that the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "He forgot her out of his life.
The defence counsel's final trial is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge also said he expects the court to be sent to the court on the same day.

The three-piece hip hop group challenged the notion of sex by filling their sound with a variety of positive messages.
The Hybrid group from Bristol claimed that the hip hop group had starved away from the source of political messages and social issues.
They wanted to go back to their native nest and make hip hop music that focused on the soul popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York woman sued a couple for dismissal after receiving a "nationalist" message.
A New York woman is suing her husband for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a false tip from her mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racist as opposed to the camp.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a single mother of two, expressed condolences when she discovered that new childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message saying, "No, another black man".
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice Signal twice.
According to the New York Post, after learning of her "uncomfortable" behavior, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice's sign, stating that their vulnerable African American daughters were doing a bad job and she expected Filipinos to replace them.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent her home by Uber.
Now, Ms. Maurice has sued the couple to grieve over their dismissal and is seeking compensation with $350 a day for six months for the job she initially hired to do despite not having a contract.
She told the Post on Friday: "I want to show them that you don't do that". He added: "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple attacked claims that they were racist, saying that the termination of Ms. Maurice's work was a reasonable thing to do, fearing they would not trust her after convincing her.
"My wife sent her a message saying she didn't want to say that.
She's not racist.
We are not racist, says Joel Plasco's husband to the Post.
"But will you put your child in the hands of someone who has been mistreated and thrown into the chest?
What is your newborn?
Hurry up".
Likely suing for the rape, Plasco said his wife had just given birth to a two-month-old baby and he was in a very difficult condition.
"Would you put up with someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do, the financial and business advisers added.
As the case progressed, the court of public opinion quickly announced to condemn the couple on social media for criticizing their conduct and reasoning.
A new paper has released that the publishers of Paddington feared nonfiction readers would be concerned about the wolf.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book, was accepted, saying of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes by reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's very sad to know now what we know about Paddington's great success.
Saying her father had worked as a BBC photographer before being inspired to write a children's book by a small-time detective would have a positive outlook on his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was timed after his death last year.
It was Paddington, whom she described as "the most important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
She said, "He's a quiet man, and he's not a proud man".
But because Paddington is real to him, it's like if you have one child who accomplishes something: you're proud of them even if it's not your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that short way.
Although it was his invention and imagination, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying, and I have to say it on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where a team of doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
Ednan-Laperouse said, "Nad is often called up to say it's too bad she wasn't expected to do it".
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to talk to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The pharmacist gave her to keep her heart pumped, to stop slowly and to leave her system.
She died a while ago, and this is all closed.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was being disclosed.
I couldn't mourn or cry or cry because I was in a situation where family and people were around me.
I really need to take it with me".
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of the suffering she was going through.
She said, "No one knows".
"I kept my head down and shed tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's on the plane that I feel sorry for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved her".
Making the roads hurt by traditional letters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys placed a traditional card on the Well Bridge with a message of encouragement and phone numbers that people can call to help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want any parent to feel the way I do today.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a good cook with a romantic crush.
"Everyone knew him by his gestures.
They always say his nose lights up a room".
However, he quit his job before he died because he was stuck in the darkest place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was the discoverer of his relatives after he took his own life.
"I'm still worried about the impact", Davis said.
Ms. Davis created the card, "to let people know there's someone there so you can go and you can talk to them even if it's a friend.
Do not sit still - you must speak".
Humphreys, a friend of Davies's for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after the death of his mother.
She said, "He didn't say he was feeling depressed or depressed or anything.
"Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the lowest-looking Christmas when the kids opened their codes, he didn't look at them or anything".
She said his death was a huge blow to them, but they had to work to deal with those issues: "It's breaking a hole through the family.
It's what separates us.
But we all have to keep fighting and fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is put in a critical condition as the FBI begins its own investigation.
Flake said on Saturday, "I think if we can really get something like what he's asking, a limited-term investigation, we might be able to bring less consistency", and expressed concern that the committee is disbanding at a time of unreformable opposition.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their suspicion is due to timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do poorly, they will have to weaken their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush received a call to appeal to the Senate, persuading them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
It will have one election in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sitting.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Mike Pence to become vice president and to end the relationship and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fighters has fallen under Kim.
A South Korean MP said the number of North Korean refugees fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, saying that there were 1,127 rabbit runners last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said border control between North Korea and China and high pricing from human traffickers were key factors.
The city of Phnom Penh did not make a public statement.
Most of the fleeing North Koreans were granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is more easily crossed than the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the fugitives to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly displaces them.
Relations between North Korea and North Korea - still on the brink of war - have grown significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Beijing for talks focused on the negotiation of a nuclear disarmament.
This comes after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed to a comprehensive terms to work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, "Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation there is no way we will be excluded by ourselves".
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who was suffering from neurological disorders, and said he was not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a neurological illness and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi spoke of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, saying, "I can't help but think if a woman ever did that, they would say, 'Sneak out.'"
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his speech, Kavanaugh was excited as he cried and barked as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also condemned the Democratic Party's standing against the committee, calling for charges against him of "crazy political assassination and conspiracy" orchestrated by the angry Liberal group that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was anti-Democratic.
She said, "I don't think he's qualified enough with those statements and the way he's been following Clinton and the Democratic Party".
Pelosi was controversial when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
Pelosi said, "I'm going to say this, if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only not fit to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now".
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision to the Affordable Care Act, Roe v. Wade, which he considered a bishop's court.
In his testimony, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would dismiss the Supreme Court's decision.
Pelosi said, "It's not the time for angry and arrogant people to go to court and expect us to say it's not great".
And women need to hold it.
It was a moral critique of months and years of raging anger, and she couldn't take it out without tears.
Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry".
"I don't think it's that weird, is it?"
She continued, "I was greatly rescued from a woman who was a local executive who said she cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that means that when she was angry and started talking to someone, she said, 'You might think I was crying because I was crying and look.
I was angry".
And then she just kept going.
And I think that's great".
Tears are allowed as a place for anger in part because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my first job as an office manager was seeing myself crying with an unspoken rage, being kicked in my window by an elderly woman who was the best manager I ever wanted, and being a little scared - pushing me down the stairs.
She told me, "Don't let them see you crying.
They don't know how angry you are.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they understand you.
Then, Democratic Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder of Colorado worked with Gary Hart in his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in a romance without marriage on a boat called the "deception act" and suspended from the race, Schroeder was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she should not seek the idea of becoming president herself.
Thirty years later, she smiled at me and said, "That's not a good decision.
"There are already seven candidates in this race, and the last thing they need is another candidate.
They called it "The Seven Believers and the White Rose".
Due to the campaign's delays, she was behind fundraising and therefore vowed not to compete until she earned $2 million.
It's a loss of battle.
She found that some of her fans who gave $1,000 to the men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounted?" She wondered.
When she made the announcement that she would not officially start the campaign, she really wanted to win the sentiment - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to earn money and target voters rather than the audience, and anger at the sex she was getting upset about.
Schroeder recalled how the press responded to her: "You'd think I was desperate that nothing could happen".
"You want to think Kleenex is my business partner.
I wonder what they would put on the head of the tomb?
"She was crying?"
How can a US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The experts said the opening of the trade war between the United States and China was causing disruption, and as the fighting was not over, the tensions between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump first issued a warning earlier this year by imposing a major Chinese export tax on solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant price increases occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion in goods (£150 billion) taking effect on taxing half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly imposed a five to 10 percent tax on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to retaliate with the United States, and the world's second-largest economic power will never be forgotten.
Keeping Washington back meant giving in to demands, but publicly kicking the US would be a great embarrassment to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But the expert group says that if Beijing can play its part, US trade war pressure could help China in the long run by reducing the dependence of the two countries.
Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, the Ideal Bank, said: "Indeed, the rapid political decisions of Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could start economic downturns in both countries, and they are more dangerous than viewers have ever recognized before".
The foreign minister said Syria was "ready" for the refugees to return.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country after seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is stable and secure because of the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to work to restore the area to its original state.
Now all the situations now point to the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left for terrorism and to the autonomous economic measures that focus on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that he would not accept any aid or conditional support from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States in the final 16.5 points to 10.5 points at the Le Golf National Stadium outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the lead when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson struggled hard in that game, scoring three runs in the 16th hole, and making the score victorious over Francesco Molinari.
Italian grandmaster Molinari performed well in all his rounds, becoming the first player out of four to advance to the final in a 5-0-0 draw after the current format of the tournament had begun in 1979.
The Danish American Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson was defeated 2-1, and England's Ian Poulter was able to play in the Ryder Cup in his final.
Spanish national Sergio Garcia has won eight Ryder Cups and is the all-time career European champion with 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a difficult year.
So thank you, Thomas, for taking me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help", Garcia said enthusiastically following the European victory.
He crossed the finish line to his fellow countryman John Ram, who won the Tiger Woods 2 & 1 knockout title at the championship game on Sunday.
Rahm, 23, said, "The incredible pride I feel about beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy".
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
One exception is one of the greatest players ever, winning 14 major titles in a short time, with only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled over the weekend to find a way out except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the game in the all-star game.
Jim Furyk, the head of the American team, said after a disappointment for his team: "I am proud of these players, they fought hard.
There was this morning when we were putting the tide on the continent.
We gave up.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He was a great team leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to put it back together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be the team leader.
You should raise your hand.
We played better.
