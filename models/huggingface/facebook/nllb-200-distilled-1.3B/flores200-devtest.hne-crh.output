Because dinosaurs did not have a well-developed soft, called a finch, but had other features of the finch - the barb and barbels - researchers speculated that finches were likely to evolve later evolutionarily like other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used in flight but for temperature regulation or performance.The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult wings and is not a female.

It takes a giant rocket 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.

Tigers are in the same group (genus Panhreira) as lions, leopards and jaguars.These are the only four bills that can roar.

The original population has not changed at all, they also need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.

Mosasaurus was the supreme hunter of his time, so it scared nothing but the other Mosasaurs.
Its long jawbone was embedded in its mouth with an extra set of over 70 razor-sharp teeth, meaning that it had no part for anything crossing its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a fork-like tongue. Its diet included lians, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.

Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, wealthy men preferred to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate their meals.
The ancient Roman diet could not include foods that had been brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia over the following centuries.

The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free either.
It was ruled by the &quot;Vichy&quot; French.These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies launched an invasion into southern France, the invasion was called &quot;Operation Dragon&quot;.

A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a significantly larger group of people who peer and work together to create a society.
The term civilisation comes from the Latin civitas, meaning civil, from Latin civitas, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defines the shape of society.

Sustainable agriculture is agriculture that is done solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often biological system, which uses seeds saved for ecoregion in conjunction with crop cycles or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that uniquely determine a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.

Oliver Sachs indicated in his seminal paper The Presidential Speech that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are still able to correctly assess honesty.
He also suggested that such abilities in explaining human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes the variation it expresses from the pool.
The separation and recombination alternation between the two pools varies with each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for primates with digestive systems like humans to meet their high amino-acid needs from available plant resources.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The most easily accessible plant resources are proteins available in leaves and fruits, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest until they are cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (ants, diets, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their own "protein problem" to some extent in the same way as chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during one's normal sleep period and falling asleep some time later (10-60 minutes).

If you stop seeing everything else in your own peripheral vision, or don't see enough motion, staring at a point can effectively cause the same problem.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. The philosophy of the various deities is to cleanse the energy pulses, activate the chakras and create enlightened consciousness.

Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought on battlefields, from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places, by de facto, pseudo-armies.
17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize with the Romanian bridgeheads.

Navies' job has traditionally been to ensure that their countries maintain the ability to move their people and goods, while, at the same time, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of WWII. The Americans were attempting to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, primarily using U-boats, was attempting to intercept this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain, as they had the rest of Europe.

Crossteys to hold tracks in place had been introduced long before. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if there was an iron bar on top.
This became common, but iron made wagons more frictional on wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was launched.
The first known transportation was ongoing, humans having begun walking directly with the emergence of Homo erectus (i.e. the upright man) two million years ago.
They did not walk straight as their predecessor, Australopithecus habitus.

Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue the period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key suggestions that DNA was the only genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transplant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He did two experiments marking DNA or proteins of phases with radioactive phosphorus in phase.
The mutation can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the pieces of genetic material affected and whether or not the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germ-line cells alone can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery including the wildlife of plants and animals.

In developed countries we almost never hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?Are transport engineers just incompetent?Or was something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult as driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers behave within reasonably consistent ranges; thus, the traffic stream has some reasonable constancy and can thus be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
