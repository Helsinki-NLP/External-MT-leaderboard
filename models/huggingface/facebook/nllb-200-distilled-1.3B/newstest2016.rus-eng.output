The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic payment method.
The changes provide for the preservation of the passenger transportation benefit.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing the privileged travel of citizens using the social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region changes.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the privilege of traveling in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 "On the national payment system".
The social card of the resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic payment method.
The conditions of its application are changing accordingly.
Thus, the replenishment limit is now set not in travel, as before, but in the amount of money, keeping the winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now, social card holders will need to track their cash balance on their transport receipts, not the number of trips left.
The cost of a passenger ticket is 1/2 of the carrier's fare.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The calendar for the replenishment of social cards remains the same - from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social card travel arrangements will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep detailed accounts of spending on the social card with a penny accuracy.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the money that has been credited but not spent.
The scheme of inter-compensation with transport companies is also becoming transparent, since now half of the cost of the journey is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the transport company by the budget.
No commission will be charged for card deposits.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivanovo region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using the social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget provides for more than 470 million rubles for providing citizens with a preferential travel permit using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to killing his girlfriend.
During the 911 call, in a voice almost without a shudder, university lecturer Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "dog" in the house that was alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note carelessly handwritten on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it all back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me", the note, signed by Lamb, said.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had made it 300 miles to the university campus by then, where police believe he shot respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university staff learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the school shooting left students and faculty hiding behind locked doors, officials were still trying to piece together the motives behind Lamb's shooting.
The information shared by investigators from both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a portrait of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss was killed, said he had no record of violence or criminal activity.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed his appreciation for the "beautiful people" he encountered in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which had 17 professors, and many students attended lectures from both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something were wrong with him".
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he was coping with stress.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University to grant him a sick leave, saying he had some health issues.
He's only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university hiring rules meant that the doctorate that Lamb had worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb obviously had something on his mind".
Those are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
Police tracked Lamb down after he escaped from campus on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber single-shot pistol in the backyard of his home, a mile south of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with the engine still running was parked on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had come to the house, although Johnson said she believed he knew people who lived there.
Lamb grew up around there.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, fun person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool guy older than her who had been trying to teach her to play guitar for years.
He was a success with women in those years.
All the girls were melting when he was around", says Hairston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have been dating for a while at the time.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Gautier in a brick house that faced the canal.
The police say the dog is fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter, now 19.
"She's really depressed", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he hadn't dated Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both performing at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together occasionally at concerts.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and co-entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit The Julep Room bar in the suburb of Gauthier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5 when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for the small crowd.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the dead teacher, was a first-year teacher who specialized in Native American and colonial American history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight memorial ceremony on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The story was helped by Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettuce in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to police claims that Lamb's 911 call came in after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us is planning to hire fewer employees for the holiday season .
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many employees this holiday season as it did last year, while the toy and children's retailer says it will give full-time and temporary employees the opportunity to work longer hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, down from the 45,000 it hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it would begin interviewing applicants this month and increase staff from October to December.
Although there are still months before the holidays, the shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have enough staff in stores and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about going on a date with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it's like I'm literally an arm's length away from a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" was 30 years ago.
"For me", says Spielberg, "it is without a doubt the greatest time-travel movie ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
In response to Russia's military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says there is "no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and that the increase in arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent council members - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the General Assembly's ministerial session this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation insoluble".
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in resolving the Iran nuclear issue and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
Eight polls that show Donald Trump is not kidding.
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others shrugged off it, thinking it was a joke.
And some of them want a scandal.
But as much as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high polling position, they have failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead in double digits, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul in terms of his chances of getting nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance of getting the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising popularity of Herman Kane, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would run for office.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Political Activity Super Committee and the economic conservative Growth Club recognize Trump's unwavering strength and are beginning to pour their dollars into toppling him.
Here are some survey figures that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a mid-life crisis:
Trump's approval ratings have gone up by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University found that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these things are dominating in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would have Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "delighted" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two in 10 say they'd be "upset" if he ran.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would "like" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in the class of delight?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "displeased" or "disappointed" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush were to run.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his boasting and insulting, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationwide think the tycoon has the temperament to be president, an ABC News/Washington post poll showed Monday.
The same figure is showing up at the nation's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the man who could be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he's not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament is not right for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to that idea.
When they put on their connoisseur hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was the front-runner, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's not the case anymore when four out of 10 were on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn't have the right magic crystal before.
Meanwhile, in the last cycle of the cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the likely candidate, Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign compelling.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that this spread is likely to play to Trump's advantage, and that those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
A recent poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins the support of the majority.
He's 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 ahead of Walker, 19 ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's outran him?
Ben Carson beat the businessman by a whopping 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one contest.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump voters say they are confident in their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he'll never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has become the most talked about topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's posturing will turn key Latino voters away from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration is a global issue, it looks like Donald Trump will stay the same.
Disillusionment with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
SIX out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll on Monday said they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also upset with Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican performance in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "angry".
The government will decide the fate of the pension indexation in October.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, reports the Russian Government.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, when the draft budget for next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the accumulated pension of Russians.
The Hungarian noted that the pension savings amount to 350 billion rubles.
That's about the same as indexing the pension in full for next year.
According to the deputy prime minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Hunger believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why do they often get irritated and blush?
The doctor-ophthalmologist Tatyana Levasova answers:
Our eyelids are like a screen that protects the eyeball from a multitude of tiny particles that settle on them.
Forgetting to clean our eyes regularly often contributes to the development of bluff.
The way out is simple:
Do not wipe your eyes with dirty hands, and carry a special wet eyelid wipes.
Clean the edges of your eyelids at least once or twice a day from the accumulated pollutants.
Cleansing procedures should be supplemented with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (shalfey, chamomile), which dilute the thick secretion of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the finger pads;
When washing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to the thickening of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have developed a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities say the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, is operating at "full capacity".
The news was published on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency.
The report said the DPRK was ready to respond to "US aggression and nuclear threat" at any time and that the country had improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality".
The last nuclear test was conducted by North Korea in 2013.
At the same time, no plans to resume full-scale operation of the reactor have been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims to have developed a nuclear warhead.
The DPRK has also repeatedly tested medium- and short-range missiles, according to polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of brotherly peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a State Duma meeting, reports "Russian news service".
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it", said Zhirinovsky.
The deputy believes that all four-letter words containing this line should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God save the king", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is convinced that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe will take in refugees or not, but whether we must address the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans care about refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists.
That's our view on this problem.
"That's the essence of the refugee issue", he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
But if we want real success, it cannot be achieved while people are dying, while bloodshed continues and until people feel completely safe.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria", Assad said.
Recall that this year, about 500,000 migrants arrived in the European Union, including from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis is the world's largest since World War II.
Thousands of Islamic State militants may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organisation banned in Russia can use the situation to set up their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The residents of a German town have organized a celebration for refugees.
Germany has been the leader in the last month in accepting refugees, although it has recently tightened border controls to stem the influx.
Authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts put the numbers much higher.
More than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country since the beginning of September.
BBC reporter Jenny Hill visited Darmstadt, a city where migrants are welcomed with great enthusiasm.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut in the Prime Minister 's Question Session .
After Mr. Corbin 's election , his debut at the Prime Minister 's Questions Session is eagerly awaited .
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon address the Prime Minister's Question Session for the first time, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions in the afternoon, likely to be closely watched by the press and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he might miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader; it comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual trade union congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the national anthem at his service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative MPs and was the subject of several front page newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbin 's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention .
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he had "stood in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have declined to play for Mr Corbyn, voicing disagreements over economic, defence and international policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "stacking up" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and the government's cut in compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn told a trade union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments to remove the idea of restrictions altogether.
A few hours later Mr Smith, the shadow Minister for Labour and Pensions, said there was "full clarity" in the party that it was only in opposition to the government's plans to cut the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has met at the courier box in the 10 years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "engaged collective resources" to get questions for Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 proposals.
The MP for Islington North said the Prime Minister's questions were too confrontational and that he would refrain from both witty answers and ranting, vowing instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Economy Secretary, will be filling in for him on questions to the Prime Minister when he is away - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak when possible, saying he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to discuss the issue.
Upon becoming leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the "fairground" political style often associated with the question-and-answer procedure to the prime minister, but admitted years later that he had failed to do so.
Since first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of a leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons and reputation with other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.

The pound is rising as wages rise in Britain
The pound rose on the back of rising wages in the UK, while the FTSE 100 index rose thanks to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, UK earnings, minus bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was met as a move to an earlier date for forecasts of possible price increases.
The pound sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index has risen to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
On the overall backdrop, SABMiller shares stood out, which rose by 20% thanks to a bid from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world's two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% on the back of encouraging news from rival luxury goods maker Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures have exceeded all expectations and show that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - have started to rise again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares of paper and packaging group Mondi were the leaders in the 4.3% drop in the index after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group's rating to "sell".
JD Sports shares rose after the sportswear supplier reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax profits in the six months to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hinder expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Coghill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But such purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the rising cost of labor, he says.
The costs could affect JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi's onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier has launched a bottom-up campaign to protect IGA's market share in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi's upcoming $700 million investment.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash supermarkets and IGA are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in the mainstream media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is being joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as Simmo's ice cream maker from Dunsborough, which offers tasting at IGA stores, and shop owners who sell discounted tickets to regular customers for South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29 - the day when this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as IGA branded stores in South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known to be familiar with the routes, so the market here is more favourable for IGA retailers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - over 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in those two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kirath estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales this year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Africa and 30 in Western Australia next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million respectively in these markets.
The loss of revenue and food sales at a high level of Metcash's ongoing costs could cost the company about $13 million in pre-interest and tax revenues, Mr. Kirat said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, and that's despite a recent study by Morgan Survey finding IGA to have the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business luncheon in Melbourne that Metcash "could very well disappear within a decade.
Metcash has declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is believed that a member of Metcash's board of directors contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18 to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash's revenue from the food business, which the company supplies to IGA's approximately 1,200 retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012 due to operational deleveraging and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company is not giving up, spending over $150 million annually to bring retail prices up to the Coles and Woolworths prices at 1,000 locations a week and helping IGA retailers redesign their retail locations, as well as offering a rapidly expanding fresh produce range and a wider selection of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price equalization and retail space redevelopment are gaining momentum, and he hopes the company will see net profit increase in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyrios and deserves more credit than criticism for his behavior, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo and often referred to as the "Special Ks", was unwittingly thrust into the spotlight by Kyrios's infamous feud with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after, during a heated qualifier in Cincinnati, the referee on the turf had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating, "The chip should have been on Cyrus's shoulder blades, and I should have been on this guy's shoulder blades".
Ever since Cockinac was last seen breaking a racket after a leg cramp saved Richard Gasquet from a possible loss at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Cockinac.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second behind Bernard Tomic in the singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm very concerned about is that Tanasi has been dragged into the conflict", Healy said.
He did break his racket when he lost his foot at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his racket when he got disappointed, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of that.
But he's actually handled himself very well in some pretty provocative situations in the US, with Harrison and so on, and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, he fits in well with the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected off the court, he's been training hard, he's in great shape, he's a very determined and developed young man, and I think he should be valued.
Healy also supported the decision to pardon Kyrios for the important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" was the right way out for everyone, but hoping the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to be fully focused on the match, not on the arguments around [Kirios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing in the public eye, he's made some serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to take him out of the spotlight for a while so he can reflect on them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, closing its southern border with Serbia and detaining those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
There were riots at the border, with hundreds of migrants clustered on the border, which was met with a sharp negative reaction from the Serbian authorities.
Trapped indefinitely on a road between the two countries' checkpoints, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland set up tents and settled in the area.
However, the discontent grew.
As a police helicopter circled overhead, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared it "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not a side effect.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after the 28-nation bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed hope that an agreement could be reached in the future (next month or by the end of the year) to allow EU member states to take in another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary, however, does not expect quick action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijartó said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to stem the flow of migrants across the country now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were being brought on board to complete the urgent work of fencing the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major "narrow point" and border crossing point for EU migrants, many of whom are refugees from wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees - victims of war who are entitled to protection, a view that is at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which took effect at midnight in Hungary, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for those accused of human trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We're making it clear that crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to approve the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are on the border have been seeing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
Deirdre Bacondi, Orban's national security adviser, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border at the border and 15 more inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence and are currently in police custody charged with administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are rebuilding the fence quickly.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, bringing a railway car wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the crossings.
The riots broke out at the main border crossing near the city of Ryoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed a service room to let people through inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would not eat or drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernard Sanders has halved in a national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race nationwide, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is receiving the support of 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
With more than five months to go before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say whether they've decided which candidate to support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than other candidates.
Since CBS News' poll last month, Clinton has lost support among some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton has a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has diminished.
Her male support has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters under 50 is gone, and they're on a par with Sanders now.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was two-digit ahead of Sanders among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, current Clinton supporters are more likely to be enthusiastic about her.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, the views are more mixed - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the experience (16 percent), then that it is time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called a consensus on questions and chances of being elected.
As the vice president considers a potential run, 57 percent of primary Democratic voters would like him to join the race - though a third think he shouldn't.
When asked who they would like to see run second in the Democratic primary, primary voters mostly name Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run as a Democrat, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
Yet when asked what matters most about a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options than the odds of being elected.
Similar to last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are unacceptable to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, performed well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden leads the three in honesty, and Clinton's strength is her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him on that.
Democratic primary voters also generally see similar ideological views among Clinton, Sanders and Biden.
By all these measures, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton's personal email and server while she was Secretary of State continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe it has not negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But it's a different story for the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the story became public.
Most Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party voters, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month and 15 points lower than in May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters nationwide don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, are getting good marks for leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush have the best honesty scores.
Most people see Sanders as more of an honest person than not, but like Carson, many people have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
According to a national poll, Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll.
These two candidates won half the votes in a new poll, leaving everyone else looking for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in droves, with his approval rating rising from 23 percent in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent in a poll conducted Tuesday.
But Carson's shot up from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoys support across all demographic groups, outpacing Trump in the college-educated Republican voter group.
The other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, have rolled back, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus-minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson rising in the polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's support surging last week, Trump made several critical attacks on the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during the closing of his Iowa campaign.
Five fraternity members are charged in the death of a freshman at Baruch College .
About two years after a college student was killed during a fraternity initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chan "Michael" Deng during a dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to get him to the hospital in time, resulting in his death", police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student, carrying a 30-pound backpack with sand on his back, was pushed several times as he tried to reach his goal on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity failed to call 911 when Deng lost consciousness and waited an estimated hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the fraternity members began to hide personal belongings, essentially putting the fraternity's well-being ahead of Michael Deng's health", said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered multiple blunt force injuries to the head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered from fraternity initiation rituals, with at least one student killed each year since 1970", said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County jury's favoring third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with assault on a rookie and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but if there is an organization that has authorized all this, officially or unofficially, then her too", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded the local chapter from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
If rates go up, the bull market will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take to attack, and how long it will last.
In economics, in particular, history has little to say about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a full 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's toughness in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
That's why the Fed administration is so insistent that investors should focus not on when it starts raising rates, but on how long it takes to adapt.
Actually, there are a lot of variables in play.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that the hype surrounding the rate hike is overblown.
"The Federal Reserve's first rate hike in the wake of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said in a client commentary.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic momentum that many fear.
That doesn't mean there won't be consequences, though.
Here's a look at how some sectors of the economy might have responded to historical trends:
As we've seen in the market over the last month or so, expecting rates to rise can lead to volatility for a while.
When rates are raised, however, the consequences are usually not as dramatic.
"Equity returns do not appear to have slowed for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a slowdown in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes.
Specifically, the market has changed more sharply over the past 35 years or so - about 14 percent - to a rate hike, remained fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then returned to normal after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock trading strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the yield for securities tends not to be immediately more pronounced when rates rise and equity returns start to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often play into them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that have never existed before and could accelerate a recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the entire time the rate has been raised.
Deutsche Bank claims that in 118 cases since 1950, only twice has nominal annual GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last long, with the third quarter holding at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in such a volatile economic environment can be risky and raises the question "will it be different this time", Deutsche reported.
Market participants have been preparing for the Federal Reserve's rate hike all year, with their eyes fixed on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could have approved a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading only suggests a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, all the rate-rising cycles since 1950 to date have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage in GDP, overlapping pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery began", the report says.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has waited for since the end of the last recession, a record 35 months, and it's been going on for 74 months.
Fixed income has also become volatile as the market expects rates to rise, and this scenario is in some ways similar to what is being realized for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for stocks when the Federal System changes strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that yields change vector immediately after the first rate hike/lower in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of interest rate hikes, bond yields immediately fall", reports Deutsche.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring long-term and short-term bond yields closer together, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, although "we still fear fluctuations in yields", says Kathy Jones, a research analyst at Schwab Fixed Income.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adjusted to the expected outcomes of the Federal System's policies.
"In addition to the strengthening dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have gone up, yield curves are flatter, credit spreads have widened, volatility has increased -- all market characteristics with the tightening of Federal system policies.
Generally speaking, companies that do their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be worse off because the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks perform better than the market for three months after the initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client report.
The companies with stable financial positions outperformed the companies with unstable positions on average by 5 percentage points for each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
High-yield companies and low-volatility stocks also performed better than low-quality stocks, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will be a big issue.
The companies with the highest floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
Beyond purely stock trading, consumers will benefit from a rising dollar.
Investors could see a return also through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM", says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the station for "lowering standards".
It proves that it's becoming less and less distinctive from its commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply taken away from the Brits.
My colleague Damien Collins, who raided The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming Classic FM", said the leader of MPs, urging the broadcaster to prove it does something commercial companies don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it seemed the public radio station was "going crazy" and becoming less and less distinctive from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are the first two examples that came to mind where you're actually just copying what's already on the market", Mr Bingham said.
The BBC's director general has rejected the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will never learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performance and music creation is truly unmatched.
"It's also really important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC outfit to be attacked for tapping the heels of commercial competitors during a special Culture, Media and Sport Committee hearing.
Tory MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
See why this program is often criticized for its lack of originality and distinctiveness?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" the next time it launched an entertainment project.
However, he does not see the need to prevent future seasons of The Voice from being ordered or license fee money from being used for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed in August, and Black Friday may be to blame.
Online sales increased seven percent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the slowest growth since records began in 2000.
Online sales picked up three years ago due to mobile device use for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could have helped curb spending.
For about a decade, online shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain's central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of easing online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping spending in August showed the lowest growth since records began in 2000, increasing by just five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of easing online sales after the latest data showed a mere seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they always had a reasonable explanation", Andy Malcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales boomed three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to shop online, and that they could do so in any environment, like sitting on a couch.
But now it's coming to a plateau, and you can see a decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that shoppers may have been holding back on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers rushed to the computer to grab a bargain, bringing down a number of seller websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers are in a real battle for bargain purchases, could make people refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £1 in every 5 is spent online.
As for such items as televisions and washing machines, more than a third are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are more likely to buy clothes and shoes online than in high street fashion stores.
Muslims bury the crane victims in Mecca, and sanctions are in place on bin Laden's family
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies through the streets as first burial begins in Mecca
At the same time , Saudi Arabia has placed some of the blame for the accident on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group .
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims of the crane collapse at Mecca's main mosque.
The funeral procession, mostly dressed in white, filled the driveway to pay their respects to the first of the dead to make their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the holy site where a construction crane had pierced the ceiling of the mosque and fallen on the congregation just days earlier.
The bodies were given for burial, and at the same time the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the bin Laden family for the crash, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 people who died in the crane collapse at the main mosque were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was a father of four, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arrow up when the crane was down.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press, says the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not give details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane fell into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go on the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group has not made any statements about the crane collapse, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and not properly coordinating with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca, as part of a massive construction project being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been a close ally of the Saudi ruling family for decades and has been responsible for some of the largest construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a traitorous son whose family disowned him in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in heavy rain and wind just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory for every able-bodied Muslim at least once in a lifetime.
Officials say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have ordered a payment of one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount to the irreparably injured.
The rest of the victims will get half of that.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repairmen
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores nationwide.
Author: Rupert Steiner, chief city correspondent for the Daily Mail
They say the British put aside their hammers and paintbrushes and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you can use a hammer or paint walls, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because, according to the company that owns B&Q, Brits are increasingly hiring skilled craftsmen to do simple housework.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, a home improvement company, said the trend was driven by a significant influx of skilled craftspeople from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores specializing in craftsman goods, and simultaneously close 60 B&Q warehouse stores.
Ms. Lori said she would like to see more women on the staff at B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the weaker sex.
Most of the staff are men.
She said that recent demographic trends are also noticeable, with more single women in households taking on more responsibility for their homes than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said: "Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions about what we buy are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women at the helm of Britain's top FTSE100 companies, has also changed the composition of her top management team to include equal numbers of women and men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company where exactly 50 percent of the executives are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Lori said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is important to us.
Finding suitable women on the board was not difficult.
After the group took over the closing costs, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, is opening 200 new stores.
Time of decision on the US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank hold a meeting where they discuss for two days the most important decision of their lives - whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would go ahead last week now believe it will delay and keep rates in the current 0-0.25 percent range.
This is a historic event, because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the point where a central bank can move from zero to a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is doing well, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
But the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact this decision will have on the global economy.
He warned the markets to prepare for change, but all signs point to their belief that the odds are against it.
The decision will be announced at 8:00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" hundreds of refugees chant at the Khorgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Budapest closed the border to immigrants on Tuesday.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to see other routes to the European Union.
One of them is through Romania, bypassing the closed border with Serbia.
The other one, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that were taking refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of Šidou on the Croatian border.
The drivers have been ordered by the authorities to continue without stopping.
Serbia's Interior Minister Nebojša Stepanović assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is a European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe can do it alone, especially a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone claims to be a refugee, they have to fill out the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed in our country, because Serbia is perfectly safe.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not going to stop there: he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already declared that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vanheels Meimarakis: "Europe is willing to help us".
Vangelis Maymarakis was part of a right-wing government that left the country in financial crisis.
Now, as interim leader of the New Democracy party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist from Euronews.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to the Euronews!
VANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: Thank you for having me.
Evron News: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat to the Syriza coalition, but now, according to the polls, New Democracy has equaled it in popularity.
What's changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country is back to a budget deficit and high unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them out.
Over the last nine months, the Greek people have had the opportunity to assess the situation the country was in in January and Mr Tsipras' false promises.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse than in January, when the situation was improving, and this was true for most Greek citizens.
Evronus: But you say that if you win the elections you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The point is that, as we have learned over the years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no accident that in all the other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still being implemented, political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement the programme they have agreed upon, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you keep this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
VANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: We actually voted for Greece to move on the European path because we have a good idea of the devastating consequences of leaving the EU.
Europe is helping us now by providing subsidies to our farmers for their produce, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and help in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if it weren't for the treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of Mr Tsipras' negotiating methods.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So if Europe sees that the new Greek government within the first year of its mandate wants to bring order, acts rationally and shows that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout programme, then I am sure that all the commitments that have been made that cannot be fulfilled because they are leading to recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to think that in the first year of the new agreement we can return to negotiations with our creditors, because they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to reap the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of what farmers' incomes are.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never spoke of this.
So the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and so they failed to negotiate and they failed to make a deal.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I'll explain to them that by the end of 2014, we tried to do our best to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners.
We've been pushing reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market plummeted, and there were no potential buyers to pay the price the Greek government was willing to pay.
I was then speaker of the parliament, and I was able to coordinate the views of the three parliamentary groups that made up the majority in the government at the time.
And despite their major ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and that was in the presence of populists and extremists, and mass demonstrations outside.
And we've managed to get the country back to normal, which would have continued to improve if the process hadn't been interrupted by the early general election that resulted in the presidential election in December.
Evron News: A massive influx of refugees has been moving through Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of European countries to what these people are trying to achieve?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we will have to deal with after we win the election.
And the reason is that the Syriza government didn't act in this situation the way it should have.
You have to be quick about things like this, because if a problem hits you, then there's only emergency measures.
And that's exactly where we are now.
Even the interim government that replaced Syriza did more in just seven days than Mr Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is being helped by the president of the republic, who called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice, refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some emergency that happened to them.
This issue has a profoundly humanitarian dimension and we will be taking the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centers.
We must also make effective use of the economic aid we receive from the EU to be able to tackle this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for your interview.
VANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: Thank you very much for that.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka in the Donetsk region, during the day, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Main Directorate of the police of the region together with military counterintelligence identified and detained a suspect, a 34-year-old Ukrainian military serviceman from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who on the eve of the evening during the joint consumption of alcoholic beverages and the conflict in the village of Verhnetersky of the Yasynovatsky district of Donetsk, shot his opponent from an automatic.
A 22-year-old male was reported injured at the hospital, where he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the leg.
According to Artem Vasitski, deputy chief of the Criminal Investigation Department of the police head of the region, during the course of the operational actions, the law enforcement authorities proved the involvement of the defendant in another serious criminal offence - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The investigators found that the suspect and another local resident had a fight that day, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the man's head.
The investigation department of the Druzhkovsky Municipal District has opened criminal proceedings under the articles "Deliberate murder" and "Deliberate infliction of serious bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The suspect faces up to 15 years in prison.
The suspect was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, the press service of the Donetsk region police said.
Two residents of Novosibirsk who painted several Soviet monuments, including two to Vladimir Lenin, in the colors of the Ukrainian flag have been sentenced to prison by a Russian court.
Two other city residents were sentenced to prison terms.
The inmates of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received 14 and 18 months' imprisonment.
The Lenin court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin's monuments, which were located on the territory of the KPRF regional committee and on the street of the Tricotazhny, as well as the memorial complex "Monument of Glory".
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile system and the T-34 tank were painted.
On the night of December 12, in Novosibirsk, Russia, unknown persons painted military equipment on the Glory Monument in the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
The civil wife of popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsyganov, Irina Leonova, has given birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are both fine.
Let's remember, recently, the Gypsies and Leonova broke up.
Eugene declined to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions.
Yevgeny Gyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater "Petra Fomenko's Workshop".
He is known for the films "Promenade", "Cosmos as a foreboding", "Brest Fortress", "Ottepel" and "Farts" series.
On September 8, Yevgeny Tsyganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note apologizing.
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" about the first murder and wanted to "get it all back", authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gauthier, Mississippi, say a geography and social science professor at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He reported, "I killed my wife last night", and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house that "won't hurt anyone", but was probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he wouldn't say.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
Upon arrival at the scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said, "I'm sorry, I'd like to return everything.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and then on Monday night, surrounded by police, he killed himself.
University president William LaForge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb was suggesting an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials on Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they're still friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, 19, who was "uncomfortable".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the Sun Herald calls Prentiss' close friend, Prentiss worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people".
Police say Lamb called his family at some point on Monday to say he "won't go to jail".
That evening, when police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the university's website, Lamb received his Ph.D. in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor was also reportedly suffering from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is out for a couple of months with a double fracture .
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about the incident, which will keep him out of the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless under-kick in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw stormed into PSV's penalty area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture and he's in the hospital".
He's being flown to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then he's going to have surgery.
It's terrible, a young man came to Manchester United at 18, overcame a lot of difficulties and started playing fantastically, and this happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
That was a very bad two-legged jump.
In a tweet, Shaw wrote, "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how devastated I am, my journey to recovery is beginning, I will come back even stronger than I was".
On the subject: Manchester United are having a misfortune with Luke Shaw in their loss to PSV .
The English defender will have an extra incentive to prepare for the European Championship in France next June.
Philip Kokku, PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury".
When any player goes down with an injury like that, everybody's really upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands squad at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's in a very difficult position right now because he had no intention of hurting the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you don't feel good", Koko said.
I didn't get to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he was touching it, but I didn't see the undertow under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it's like, I know how hard it is to bear.
It's very hard, and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: If your child likes a book, it will take a while before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron, I guess.
When asked by a company that runs a children's holiday home about his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, an environmental fairy tale written by Dr Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This is a funny, moving, unusual story with a strong message that I love to read to my kids because it always has some image or message that we miss".
And it would be fine, except for the last paragraph, where Cameron supposedly retells the book's content, but actually tells the story of the 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify the fairly short original narrative.
"In the high-walled town of Seamusville, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by granting her wish to see a real tree", reads the description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough, Cameron's line reads almost like a summary of the plot of The Lorax, posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled town of Wemyssville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
It seems unlikely that Cameron, an admittedly active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about the environmental destruction of greedy logger and "all-nuts" knitter Nahodkins, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is carried in the book's title) - a funny mustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees".
It's likely that such a simple PR assignment was given to a performer who had never read a Lorax book to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's office, but no further comment followed.
For Adam Leith, there was clearly a risk of missing out on England's national team, but it's still a tough question.
Winning against Pakistan in the UAE is not an easy task, but if you look at the team England have selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test defeat that happened last time doesn't seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out winning on my own court, either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has players in the backfield who are great at catching curveballs and a strong team spirit; they won't bring back the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moen Ali becomes a bowler who delivers curveballs, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
On another subject, Adam Leath has been dropped from the England Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to dismiss Adam Leith is, of course, difficult for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, to analyse.
His seven Tests have seen two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because, as I said before, players are best to choose themselves.
A couple hundred and fifty, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he scores more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, spoke highly of his spirit, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first and then everything else.
The question of how long it will be before a Test cricket batsman makes an impression is a difficult one.
Lee played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Compton was the only one who got a chance to play on his own court and on someone else's.
The only thing you can complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Leith were at their best, but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman I really appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but that will depend, of course, on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow for the addition of an extra spinner while keeping four fast bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see why a batsman can't get the ball back there and this left-hander has already shown he's a hell of a cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what you need for your Worcestershire county, but he's number three for them, and there's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests as a third-row before he retired as an opening batsman in 2001.
He won 300 right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansar is coming to the national team as a reserve spinner, and in my brief conversation with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his average stats -- 31 at bat and 35 with the ball -- and think that's a risky bet, but there's a small minority of spinners who vote yes, and the selectors chose youth.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England are planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointing Mahella Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a Test match advisor could be a masterful move.
He's one of the best guys for the game, who will bring to it the richest experience gained in any possible environment and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is in the white ball game and will provide both energy and a relentless pace in the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and like Mahelo, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they're saying what's been said before, can give a new strength to the team.
Durham's teammates Ben Stokes is on a one-day break, Ruth is on a similar break due to Australia, and I, for one, have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and players' selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
These decisions are never made lightly.
Brexit could win if the economy is in recession by 2017
David Cameron's ill-advised policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is getting more difficult every day, even without looking at the election of the brilliant Jeremy Corbyn - "Is it yes or no?" - as Labour leader or the TUC's anger over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbins and Nigella Farage, too.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that with the EU in a state of crisis - not all of it self-inflicted - some member states are fed up with the British agenda of self-serving concessions and undermining the changes they do not want.
Gathering in Brighton for their annual meeting, the TUC decided they didn't want them anyway if they were destroying social security.
We could even call it the Dave and George selfie program.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves against a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity, and then come home and say they're attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the European Union's umbrella - "Don't leave us with France", says Berlin - suggests that the shaky ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's most cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before the situation gets worse for her, as it has for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande is up for re-election or a new term in 2017.
He's losing his strength, too.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to see them going out of their way to help the self-obsessed Britons whose energy could be spent on stopping Scotland from leaving the UK - which they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to fuel the process of Britain leaving the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value from the resumption of negotiations".
Europeans, unfortunately, know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the media moguls are of the EU, unlike the time of the 1975 Tony Benn referendum that backed our accession in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a deeply rooted Euro-opportunist who became famous for his "EU banana-straight" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse company of tax-averse crooks, foreign phone hackers and pseudo-nonresidents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt the same way about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a wild gorilla, you should give it bananas to distract it and not let it eat you at lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Miliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair had compromised on principle in favour of the abrogated EU constitution, buried by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him the winning ticket.
The press never forgave him for any of it.
But my friend Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't have any more time to waste on me - seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch' strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy for dealing with the press -- not me, but definitely Andrew Marr, whose couch he sat on Sunday in the Air Force.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I'm delicately calling evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional Zionist trend of Ukip and the wider circle of "Little Englanders" among the Tories can probably say yes to this.
That's exactly what Hillary- "Benn, but not Bennite" -Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner Boy Scout struggling to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the obnoxious John McDonnell as "shadow" Treasury Secretary was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old man fought hard on TV for disloyalty to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet post.
The Battle of Hilari was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "at all costs" - a phrase Bennet used - is not what McDonnell said, and it is not what J.K. said to the peers and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in the general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his "boyfriend" Corbyn wants to say -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of messaging remains important in an age of 24-hour, seven-day-a-week television, and especially in the social media maelstrom, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is wise not to let Cameron get away with Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks that.
But the basic misconception of MacDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership - within the framework of a "Bennitic" fortress economy - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by a minor difference, is central to dogmatic debates.
As for his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson, there's no question that J.K. will not campaign for an exit, and foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to get that to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on British concessions when it might be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak British military actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government in power is cutting spending, as I was reminded of Monday at a lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of e-cigarettes by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's claims that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released a landmark report last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these claims were "solid or flimsy".
Martin McKeigh, a lecturer in European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Cappwell, a lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health care is that rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on detailed analysis of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is from a single meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a model of multi-criteria decision analysis to summarize their views on the harm of different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Cappwell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
It also confirmed BAT certificates in the health sector in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
No rational explanation was given for the board's selection, but there are several prominent e-cigarette advocates among them, some of whom also stated their industry funding in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants in the meeting have any experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco section at PHE.
The scientific paper published by the group "agrees elegantly" that there is a lack of "strong evidence of harmful effects of most foods on most criteria", wrote McKee and Cappwell.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Cappwell said PHE's claims that "there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are a road to smoking for children or non-smokers" are premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the BMJ had previously responded to the claims.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking tobacco".
One of the two lifelong smokers died from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not prove, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly stating the obvious - that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only a fraction of the harm of smoking - we are fulfilling our mission to the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 thinks the BBC should stop EastEnders.
Former Channel 4 chief Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would have paid a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson noted that the licence fees should only be used to produce programmes not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably watched by only a small part of the audience, on peak airtime, when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to collaborate more with other organisations, Johnson noted that he had tried unsuccessfully to establish a partnership with the BBC during his six years at Channel 4.
"I can't shake the thought that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasting programmes that could be shown by competing companies that don't receive subsidies", Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC's future.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should only keep on air those programs that aren't being produced and aren't going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice is airing in prime time because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't see why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; they are known to be self-produced.
Other channels would have paid a lot for it, no doubt.
I don't see how this is public broadcasting.
I don't think it would have degraded the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the staff and their belief that it is the best way to gain long-term support".
His comments on the most popular shows on the BBC echo those of Sky's executive director Tony Ball, who in his 2003 memorial lecture in Edinburgh suggested the BBC sell EastEnders-type series.
Johnson noted that the BBC's more niche public service broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where often you can't judge the audience, but the company's function is done, and this can be put forward as an argument in the haggling sermons justifying the £4 billion in licence fee revenue: 'well, yes, of course we do all these confusing shows that nobody watches.'
They put them in a slot where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the royalty, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a lot of money, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder, they think that because they don't really watch or listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider the mission of Rita in favour of "inform, educate and entertain".
He noted that only a small fraction of BBC material is now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio - and that the company should embrace the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain".
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that the BBC should do more in areas such as "Promenade Concerts" (only a fraction of which, he said, is shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
Sonogenetics allows you to control brain cells with sound waves.
The video shows how nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses too loud for the human ear to hear.
The pulses act by activating neurons that have been genetically engineered to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound.
Also on the topic: Researchers control brain activity with light
The worms demonstrate the potential of a new technique called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to excite specific brain, heart, and muscle cells from outside the body.
Srikant Chalsani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasanni found that they did when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrated the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are connected to them, reports a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that could be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was used to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into worms' bodies, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in optogenetics, a new field that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that reaches the right part of the brain via fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves travel through the body's tissues without having to travel inside the skull.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses could temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound", said Chalasani.
He added that the technique could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International protesting the arms exhibition.
These are killer drones!
The iron chains that break the calves!
The cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and animation make it clear that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a sickening travesty, prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" weapons against repressive regimes by using the ExCeL exhibition of defence technology and security systems in Docklands.
Also on the topic: DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes are coming to London
But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a lot of posters at bus stops and subway trains that demand to be looked at again.
"Important announcement for DLR from September 15 to 18?" one of them says in London Metro fonts with a picture of the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September this year, a mob of arms dealers will be swarming the DLR line, asking passengers to help stop the arms show.
300 posters were painted by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Park Dismalland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them around London using a "brick-and-mortar set", a 6-pound set of key chains that is claimed to "give access to about a third of the world's bus station advertising space".
London's transport authorities are not happy about the "vandalism" of unauthorised posters.
One of the spoof ads released by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and are seeking to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to make an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms fair, welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the pro bono agency VCCP, with the help of a graphic designer and voiceover artist who also work for free.
Matt Lever, creative director of the VCCP, was struck by the publicity silence surrounding the arms show -- with a pass in the ExCel calendar -- and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They thought of creating more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "filling her houses with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting".
"They have been incredibly helpful in bringing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that these torture devices are not illegally sold right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of arms comes from within ExCeL, where participants sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order for the "AT4CS RS shoulder-firing rifle" from the US Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative warhead that delivers unmatched reserve action into the target".
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved into the dorm as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the long smiles of those I've irritated - and the many, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can range from a little nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It encourages you to talk, to tell people where you're from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin and why you're "honestly, I don't like or hate Marmite, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be home".
You need to rest.
And help others to relax too by asking questions and showing interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes caught fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's bedrooms are often turned into bars, midnight movie theaters, and social gathering places, but they are also places where people dress and fix their underwear.
On a related note, don't even think about starting college while you're in a relationship.
Introverts are treated unfairly in universities.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories create a culture of moving from room to room, which fosters friendship, communication, and long-term friendships.
It can be hell for someone trying to regain their strength.
There's nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep you as my friend, but I need you to leave so I can regain the energy I spent hanging out with you".
Try to sense when a classmate is tired of talking - and instead of knocking, text him.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One guy in my dorm had this rule: If the door was unlocked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you're starting your college life at the peak of the Bake-Off, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate chip cookies is not so weird, it's not so 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I baked you something, now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions".
Making home-cooked meals is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obligated to talk to you, and your face will likely come as a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blended lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to get yourself some milk for tea?
You're gonna have to deal with the milk man.
He will likely suggest that you be open-minded, even if you feel angry.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you, but try to be more mature about it than my roommate who poured dishwasher liquid into her milk to get back at those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You must not make noise that will interfere with people sleeping or studying.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people from the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked a neighbor to turn down the drum and bass because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had a test in the morning.
The neighbor turned up the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, then handed him her music and locked the door behind her, heading off for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse moved into the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, elbow-bitingly awkward if you mistakenly assumed your neighbor for your future spouse, became obsessed with him, broke off the relationship and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull all your mutual friends over to his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart to do anything, but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your temper a little.
In that exciting moment when you realize that someone left their keys inside their own locked room, the line between a draw and a bully is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you can put in the freezer - but don't stick your Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after Apple releases an update
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, your phone will let you download and install it.
Some have experienced problems after installation when they get an error message telling them that "Application update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the animation is gone or try updating via iTunes.
The phone tips will help you get through the whole process.
The process may involve removing apps to increase free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the process with a special utility that suggests removing apps and reinstalling them once the process is complete.
Make sure your phone is charged or near the charger when you update to prevent battery drainage.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as discharging the phone in the process may cause the update to fail.
iOS 9 is coming on schedule despite the delay WatchOS Review iOS 9: the least impressive and best iOS 9 update: how to prepare for the new operating system for iPhone
You should make sure you check our checklist of things to do before you download to try and make something stop going wrong and protect yourself from that something if it goes wrong. iOS 9 now includes new features, including an improved personal assistant and innovations to improve iPad performance, as well as settings to speed things up and fix the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
According to him, Moscow's military support for President Assad only leads to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the White House chief is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, PJ Media reports.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that continued Russian support for President Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively impacting our common goal of combating extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power", the State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the U.S. commitment to fight the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the United States "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State".
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a phone call with President Putin is in our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call".
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime a "losing bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that this was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make things worse.
"But he ignored my warnings - and the situation got worse", the president said.
The imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating vessels for recreation and sport from paying customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on the instructions of the Russian government.
This was reported to "Izvestie" by the assistant of the Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergencies, the FSB, the Federal Trade Commission, the Rosturism - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their ships abroad - about €200 million a year goes to the European treasury for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "About making changes to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes", which provides for full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to creating favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - noted Lashkina.
This issue was submitted to the subcommission on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which held its meeting in September, and was also approved by the departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure on full conditional exemption when importing is in essence a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the subcommission meeting in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activity and international cooperation, to be used in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, to provide international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control-measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports flying machines, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious rituals.
The press service of the Russian Transport Ministry told "Izvesti" that they have prepared mandatory regulations for the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatorium, which provide for a simplified procedure for entering and leaving small, sport sailing and cruise ships in the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has given instructions to the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for entry of small-sized, sport sailing and cruise ships into the seaport and exit of these ships from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared the draft of the Russian government's orders on the approval of the borders of the sea ports of Crimea.
The orders regarding Yalta and Feodosia have already been adopted, the others are in the process of being agreed, the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out state supervision, classification and certification, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia, yachting is extremely difficult precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there's a whole industry that's constantly evolving, and a lot of people are involved.
In Russia, everything is practically in place.
Our coast is uninteresting, the only part where you can sail year-round is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big problem is that the border patrol is very strict in this area, and you need a lot of permits to go out on a yacht.
Besides, inside Russia, the yacht has no place to refuel.
It can run for two days with its own fuel, and then the problem arises where to get it", says Nordmarine sales director Denis Novikov.
As for the storage places for yachts, there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine to develop the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", the statement said.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Tsimao Fan said banking sector reforms would help revive lending in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fan urges the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asking for separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council under the Federal Penal Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestite people in colonies.
This was reported by the member of the Council Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not determined their gender, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is only possible to place citizens in such isolated places after the convicts have undergone appropriate medical examinations that prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib believes that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successful abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are held until the court decision) separate cells for transgender people are provided, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
It's the only way to deal with these criminals today.
They must be isolated because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in the normal cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the FSIN staff.
The lowering of trance by cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Hryb.
Depending on how big the city is, how many criminals with unknown sex, you have to figure out where to distribute them.
SIZO definitely doesn't need individuals - just cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
According to Grib, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, transsexual prisoners from any region will be able to serve their sentences there.
Citizens are held in detention centers at the crime scene, so it is unrealistic to see transvestites or transgender people from other subjects in the course of the investigation and trial, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, "says Grib.
On the eve of the incident, law enforcement officers could not decide which detention center - male or female - to identify 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis) who was arrested for drug possession, which is why the man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released on a non-displacement bond.
The news was widely discussed on social media and in the media, as there is no mechanism for keeping transgender people in detention centers and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that it is also possible to determine people in colonies abroad - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the sentence is correct.
Yes, it is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as does the issue of ensuring security for homosexuals in prisons", says Alexeev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prison than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to pass themselves off as transsexuals in order to get into a different colony than normal.
Of course, you can introduce medical screening before you put people in a transgender colony, but it's not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, but already in prison, she said she wanted to change her gender, "said Alexeev.
A person can feel like anything.
But until there are separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt that prison officials will seriously consider the safety of transgender people and delve into the nuances of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, international expert on reproductive health in the Russian Federation Boris Lordkykpanidze noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the beginning of punishment by convicts.
A commission is created, it's a sexology question, psychiatrists do long-term observations, it's not a single test to make a high-level conclusion.
The current state of psychiatry allows for this.
Therefore, before changing their sex, potential patients are always tested to see if sex reassignment surgery is necessary", says Lordkikanidze.
But I find it hard to imagine how this system could be applied to convicts, because it takes an average of a month to do a physical.
The doctor, although generally supportive of the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but if we consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, then we can say that transgender people are even less, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes, quite a small number, - said Lordkikanidze.
Now, if they apply to the prison administration, homosexuals and transgender people can still get separate conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won the world junior championship in chess.
The world championship in chess between juniors under 20 years of age has ended in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Kshistof Duda, who seemed to be confidently going for the title.
The girls' victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalya Buks.
The World Championship in Chess, which began in early September in Khanty-Mansiysk, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as the representative of Poland, Jan-Kshištof Duda, who won a series of four victories (the competition is held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Considering that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the gap seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the title fight.
Because Antipov needed to win in the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duda your party.
Plus, this necessity of winning, of course, could have affected the Russian chess player's game and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov was able to avoid them.
He was able to beat Francesco Rambaldi, but then had to wait for Duda, who had been dating Benjamin Bock, to finish his game.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
And that's why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District, whose governor Natalya Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have an intriguing ending.
The tournament leader - Natalia Bukse (Ukraine) - was successful in winning the title by not losing in the last round.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete was second, 0.5 points behind the champion.
The Wimpelem is changing the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As noted by the general director of Vimpelcom, Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being made to "remain a strong player in the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions".
In an interview with the TV channel "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce in Russia "tens of percent" of the staff.
Rospotrebnadzor has inspected 78 Burger King restaurants in Moscow and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the establishment on the Big Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after eliminating all violations.
Forty-three eateries violated the building code.
Among other violations, the sanitary-technical and sanitary-hygienic conditions of the premises, non-compliance with the requirements for ventilation, some establishments were found to have bacteria of the intestinal stick group.
The franchise for the Burger King brand belongs to the "Burger Rus" LLC of the owner of the "Chocolate Shop" chain Alexander Kolobov, there are 293 snack shops in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said the agency was against indexing 10% of freight rates and providing state subsidies as requested by the Russian Railways.
First they wanted a 17 percent indexation, now they want 10 percent, and also multi-billion dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say, this is wrong, this is too much, cut your spending, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS had its own, "much stricter" proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a $300 million put option, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal would have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the share price to Sumeru and the market price) which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or demand a surcharge.
Details of the negotiations at Polymetal are not being disclosed.
The option was made as part of Polymetal's purchase of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, director of the Housing Policy Department of the Ministry of Construction, said that the ministry is working with the Central Bank to develop a procedure for sanation of developers.
"We know that this is a real problem, so we are developing a mechanism", the official said.
The draft of the screenplay for Citizen Kane is up for auction.
Profiles in History auction house announced plans to auction off the black versions of the screenplay for Citizen Kane, considered one of the best works of director, screenwriter and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will begin in Calabasas on September 29th, and will feature three draft versions of the script, each with an estimated value of $20-30,000, reports AP.
The first draft, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest script in private collections and is titled "The American" - the working title of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade: Addressed food aid will not be the same as the cards in the USSR.
Russia's deputy minister of industry and trade Viktor Yevtukhov said the program of direct food aid would not be analogous to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
It is about modern, targeted food assistance to the population and supporting an efficient domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food stamp".
I would like to emphasize that the food cards should not be confused with the echoes of the past times of total shortages, with the card system of distribution, in which the quantity of food produced is regulated.
We have proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation", - quotes TASS the words of Mr. Yevtukhov.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that a program to introduce food stamps for the poor has been submitted to the government.
Read more about the initiative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade in the material "Igor Shuvalov instructed to prepare food cards".
The president of Rosgosstrakh wants a divorce from his wife.
A source familiar with the situation told RAPSI that the president of the insurance company "Rosgosstrakh" Daniil Khachaturov has filed a lawsuit in the Moscow court for divorce from designer Ulyana Sergienko.
The case will be heard by the 100th District Court on September 16.
Daniil Khachaturov asks to terminate his marriage and to divide the jointly acquired property.
The court confirmed the existence of a divorce claim in the proceedings, noting that the property division claim had not been filed and would be considered in the district court.
President of the Russian Railways Alexander Bobreshev is leaving his post.
The vice-president of corporate security of Russian Railways (RZD) Alexander Bobreshev is leaving the company, the Interfax news agency reported, citing a source.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Russian Railways Arkady Dvorkovich said that the issue of Alexander Bobreshov's departure from the Russian Railways was initiated by the new head of the company Oleg Belozerov.
According to the vice-premier, the personnel changes in the management of the Russian Railways are not related to the change of the head of the company.
Earlier, "Ъ" reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunin, the Russian Railways was headed by Oleg Beloserov, a Petersburg resident who was the first deputy transport minister and supervised the financial block.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: in a year and a half they will create a new system of cargo tariffs.
Read more about the changes in the company in the article "RZD will rewrite price lists".
This year, the survey of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of top-level Russian managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of last year's ranking winners.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year's ranking and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, who would be appropriate to add to the pool of candidates.
The following functional directors of the company may be nominated: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, personnel director, IT director, public relations and corporate relations director, public relations director, corporate management director.
Each manager proposed by the experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.

At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly according to the Internet rating and are closed information until the publication of the rating) or to make updated adjustments to them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The company names are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Ъ".
At the time of publication of the rating, there may be changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 and early 2015, lending to SMEs declined significantly.
The reason is obvious: the sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not profitable for anyone.
If in the past the bank could put all its possible problems in higher rates in the future, from delays to non-returns, now it is impossible to do so: rates are already sky high.
For businesses, the current rate of SME lending is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How do you estimate the demand for loans from entrepreneurs is being met?
After the Central Bank lowered the interest rate, the situation improved a little.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, our observations are that customers are now looking for loans much less often.
First of all, business does not understand its prospects for growth and future revenues.
Today, business has one option: to learn to work in the context of the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to be more careful about the current results, the flow of funds.
At the same time, if the financial resources are available, new technologies can be used to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make its products more competitive and keep the business going even in a volatile economic environment.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the Central Bank's policy, and now the regulator is showing consistency in lowering the key rate.
However, the price of loans to SMEs should not drop dramatically.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily inflation, which makes a higher interest rate necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the Central Bank lowers rates.
As regards the level of default, SMEs, which have traditionally been limited in their ability to replenish their funds and in their options for adjusting their economic behaviour, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the number of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is spelled in Japanese characters.
It's beautiful, concise, and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other model of the brand: without exuberance, attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
The Japanese, simply by virtue of their "Japanese" nature, are able to bring the love of the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of total delight.
You can make as many arguments for cars from other countries as you want, and you can even agree with them in principle, but the whole conversation falls apart with the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's no arguing about it.
Such people should probably love not only technology but also everything else Japanese.
To quote Basse, to spice up Wasabi, to collect katanas, and to dress your girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, but in the canon of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
I think the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls like to wear after school.
It has amazing qualities: sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change to the CX-5's appearance is a radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But the most striking change is the new design of the headlights and taillights, which make the car instantly recognizable in the traffic.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms sensual, but the appearance is also rigorous.
We won't have to call the police.
Driving a CX-5, one of the safest in the world, can only bring you stoic Japanese serenity.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
The fuel consumption of this engine is 175 hp. only 5.9 l. The power unit is equipped with automatic transmission and full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag. I was just...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has done everything possible to ensure that you do not end up in your own car accident while driving a CX-5.
To further increase comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension's front and rear shock absorbers were redesigned, and the shape of the front lower lever's inlets was optimized.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
Road and engine noise levels at high speeds are reduced by 13%.
A flower or striped swimsuit is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's another thing when a girl is flashing in a swimsuit with an original design.
For example, a computer game in the genre of action role-playing.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved design on both the front and rear seats, providing optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs - whoever has what.
Even the long-legged will appreciate that the supports at the front of the central tunnel are now soft and not hitting the ankles in the turns.
The widest range of active safety systems Mazda offers is on the CX-5.
To detect potential threats, radar, lasers and cameras are used.
There's adaptive lighting, lane departure warning, and dead zone monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
The rear seats fold in a 4:2:4 ratio - each section is equipped with a separate carrying lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 l.
The costume of the cartoon hero is called "kigurumi" in Japan.
It's a particularly fancy-looking pajama kiwurumi.
It's a place where you can do anything!
Of course I'm going to bed.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walk around like a beast on the street...
It's so great to have a choice of cool clothes, a cool attitude, a cool car.
Thank you for helping us prepare the material for Kawaicat.
Kiev has dismantled the nuclear union.
Kiev has officially announced that Ukraine has withdrawn from cooperation with Russia to complete construction of the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday voted to cancel the agreement with Moscow.
The agreements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project was never implemented.
On Wednesday, Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada adopted a law that cancels the agreement with Russia signed in 2010-2012 on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the government was only passed in the second round of voting, with 210 deputies supporting it for the first time, with a minimum of 226, but 234 members of parliament voted for the bill in the second round.
The Khmelnytsky AER, which was built under the USSR, was originally planned to have four 1 GW power units with VVER reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion of the building led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that the construction of the blocks would have to be on the loan of the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the 2014 coup in Kiev and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant and the project of building a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only sphere where relations have been preserved is the purchase of fuel from Russia for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (they provided about half of the electricity production in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NAPEC "Energoatom" has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
Plans to complete the construction of the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014, in Kiev, they announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary General is against the use of military force in the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference that Syria could not be resolved militarily.
"There is no military solution", he said in response to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I'll be meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria", he said.
Earlier today, the deputy chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air base in Syria in the future.
No plans to do that yet.
"But anything can happen", said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, "Ъ" reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military aid to official Damascus is necessary to fight the banned terrorist group "Islamic State".
Read more about the US's doubts about Russian aid to Syria in Kommersant's article "Russia's military presence in Syria worries Washington".
The OSCE PA is reporting a possible meeting of parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliamentarians to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations", Mr. Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "returning to normal life activities of our countries".
Asked whether he thinks it is possible to have a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the Normandy format or in the contact group format at the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was conducted, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, the politician said, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, Ukraine's representative at the talks, ex-president Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not changed their positions in principle yet at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given their mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the city Duma elections in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of violations during the elections were heard from representatives of the Communist Party of Russia, who accused the election in "covering up the fraud".
The opposition's remarks were not accepted.
At the same time, the election refused the party "Communists of Russia" to organize a referendum on the abolition of the fee for the overhaul of multi-apartment houses.
The city election commission officially presented the results of the elections to the Nizhny Novgorod city council by municipal electoral district.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued to the polling stations, and 268 thousand voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 seats were distributed among political parties based on their votes.
According to the lists of the United Russia, six deputies in the city council are Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Вячеслав Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was won by the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the KPRF are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and the State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates are awarded to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will run for city council: if they are not elected, the candidate goes to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the city election commission Alexander Makeyev informed the members of the commission that he was introducing a duty to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" to refuse mandates.
When approving the election results, the KPRF representatives said there were multiple violations.
The member of the municipal election commission with the right of consultative vote from the KPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormov district the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
For a long time, neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor observers could enter, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
All observers and members of the county commissions with advisory voting rights were able to attend the meetings.
The governor only stopped them when the voting was over and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to cast their ballots.
This was done to prevent provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and all the interested persons could attend", said the member of the city election committee Natalya Andryushina.
The Communists objected that the deputies of the regional assembly, Lyudmila Aristova, had been illegally detained in the blocked administration building for more than four hours, and a statement was sent to the Investigative Committee.
The opposition was also outraged that some polling stations began sealing the ballot boxes at 6-7 a.m. on election day, laying out early voting ballots.
The members of the advisory voting commission and the observers were not notified, so they came at 8 a.m.
The Communists believe that they could have thrown ballots uncontrollably into the polls in the morning before the polls opened.
However, the city election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeyev, found no violations with the throwing of unregistered ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova to come out with amendments to the regional legislation through the local election commission to clearly establish the time of opening the envelopes with early voting ballots, which then go to the ballot box.
"In the order of your own initiative, please contact the CEC", advised Alexander Makeyev.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman was attacked by a member of the Communist Party of Russia, Sergey Samochin, who shouted that the election commission ignored dozens of complaints and covered up fraud in the elections.
"You're not at a rally, be careful what you say!" the chairman of the election commission said.
The protocol was approved almost unanimously.
The election commission must approve the general election results by September 27, after which the first meeting of the sixth-convocation city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod will be held within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the election, the city election commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" to register an initiative group for the holding of a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party members were going to put two questions to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents: do they agree that the fees for the overhaul of multi-apartment houses should be "immediately canceled", and the tariffs for housing and communal services "freeze until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, down from 2016 projections.
FedEx reported disappointing quarterly results, and the delivery giant cut its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight and rising costs in its ground handling division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-trade trading 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts had been expecting $10.84 according to FactSet's review.
The decline is despite a 4.9 percent rate hike on average that will take effect on January 4 and a rise in land transportation fees for heavy or bulky cargoes that begins in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenue compared to last year due to cost cuts, increased gross revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "operated steadily in light of the weak, compared to forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday hiring plans were announced the day after competitor UPS announced that it planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as it hired last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the $2.44 per share average forecast by Zacks Investment Research's survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks had a forecast of $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the international express transportation sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express transportation division.
However, the boom in online shopping dramatically improved the FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, ground transportation revenue increased by 29%, but operating income remained broadly unchanged due to higher costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express division had higher revenues due to higher base rates, while the freight division had lower revenues due to higher labour costs.
In the preliminary trading, about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, down 11 percent year-over-year and 17 percent below their record high of June 11.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot redwood table deciding whether to raise key interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the two-story, ornate meeting room, a mural of the United States will hang over them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the country's economic interests above all others.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal Reserve have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in the almost predictable decision to be announced on Thursday as to whether the U.S. economy is ready to break free from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even as most data shows a confident economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may deter already cautious Federal Reserve leaders from adding volatility by raising the federal funds rate even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important consideration", said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait", she noted.
There's no consensus on what to do at the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes financial market volatility.
About half of the economists Bloomberg recently polled predicted interest rates would rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal Reserve to hold back, with the key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid recovery.
It could cause the stock market to crash if the Federal Reserve raises rates, unless decision makers soften the blow by promising that the next rate hike won't be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that the Federal Reserve's strategists would drop the stake this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal System raises rates at this point in time", he remarked.
If the Federal Reserve Board does this, "they will have to go a long way in asserting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic".
Other experts objected that a rate hike could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal Reserve seemed inclined to raise rates by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment dropped to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and near what the Federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of accelerating.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the Federal Reserve said the temporary effect of the plunge in oil prices was the key cause.
The economy "can and needs higher rates, given the shrinking labor market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% from a record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially recovered this month, and the Dow Jones is now about 10% below its May high.
For the Federal Reserve, the market upheaval further complicates the difficult calculations of the interest rate hike.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to spin the nuts at this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get more control over the fallout.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy could be, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China", Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a top concern of the Federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account in making these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve has become the world's financial powerhouse.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve might "mute" its monetary expansion caused a shock to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, one would expect the Federal Reserve to not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Carabell, CEO of Envestnet Inc., a company that specializes in global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve of overreaction to financial market movements that do not appear to be related to economic principles".
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on higher rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal Reserve to cut its base rate by 0.75% in three sessions, "despite limited identified effects on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Federal System reversed those cuts.
The Federal Reserve should only prioritize stability during major crises, such as the 2008 market crash", said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The last panic was nowhere near that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation where you're scared of rising rates because the markets are in turmoil", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get ahead of themselves.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thailand's Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tai Town.
The market/store is a store where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzying selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to buy some oil.
The store is huge, and it would take more than an hour to comb through all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen department of the store (good and cheap) is near the cash register and offers a variety of takeout options.
What do you suggest: Do you want anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold wholesale.
Fresh produce includes Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits, and more.
The meat counter is as varied as the fish counter - the staff at the counter will clean and cut the fish, and even fry it for you if you want.
The store's main area is an impressive freezer where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter gourd and galangal, whole duck, fish, beef blood and bile, pork carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-finished products, and more.
Who buys: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individual shoppers.
The wide passageway is used for store carts and forklifts.
Fresh durian montong near the exit.
Location: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, adjacent to the edge of Chinatown and the city's business center, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be crowded, parking is usually easy to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin believes the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East to allow waves of refugees to pour into Europe.
According to the Interfax, he made this statement to journalists in Ulan Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a fan of conspiracy theories, but the question is obvious: Is Europe not the ultimate goal of those who have so maniacal a persistence in destabilizing the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.
"Surely someone anticipated and knew that the flows of refugees, these unhappy and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, would rush to the prosperous EU countries", he added.
Naryshkin asked: "Have many European political leaders spoken out about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is literally flooding their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent", he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO tramples on many European values and international law norms.
"Europe has unfortunately long and impartially watched and continues to watch as the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are trampled under the military boot, sewn to NATO standards", the speaker stressed.
The government forces and loyal militias are opposed by rebels, mostly Islamists.
Later, the Syrian government's opponents were joined by the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia.
The U.S. is backing the rebels who are opposing both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels terrorists.
The Syrian president has named the reason for the hostility of the West to Russia.
The West's claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are actually that they are sovereign states.
This is what Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said in an interview with RT, the First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who will act in the interests of Western countries, not in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West".
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant Western claims that Assad himself must go, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, it is at the request of the people, not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately", he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about the military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, economy and military sphere.
He denied the claims that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been done", he explained.
As for the other countries, we are open to cooperating with any of them if they are serious about fighting terrorism.
"We don't see that with the so-called US-led anti-terrorist and anti-ISIL coalition", Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230,000, and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State", banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is launching airstrikes on ISIS positions.
In Utah, 12 people died in the flood.
At least 12 people have died in flooding in the U.S. state of Utah.
Another is still missing, Fox 13 Salt Lake City reports.
Water washed away several vehicles with people in them in the Washington area.
One of them, a van carrying the family, stopped in a dangerous area near the water and was suddenly caught by the current.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All of the dead were residents of the Colorado City and Hilldale areas hit by the storm.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
650 teams are involved in the search and rescue.

In the next game, which will be held on September 30, the armies will take the PSV on their field.
Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria
US Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
The topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
He said the United States had the tools to "further isolate Russia" if it supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reported.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov during the conversation with Kerry once again emphasized the need to create a united front to fight against terrorist groups operating in the territory of this country.
The sides also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were touched upon.
Earlier, US officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington has said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be further isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President Dmitry Peskov said the country would not be isolated internationally.
The rebels are calling for the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory has been taken over by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The international coalition led by the United States is attacking ISIS positions from the air.
Boroday called the information of the American newspaper a slander against Strelkov.
The former chairman of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He told this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lenta.ru".
The great thing about the Washington Post is that it's all screwed up.
The former DPR Defense Minister Igor Strelkov, of course, was not tied up and "went out" of the territory of the Donbass republics in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three vans of money, which are attributed to him by different characters", he noted.
According to Baroday, the conversation with a reporter of an American newspaper about Strelkov was really going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk people's republic", - said the former head of the government of the DPR.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to Russia "bound".
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is a surprisingly misunderstood word, because I emphasized that Strelkov left alone", Boroday noted.
"This is slander against me and Streskov", he concluded.
Earlier, The Washington Post published an article that quoted Baroday's words about his forced removal of Strelkov to Russia.
According to the newspaper, Boroday said he was forced to tie up his partner.
Polish authorities began searching for the Nazi gold train.
Polish loggers have begun cutting trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, the Third Reich's gold train is located.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to test the truthfulness of rumors of a treasure train.
There may be weapons and valuable minerals inside the train.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, authorities have decided to seal off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's deputy culture minister, Peter Zhukovsky, had said that local treasure hunters had a "99 percent chance" of finding the same train of the Third Reich gold that the legends tell of.
Zhukovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm reported to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzych that they had found a train in a walled tunnel 70 meters deep.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia's chief drug expert has proposed banning tobacco sales until the age of 21.
Before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is especially harmful", notes Eugene Brun.
He said this in a live broadcast of the radio station "Moscow Speaks", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
Man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, if you're physically ready.
He's mentally ready to live a full life in society at 21.
"It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is not fully mature until the age of 21", Brunn said.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Straight Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told "Izvestia" that Matviyenko supported the initiative to increase the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed to raise this issue again together with the Public Chamber on the floor of the upper house of parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop the bill under the leadership of Matviyenko.
The Bible was asked to be tested for compliance with the Children's Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk has asked the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development".
The author of the petition stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society from the "Read-Town" store on Red Avenue.
He found in the text of the book fragments that he believed violated the Federal Law "On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development".
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the Prosecutor's Office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the application of the residents of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
It's not about banning the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - the applicant commented to Sib.fm.
And it's a very serious problem that's going to affect society.
He will start reading the Bible again, something he has never done before.
Brazil's Rio Grande Union of Pediatricians promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a controversial method to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: a method that involves showing images of babies sucking on the breast, painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Because of the high energy requirements, pregnant and childbearing women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, recent research shows that just increasing calories is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects gene expression in infants and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets have been shown to have a negative effect on a child's immune system.
A train collided with a school bus near Hamburg.
A train collided with a school bus near Hamburg, which was stuck on a railroad track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move from the track, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision right in front of them.
He was videotaped by a student.
The emergency caused panic among the students.
Some children started crying and running along the sidewalk.
The route is still blocked.
According to police, no one was miraculously injured, except one passenger on the train who suffered minor injuries.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles in the International Boxing Federation (IBF) version in the 57,15 kg weight category, held on Friday, ended with a knockout victory for Magali in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was placed on life support.
In the professional ring, Brown has 22 wins, two losses and one draw.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second death of an Australian boxer in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends that the sport be banned altogether.
I realize this is unintentional", said Stephen Parnis, vice president of the organization.
But in the way boxing is now, there will always be situations where an athlete gets a hemorrhage or brain injury that leads to death or serious injury.
That's why the A.M.A. thinks we can't keep living with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body for practising doctors and medical students.
Sergey Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to cancel the sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergey Naryshkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said this while speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan Bator.
We view this as unacceptable, an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this must not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue", the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morality back into politics.
Let us put dialogue and justice back into the practice of international communication.
Let's bring humanistic ideals back to the democratic world order.
"The two-way has never ended well", he said.
Speaking from the Parliamentary Assembly's platform, the Russian State Duma speaker called on parliamentarians to convene an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge the members of the assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group", - said Naryshkin.
He also noted that the OSCE should be honoured.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine", the politician stressed.
The Parliamentary Assembly's autumn session opened on Tuesday, September 15 in Ulan Bator and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the win for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergei Shubenkov.
This season is a triumph for 24-year-old light athlete from Barnaul Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the 110-meter hurdles at the European team championship, set several records, and most importantly, became world champion, the first in the history of the national hurdles sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Diamond League", taking third place in the overall standings.
"New News" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the season.
Sergei, is the season over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to perform at the World Military Games in Korea in October, and then I'll think about rest.
I'm going to be home in Barnaul, but being home is a whole other state.
It's easier than just hanging around the world every week.
You once said that autumn was your favorite time of year.
Late August, early September is a wonderful time.
The passion has boiled over since the season opener, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete for pleasure, for relaxation.
Plus, you know, the vacation's coming up soon.
Are you tired?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions.
Fatigue always builds up at the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what I did more, whether I won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
The constant movement of people, the constant movement of people, all this is not without a trace.
You're tired physically and emotionally.
But I'm definitely feeling a little better right now.
I'm just happy!
By the time you finish the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists keep me in the dark about it.
But I think a bad athlete is someone who lives on past victories, who keeps running his successful runs over and over again.
I've been enjoying the win for a couple of days, and I need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say it was anything special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter racing season.
I trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the gym, then back at home.
It's the same as always.
But the coach and I set a challenge to try and get to a new level that I hadn't been to before.
They spent most of the winter laying the foundation.
We ran a lot of cross country, did some general fitness, which included pulling, squats, and back-pumping.
Then we started to train for the barrier, did a lot of technique.
You've been watching the competition?
I always try to do that, and in the age of the Internet, there's no problem with that.
I watched the European Winter Championships, and there in the hurdles sprint the French took the podium!
I thought we should do something to dilute this company.
With every start this season, you've been adding and adding to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had the same pattern for the last few seasons.
It's not like I'm running 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always unwrap my uniform gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was primarily aimed at this result.
But the paradox is that you kind of feel like you're ready for the big thing, and in a competition, you don't always get to show it.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I honestly tried to forget that semifinal race right away.
Got it really good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best result at that moment, he would have won the bronze medal.
But I was unlucky.
Remember your first World Cup?
What's the point?
It was in the tag.
I really wanted to get to the finals, there was such a program-maximum.
And he fell right off the rails in the prelims.
That's when I realized that to tear and to walk with your head broken is to run nowhere.
Two years later, at the world championships in Moscow, he reached the final with the best time.
I remember feeling so strongly about winning the gold medal.
How do you develop a decent speed without losing your head, without losing your mind?
And that's the hard part.
You have to be very careful, focused on the technique, not to break down barriers.
I've noticed that when you're focused on the process, not the outcome, it's a lot easier.
The best part is when you feel like you're running and it's like it's happening all by itself!
I promise you, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the countryside after the first serious successes are looking to move closer to the capital.
You never thought of that?
It's better at home.
I don't know where I'd be without my coach. Who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.
How long have you and Klevtsov been together?
Since I was 12, since I started running.
Actually, I was first trained by his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she transferred me.
I started with the sprint, then the long jump, the triple jump.
Kids' wrestling was, like, throwing a ball, jumping in the air...
I tried obstacle running at 14, and I loved it.
From the first run, I managed to meet the second adult standard.
It's still there.
You never had a fear of barriers?
I managed to get a deal right away.
But the technology has always been a lot of work.
I've been through a lot over the last few days.
But you can't get away from this routine.
I had to work on the technique all the time so that I could be woken up at night and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your run in Beijing says it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you. - Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my runs, but I couldn't help myself.
But efficiency is something that needs to be worked on, and there's no limit to perfection.
Aren't you worried that winning the Olympics a year before will be a heavy burden?
As they say in these cases, I'll try to live up to expectations.
If I choose this path, I must go all the way.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra burden.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Oh , my God .
Well, I'm not so naive as to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them bread - give, throw the enemy.
And even though I didn't wave the flag, and I've said the same thing, exactly the same thing, a million times here, and I didn't call anyone a bastard directly, something else hit me.
All my fake friends just vanished in a flash.
The pressure I'm under is so intense that even I, who've seen the faces of boys, think white people are being taken advantage of.
It's like walking, walking, and then being attacked by a mob and then being mutilated with sticks.
But you know me, I'm not a house-eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, you guys, to be scared.
It's another thing to have no support.
I didn't have any illusions before, but now...
The best part about me has always been self-sufficiency, so take a bite.
And passports for freaks like Fred Durst or Monson are for assholes.
I'd rather be a good reporter with a job that's not embarrassing.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the events in Crimea in a sharp way:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I'm assuming that the reference to a drunk Khrushchev trying to sign something doesn't fit the general picture of a human dormitory at all.
It's like coming to your neighbor's house and taking his space...
The war started from the Kremlin, and it will end only there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some bastard in the Kremlin.
I have a hunch who it could have been...
Kobzon doesn't have much time left.
I don't understand, he's the greatest entertainer, why he has to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they tore down his statue.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their little country.
And the reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise 7th leads the ratings despite attempts by 9th to cover the loss of the lead on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's trip to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party's announcement that the leader's seat was vacated failed to raise the Today rating much.
The Ninth's morning show was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull defeated Tony Abbott.
Sunrise, with David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a weekly international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture at a distance seemed to have little effect on Australian television viewers, with Sunrise's audience at 397,000 in the five largest cities compared to Today's audience at 339,000.
Today gained a little more than its rating on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been closing the gap with Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers compared to 314,000 for Today.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are blowing more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification.

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children has drawn an impressive audience of 1.219 million.
Critics debated whether Thomson could handle the popular show on her own, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a resounding "yes".
The X Factor VII remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million, easily overtaking The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, it was a mixed blessing and a curse on the second night of the Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new television show, which was hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, drew 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (from 5:30 to 6:00), the number jumped to 623,000 - enough to win a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers, and the second half hour drew a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat has raised $620,000.
Chase Australia's second-night ratings plunge will force Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat the McGuire show.

The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he pick?
The secret is out?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snejana Markoski may have accidentally given away who will win The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood will eventually be left with in The Bachelor is shrouded in mystery.
And the three finalists, of course, are silent about who exactly got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snow Markoski and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two out of three girls should be left, they may have inadvertently given us a clue as to the winner.
Sam Wood is steadfastly keeping quiet until the final on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, determination, family values, and cheerfulness as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?" could have been a subconscious hint as to who really won the heart of The Bachelor.
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski were unquestioning in calling Mackay the perfect match for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have been on good terms since day one.
"From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy of [Sara] and the energy of Sam and I knew they were perfect for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about that", Jevons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun to be with", added Marcoski.
I saw them together, they really do have an attraction.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a great couple.
McKay herself said that her house dates last week made her realize that Wood might be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a game - I believed him with all my heart", she says.
When asked who else to choose, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it", she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow White and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 pm on Channel Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have been keen on him since his move to the US - as have many other clubs who sent in requests after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsull, and it seemed like the wise thing to do.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for losing a ball that the former Australian rugby league player allowed on his first punt return in the 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another shot to get his punt back, and also brought him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed his good side after the game in the locker room.
Instead of throwing a tantrum at the newcomers in front of the team, he cheered them on.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special teams reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne lost a punt return to the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter.
This was clearly not the start of his NHL debut for Hayne and his many Australian fans.
He was seen cursing as he left the field after losing a ball, and later told the hosts of the "Hamish and Andy" show on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unfortunate start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and that's it", said Hayne.
Hayne compared his miss to his debut in the 2007 Origin series, when a shot in his own goal area gave Queensland a try.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Heine took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at a Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company was seized, and his attempts to advance democracy were thwarted.
There have been clashes between migrants and police at the Hungarian border.
The refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants throw stones at police and try to tear down the border fence.
The police are responding to the migrants' aggressive actions and attempts to cross the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading to Belgrade and the Croatian border, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country have allowed the migrants to arrive on Croatian territory and have ensured their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the involvement of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and an accelerated procedure for processing asylum applications.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he will be deported and unable to return to Hungary for a year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends to consider the transfer of the functions of the country's parliamentary border guarding to the Hungarian armed forces in the near future.
In late June, Hungarian authorities began building a 175-kilometer-long barbed-wire fence along the border with Serbia to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
A Russian man has confessed to the largest cyber attack in U.S. history.
Russian Vladimir Drinkman, accused of the largest cyberattack in U.S. history, has admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During his trial in federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian told about the collusion with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the defendants was estimated at $300 million.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security", U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said.
Drinkman faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When the court pronounces sentence, it will take into account the Russian's confession and possibly reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentencing is set for January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was arrested.
The latter denies any wrongdoing.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risks of Russia supporting the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
During a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition", the State Department said in a statement posted on its website.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to combating the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
According to the secretary of state, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed that the Syrian conflict can only be resolved through a political transition away from Assad.
The White House has threatened to isolate Russia for supporting the Assad regime.
The day before, White House press secretary Joshua Earnest threatened to isolate Russia if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed joining an international coalition that was conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russian soldiers have been in Syria for years, helping Syrians to develop equipment to use against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police opened fire with rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred late Tuesday in Rupandey district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakar reported that the officers used tear gas, then fired in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where the Madezi people say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among Taro citizens who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes starting on 10
The country's first constitution was adopted on August 8, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a crucial step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a 900-employee facility.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires systematic support.
A year ago, the new mayor of Sayansk, Oleg Borovsky, took over.
He told the correspondent of "Obsłaszna" about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valeryovich, how did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I have been acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, I have initiated an independent audit of the spending of local budget funds.
Then the municipal property was audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the documentation cycle to five days.
Previously, the paperwork could go months.
Measures were developed to increase the income base and optimize expenditures.
In November last year, a government meeting was held in Sayansk, where issues of social and economic development of the territory were considered.
The city did not have a single project-smetic documentation (PSD).
Without it, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the road, kindergarten, northern sewer and water pipes.
Roadworks are already underway at two sites.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demographic in the city has not been seen in 27 years.
So the issue of ensuring places in kindergartens is one of the most pressing today.
Since September 1, the No. 10 kindergarten, designed for 320 children, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of the repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received this kind of money before.
Last year, after renovation, the 23rd kindergarten was opened, which now attends 200 children.
The repair was done on the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the help of the regional government, funds were found to purchase furniture and equipment, and the "People's Initiatives" program helped.
Plans are underway to build a new kindergarten in 2016.
With this, we plan to eliminate the queue for children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have lines for three to seven-year-olds.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be done primarily by the Sayan enterprises, they need to be provided with work.
In October, a 60-apartment orphanage in the Leningradsky neighborhood was put into operation.
As for construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of four cities in the Angara region that have been included in the programme for building economy class housing.
All the necessary paperwork is ready.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
We've announced a total of 10,000 square meters of housing.
One of the conditions is that the cost of the housing should not exceed 30 thousand rubles per square meter, and this includes the finishing "under key".
If we can meet the volume requirements, we'll continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the area was home to the Sayans Pig Complex, which was sold for a pittance in 2004.
We're working with the D.A.'s office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the facility is federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to the regional ownership, with subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the pig farm, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a big boost to the city.
Is there a social partnership institute in Sayansk?
We have about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
The company is supported by enterprises such as the East Center, the Novo-Zima TEC, the Sayan Broiler, the PK MDF, and the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the city, the company "Sayan broiler" gave the city a children's town, the firm "Vostok-Center" repaired the horse yard, where specialists are engaged in children's therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, the territory of the city ZAGS was able to be improved.
Sponsors helped us to celebrate the City Day in a colorful way.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city groups and organizations.
The city chronicle, the book of the sayans poets was published.
The first builders and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded with jubilee medals.
The city's charity fund also includes the city's own donors.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
Over the past nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles have been allocated to support talented children, help children who need expensive treatment, support children from low-income families.
How are social personnel problems solved in Sayansk?
There's a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
Housing is a key factor in the solution of the personnel problem.
Last year, we allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received official housing.
We have a housing program that can be privatized in five years.
Plans call for a redesign of the building, which will house eight more teachers' apartments.
Teachers and doctors are also participating in the "Dwelling for Russian families" program.
In the future, we'll build a house for the budget workers.
The important thing is that the city has a working team that I can work with to solve the most difficult problems.
It's important to make the right choices in all crises, and life doesn't stop.
Sayansk and our region have great potential.
The Duma has introduced a bill to index social pensions in light of rising prices.
The State Duma has introduced a bill that provides for the indexation of social pensions every year from February 1 taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document - a deputy from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
According to current legislation, indexation of social pensions is carried out annually from April 1 taking into account the growth rate of the pensioner's subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The bill, which was introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth of consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February, and the second indexation is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini that sanctions against parliamentarians were unacceptable.
In an official letter to the EU's top foreign affairs official Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA speaker Ilkka Kanerva said sanctions against lawmakers participating in the assembly's activities were unacceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the OSCE PA autumn session in Ulan-Bator, Nikolai Kovalev.
As TASS reports, European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have collected signatures in support of Canerva's position.
"A strong enough support has already formed", said Kovalev.
Earlier, he had said that the head of the OSCE PA was speaking with the intention of collecting signatures of deputies who pointed out the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise the issue to the level of the EU's governing structures and "send a relevant petition".
NHC reports a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of Cape Green.
A broad low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, according to Miami weather forecasters.
Google launches a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a double-duplication campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach when announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We traveled by dubious trains and buses, enduring hunger, thirst, cold and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be given to four nonprofit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the initial $5.5 million donation until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely triggered by Syria's four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For diabetics with moderate obesity , obesity surgery may help .
The beneficial effects of obesity surgery in people with mild obesity and type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that people with low-grade diabetes live longer after surgery for obesity than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The death rate is not coming out right away", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Bariatric surgery has been proven effective for treating type 2 diabetes for several years, but the main studies have been conducted in morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher means you're overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and arm gastrectomy - with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The average BMI of those who had surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatment remained at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36 percent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 percent were partially cured.
In contrast, only 1 percent of the drug-treated group had a complete cure and only about 2 percent had a partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group", the authors say.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which mirrors blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But better glycemic control, reflected in good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, according to study leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes of the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, the shunt group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg) than the sleeve gastrectomy group, had a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show any benefit from surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery does lead to longer life expectancy, reports Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix.
A Swedish study found that obese people who chose bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years than those who used more traditional treatments.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encourages people with a BMI below 35 to be interested in the procedure.
"The report is very important here because it states that this surgery is safe in the low BMI group, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease", she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to get people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse.
In the town of Mytiches, robbers took out fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In the Washing Machine, robbers attacked a Moscow-area house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's furs.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered the house on Gorky Street through an open front door, tied up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with knives, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was opened under the article "Razboy".
Fans from Europe are at risk of homelessness.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to watch the 2018 World Cup.
The other hotels are still waiting to get the permits.
Experts say it's a very alarming sign.
In the run-up to the World Cup, the authorities must urgently find a way to relocate all the city's guests.
Rosbalta's interlocutors believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship, you will have to pay more for rental housing.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law written specifically for the first place, every hotel in St. Petersburg must go through a classification procedure and prove that it meets the stated number of stars and the level of service.
It is clear that not everyone can do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
As UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov said, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the antitrust authorities.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is, we're literally on every number right now, and we can't afford to lose any before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all of St. Petersburg's hotels.
Now the city has 30,500 rooms for tourists.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to Nana Gvichiia, first deputy of the Committee for Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have been classified so far - the same number of inspections carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny surprisingly does not know.
So there could be more, but no one knows.
"The last six months, hotels have not been very eager to qualify", said Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the Northwest Branch of the Russian Union of Tourist Industry.
This is because it's the high season, when hoteliers make the most money and don't want to do other things.
Another reason is the budget, which has not been set for the costs of inspections, while the procedure can cost the hotel from 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more depending on the status.
But recently, hotel managers have been more active and have begun to apply for classification, Shadskaya said.
Hotels have to be done by July 1, 2016, or they'll not only pay the fine, but they won't even get to work at the World Cup.
It's already known that depending on the star rating, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formula for calculating the cost will be published next year.
This is done to prevent prices from soaring by 200-300%, as is the case, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to be very conscientious about not getting two or three pay raises, but you have to let the hotels make money.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%", explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixing is in line with the understanding of market economy.
I don't know how much of this fits into economic theory, but I hope it's a good measure.
"It's better than uncontrolled price increases", he said.
It's unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
The state Duma has introduced a bill that would prohibit hostels in residential buildings.
We hope very much that this law will not be passed or affect St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved", says Nana Gvachia.
However, she said, the owners of mini-hotels should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code in any case.
If the State Duma approves the bill, about 80% of the hostels in St. Petersburg will be closed, and there are currently about 1,500 rooms.
According to Leonid Garbar, president of the Northwest Restaurant and Hotel Federation, there is a lack of two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are in demand among football fans, but there is a shift towards four- and five-star hotels.
This is similar to the situation when "75 thousand whistles are sitting in an 80,000-seat stadium".
And that's exactly what the mini-hotels can fix.
The expert calls the possible ban "idiotism": "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason the visitors can't".
If the hostel is being used as a dorm, then I agree that's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests come for a short stay, why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the World Cup because of their slowness.
Hundreds of small hotels simply don't get classified, and they dig their own hole.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordering work.
"There are not many companies that can do this, so they will refuse less expensive mini-hotels and choose the more expensive ones", said Lamshin, adding that in some cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the number of checks is much higher than in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is the constant changes in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to a smooth work.
According to experts, if there are not enough hotels in St. Petersburg, then it is likely that we will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg may mobilize a river fleet to the city, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
And many fans will be coming in vans that will be ready for the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will later empty", - assures Gennady Lamshin.
Also popular during the football championship will be rental housing.
They're probably gonna set up a rental reserve in town.
Rents will go up 10 to 30 percent.
"The first to leave will be the homes near the stadium", said Larisa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate.
And the rent may not be back to the way it was after the championship, especially in the sleeping quarters.
The construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city will also help, she stressed.
We must not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar believes that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only show the way, but can also take a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
My dad met a family from Murmansk in the yard in 1970 - a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to stay, and hotels were hard to find, and it was hard to sleep at the train station.
"And Dad took them to our communal apartment to sleep", recalled the interviewee.
However, he added that now the city's residents have no such trait left - calling home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, mistakes of hoteliers and governments, we will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "spoiled" the Amur region.
I was watching the clown Zhirinovsky in the State Duma with admiration.
He did this stuff when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is "LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region".
The LDPR does not shake its hands about the protocols, because it has nothing; other protocols, except those signed by the election commissions, the LDPR apparently does not have.
He picks up the runner-up, Ivan Abramov, and shouts something like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then he throws himself at Rodnina, and then, after a fight with the chairman, he takes the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You are all crooks and thieves with your fronts".
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and the faction's demarche as a result of that scandal and insult.
Wolfowicz really did a beautiful and elegant fusion of the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Zhirinovsky "Podoneski!" joke, and not a protest by a political party against the results of a particular election.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the election, if you believe the party website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the topic.
He allows the dead on Amur to bury their dead themselves, and he himself is against "United Russia" in general and the innocent Rodnina.
A fine decision to keep your face and not get into a real, not a show scandal.
The other thing is, Abramov is in a weird position now.
He's been waiting for nothing but the screams of his superiors, no protocols of alternatives on hand.
He's not in the public eye, on the one hand, but on the other hand, for a small circle, he's the formal reason for insulting a respected champion, and, even more cool, the brutal attacks on the European Parliament and the UNF.
And then he's got to really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the number two politician in the region and the number one candidate for the only regional single-member district, he can become a pariah, successfully used by his own party leadership and a super-irritant for the same ONF and the party leadership of someone else.
If there were no Zhirinovsky, he would have to be invented and respected.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There's a rumor that the LDPR will be back in the room during the next plenary.
So the bathtub fell out of nowhere.
The only thing that's buried underneath is Abramov.
It's really beautiful.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader calls for an end to violence in refugee homelands
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre for Ethics Research in Oxford at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the actions being taken by Germany and Austria in the wake of the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It's great to care for thousands of refugees, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries", he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying the US's harsh response had set off a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I wrote my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force and it had unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Four times the number of children who swallowed hand sanitizer in the last four years.
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who have swallowed high-alcohol hand sanitizer, reports the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, reported hand sanitizer ingestion by children under 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are exposed to these substances more often, and unfortunately, some of them end up in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends or to stir up a social media controversy.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
The teens reportedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smell of the disinfectant.
"The child doesn't think it's going to hurt him", Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizer) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers that smell like strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just leave a shot of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get their hands on them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested about four sprays of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, more than twice that of an adult who is legally considered intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her all night in a separate children's clinic to make sure no signs of brain injury were missing, as the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary", Naija's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic substances or disinfecting wipes, and to keep hand sanitizer out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a disinfectant containing a toxic unreported ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than the ethyl alcohol that was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their "opposite" teacher by "spreading antibacterial agents in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizers, and she forbade them from being in her classroom.
Police say the failed plan was "talking nonsense" and are asking the school district for discipline.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
On the back of a bench at the entrance to the N.K. Krupskaya Children's Library, a piggy-owl is sad.
The kids who come for the books try to feed her candy.
Several generations have been coming to this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twentieth century arranged loud readings, staged performances on Mayakovsky's poems, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin" wrote in 1939, with each day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent a childhood photo to some distant friends in Barnaul.
And when the Barnaul people asked if she was against the library being named after her, she said no, she was not.
The letters have long been dusty in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose stern profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
During the reconstruction, people often called and said: "Why is the children's library not renamed?"
Let's have a library named after a good children's writer, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought about it, and decided to leave everything as it was.
The Krupskaya is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as is the Lenin Library in Moscow.
On the floor in the lobby of the library is a yellow brick path.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite subject of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Before, Olga was a manager at a law firm, she came to work at eight, left at five, and the only thing that made her different from all the other managers was her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad online that said, "I need an illustrator for a book".
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy".
Ola was doing illustrations, and she thought, "Life can end at any moment, and there's no miracle in it unless you create it yourself".
Now she works in a library, illustrates children's books by writers from around the world and writes fairy tales herself.
It's traditionally believed that children lose interest in books, that they live more and more in some virtual space...
But we have children who read, and their parents understand the importance of reading", says Tatyana Kushvid, director of the library.
In recent years, we have even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed and will live - children come here!
I think my interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library there is a large exhibition stained glass window with a renewable photo exhibition.
Every quarter, new photographs of readers are posted, who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and kids.
The library is happy that dads are coming more often with their children.
If a child is given all of Chukovsky at two years of age, he needs more difficult books at an older age.
But now there's a law that says an eight-year-old wonder kid can't give out grade 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a child must bring his parents with him - they come, then they come back again, and gradually Krupskaya becomes for them something like a family club.
The library has treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of old books with yats and yards, Korolenko's novels in the appendix to the journal "Niva", the cover of "Murzilka" for 1936.
We are not just a conceptual space of the "temple of books", we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a workplace, not a school", explains Tatyana Kushvid.
You can come to our place and read, play, paint.
We made a playground for the little ones. The kid comes in just to play, and his hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, and they hold their legs, they don't want to leave.
And there are a lot of wheelchair moms, and we're glad that they put the library first among all the other places to go with their babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says that today's children love classic children's literature as much as we did:
"The publishing business is now developing, and much attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations".
And when it comes to little kids, they need a hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to leave their heroes.
The library regularly publishes booklets for parents that tell them what is happening in modern children's literature, which books to look for and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
It's a magical privilege only children have.
...In the far room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the bookcase.
The steps will squeak under your feet. It's a very old time machine.
You meet your childhood book like an old friend: hello, it's good that we're the same.
Ellie is still walking happily on a yellow brick road, Tolya Ryzhikov is a lazy man stealing magic matches, and Little Chick-Kibalchich never told the damn bourgeois the Military Secret, that's his word.
Books are like passwords, you can tell your own anywhere.
There are also rare books in the vault - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of old books with yats and yards.
Or you can get Korolenko on the famous Niva magazine app.
Or a 1936 Murzilla stitch.
Time has aged the pages, turned them to tea.
These publications are no longer being distributed.
These are pieces of our future collection, and I dream of retiring and becoming a rare children's book author.
But children can't do that anymore, so to speak: the colors in old books are not very bright, and the topics... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now I wonder why we all wrote this "Pioneer Truth" out.
But it was still interesting, says Galina Ilyasova, the bookstore manager.
The pages of "The Mouse" have darkened with time.
Galina Vasilievna has been a bookkeeper all her life.
She knows what color Buratino's caps are, what school year Harry Potter captained Gryffindor's Quidditch team, what situations Carlson uses a muffler for on-board, and who Alice Selesneva's father works for.
The job of librarian is low-paying, and those who can live without these book series quickly find other careers.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult of books.
They are also recognizable by their smile, which is considered a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiles at you the first minute you talk to him, he's a pro.
I love children's books: as a librarian, I like them to be neat and beautiful on the shelves, and I also love to read them, says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: war, historical novels, fairy tales, and fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, recent translations...
Of course, I think my childhood was different.
Books were the most interesting and exciting thing that had ever happened to me.
And because I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sat and read.
I hope there will always be books, despite the readers.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring their children and even their grandchildren...
There are no differences at Celtic.
Griffiths denied the Celtics' disagreement after Dale admitted that the Hoops were in a bad spot, but he would fix it.
Hearts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim on Neilson, and Warburton is worried about signing contracts in January that could undermine the team's unity.
The Dons have increased their lead over Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight advantage over Hamilton at Pitodrie, allowing the Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denied the rumors of a disagreement.
This sparked rumors of disagreements within Celtic, which were put to rest by Griffiths, who stated that he and his teammates were not suffering from any heightened criticism as they prepared to meet the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the players are reaching for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in contention for the title.
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic as they were not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now a spokesman for Ajax, said: "The most exciting moments of Celtic games are no longer shown in Holland, and why?"
That's because there are no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the Old Firm Games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm going to change everything", Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was having a tough time, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat to Malmö and the resulting exit from the Champions League was followed by a loss to Aberdeen's 10 players, who now lead the table with five points.
However, Dale stated, "The Celtics have had bad periods before, and we're going to come out again".
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I know it's very upsetting, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the Celtics' support, because that's what makes the players so much better.
It's so important to stay together right now.
Warburton is looking forward to January transfers .
Despite speculation emerging just a couple of weeks ago suggesting he has set some of the goals for the January transfer window, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of the January campaign, claiming he doesn't want to disrupt the team's unity.
The former Brentford forward stated: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season starts to adapt them, which you've seen in our own squad this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Celtic, has hinted at a career ending
Swansea striker Mitch, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may leave football once his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years, and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts are going to challenge SFA over Nelson's claims.
Hart led 2:1 when Patterson was removed, and started to lose 3:2, but the defender's red card was later canceled; this was Colum's third red card to be canceled in eight months.
Nelson did not back down, stating, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game".
Griffiths has vowed to avoid Tynecastle.
A headstrong Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive words about former Hartz player Rudy Scatella.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was hot", the striker said, adding: "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to come back to Tynecastle if he wasn't playing for Celtic.
The Tanadis board is confident in the Dundee United management.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board is still confident that the management team will change things for the better, but agrees that the deterioration on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're going to get the guys ready to go out again", Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to have won the Hamilton ugly.
Derek Mackinness admitted that his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assists to win their seventh successive league title, putting them five points above Celtic, at the top of the table, thanks to a penalty from Adam Rooney in the first half.
McInnes said, "There's not a team that's won anything, cups or league championships, that hasn't won games like this".
Unemployment rates among Scots remain stable, while in the UK as a whole they are rising.
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, at 5.9%, was higher than the UK's 5.5%, as shown by figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, to 2,612,000 today.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% for the quarter - higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scotland's minister for affairs David Mandell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the last 12 months, we have seen further improvement in the Scottish labour market, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I 'm a witness to the Oklahoma State execution
Today, avoiding legal intervention late in the day, I'm going to watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the observation gallery of the death chamber at Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first time he asked me to do it was in January, through a close friend, and I was shocked, but I agreed.
As that day approached, I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of a grim lottery determine who is chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press offices has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever gets elected will watch this without emotion.
I can't do this. I can't do this.
I'm gonna be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've developed our own relationship after months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better", but she still felt that I was wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to cover it.
If he dies, he thinks publicity will help the abolitionist movement.
Kim Bellver, reporter from the Huffington Post, will be joining me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry van Treese's murder make him guilty of aiding and abetting.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm pretty sure the evidence for the death penalty wasn't enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't claim to be entirely objective.
There'll be other reporters you can reach out to.
I'll show you what it's like to watch someone I like die unnecessarily.
A man being chased by police was talked out of the Canning River .
A constable from Canning Vale managed to get a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
The Perth resident tried to escape the police but was unable to do so, being trapped in dirty water on a shallow water course a few metres from a police officer who was trying to "gently persuade him to come ashore".
Canning Vale Police were called on Tuesday for trespassing in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to run away from them by jumping into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not coming out, come on, catch me,'" said Staff Sergeant Shandell Casaldine.
Constable Lachlan Perchavez didn't really want to wet the uniform, so he used a safer technique: "talk to a good cop".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape", says Staff Sergeant Casaldine.
That's what champion football player Ben Cousins is remembered for.
In 2006, Cousins moved into a ditch to avoid meeting a police patrol for a blood alcohol test, and tried to swim across the Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but they prompted the local inhabitants to invent a humorous "Ben Kazins biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to retire from horse racing .
Peter Moody has accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to plant a spy in his stable last year and threatened to quit the sport immediately.
He targeted the stewards and staff of Racing Victoria's ethics department, whom he accused of organising a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatay from the race for violating the rules on the use of drugs on race day, Wednesday, was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always goes out of his way to compete, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to a positive Lidari test for cobalt, which he could not explain.
He kept his mouth shut about the espionage allegations for a year and a half and didn't want it to "look like a green grape".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I put up with it for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of control that you can't hold back", Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop coaching.
Then I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Moody had previously made a sensational claim during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'll name if asked and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I do in my stable", Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all definitely report back, since they failed to catch me.
Robert Rolston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, current RVL CEO, knew this all along and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold people accountable for what's happening in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad for this job?
Am I so bad for this job?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm about to say might make them think about it.
But I'm at a point now where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about this.
I'm going to put pressure on them and make them responsible for their decisions.
I have the support of my family, and I can leave.
The coach's annoyance only grew as the long investigation into the Cobalt and Lidari incident continued, and the horse's recent withdrawal from the race prompted him to declare that he might "throw his license on the table".
Moody, best known for training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the requirement for medication on race day "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, a violation of the rules.
It's a race against the rules.
"I must take full responsibility for this", he declared.
One of my employees accidentally gave her a leg compress.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, which she did.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the competition day medication rules for using a compress, which the stewards have opened an investigation into.
This is a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
Driver who hit and fled the scene in Cobram, arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
A motorcyclist was flown by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway early Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia turned himself in to Shepparton police.
He's expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has defended his opponents' accusations of using harsh force.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called his team's criticism of the interception "an imposition of the agenda" by the two NRL championship favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "fight" his team during the Storm's surprise win in the final of the Sydney qualifier on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear reference to the Storm after his side won the Northern Queensland Cowboys' final of the qualifying tournament on Saturday evening, when he called the game "typical" for rugby league and stated that two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team's interception and stated that they were simply focused on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the criticism of his team by two top coaches, as it meant they were worried about a possible loss to the Storm.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about tough receiving when they beat us 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee you we haven't changed anything in a year in our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that over the last six weeks we've focused on interception contacts, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it was kind of a shock to him.
Funny how it always shows up this time of year.
Bellamy disputed Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by showing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was", remarked Bellamy.
I remember in 2010, St. George was getting a lot of criticism for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're a little bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm-Rusters game was a higher-scoring contest than the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos probably had a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries - and what, this is impressive football?
Or should we consider breaks and failures impressive?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means we might meet them there at some point.
The Storm are off the weekend, as they have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final at AAMI Park next Saturday night, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serbian drug-possessed man released on $ 200,000 bail
A man facing life in prison for attempting to smuggle 40kg of cocaine into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bond.
Marco Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay, a yacht that was sailing from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
During the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the dock, and later he met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovich faces life in prison for attempting to possess a quantity of drugs sufficient to sell, Maximovich's lawyer claims there is no evidence that Maximovich tried to obtain the entire batch and that the man may have been in the cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was skeptical that Maximovich should be released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he told the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich's mother and stepfather were offered a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the $200,000 bail amount is too much of a financial burden for them", Judge Flanagan observed.
But that alone is not enough to guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, be marked by the police daily and observe the curfew from 6pm to 6am.
Fotis Katzikaris: "Proud of the Greek team, who fought until the last second".
Greece's head coach Fotis Kacicaris paid tribute to his team after the quarterfinal match of EuroBasket 2015 against Spain (71:73).
He said the game was decided by a few mistakes.
It was a big game, quotes AFP quoting Katsikaris.
We were preparing for a great play by the Spaniards.
We tried to work on defense, but mistakes in defense determined the outcome.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought to the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be assigned the functions of Kaun at CSKA".
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland has said he doesn't believe in the army curse.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who has left the team, both in the defensive structures and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to rebuild to center, but I was more of a power forward in the NBA.
Now I'm gonna have to go up against a bigger center opponent, but I've done that before, so I think I can handle it now.
The Army won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they've made it to the Final Four six times, but they've failed to show their best basketball each time.
There's a feeling the team was compromised.
That's the whole point of the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best of what we can do, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eye, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, and if you put those two things together, anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "The match against Roma will be special for me".
The head coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with "Roma" with special feelings.
According to the coach, a face-to-face match between his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached the Wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show his best side in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome after several years of experience. - Luis Enrique, UEFA official website
I have very fond memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the Champions League with a win.
August's meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the teams' performance in the next match.
I expect Roma to play the way they did in Serie A against Juventus.
They're a strong team, they can press and they know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar" has various options for attacking".
Acting head coach of the Ural Vadim Skripchenko noted the diversity of the team's offensive schemes ahead of the 9th round of the Premier League match against Krasnodar.
According to the coach, the Bulls have several offensive game models in their arsenal.
The match will take place on September 21 and will start at 16.30 Moscow time.
We'll see how we play with Krasnodar, - says the official website of the Ural, Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has a variety of offensive options, a variety of attacks, but we're not a slow team, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is playing a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Rocher Canyas: "Astana can take away points from anyone".
"Astana" midfielder Rocher Kanyas after the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament with "Benfica" (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to the quarterback, on their field, the A's can take away points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - the official website of UEFA quotes Kanyas. - We lacked a little courage in the attack.
Benfica are up there, but in their home game, I think we can count on taking away their points.
It's very real.
But first we have to think about Galatasaray, then about Atletico.
In home games, we can take away points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll say it again: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
The head coach of Real Madrid, Rafael Bennis, expressed his satisfaction with the big win in the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group tournament against Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored three goals.
The match was not easy because Shakhtar can hold the ball, - quotes the official website of UEFA words of Benitez.
The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks always hide danger.
I won't say that Real played perfectly, but we had plenty of chances to score.
I'm glad we didn't miss and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say that as many times as I want.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo is not like Messi".
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one can compare to his teammate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, the Real forward Cristiano Ronaldo can't do it either.
Messi is five goals above the rest, - quotes Le Figaro Alba. - What Leo is capable of doing, no one can.
Not even to Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also a vivid personality.
"Roma" midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group stage match against Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and understatement in a game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let's just say that the SEC is going to be doing a text feed.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players, - quotes the official website of UEFA De Rossi. -
The blue-and-green is a difficult breed to play with, as it has a unique style and a distinctive personality.
To keep them, we're gonna have to plow the whole game and cover each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he goes around the corner, so we need to keep it compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to be part of the starting lineup in the match against Slavon.
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to be in the starting lineup of the army in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezhov came on the ice in place of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with a score of 0-3 and deflected all the shots on his own goal, the fourth goal SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with a sixth field player.
The team will play their next match away against Slovakia.
I hope to play in the next match in the starting line-up, - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Yezhov.
I'm not an expert on goalies, I'm a goalie, we don't have any repeat shots, so it's hard to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has bad games.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarzova was hospitalized with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
The Czech tennis player is currently in a clinic in Brno.
The timing of the return of the Roland Garros 2015 finalist is unknown.
On Monday, Shafarzova climbed one place in the WTA rankings and is now the fifth best racket in the world.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged onto an Internet messaging service, where he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, discovered the phone was missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She looked it up and found shocking photos, and then immediately brought it to her mother's attention.
The police arrived and saw five images, then searched the computers found at that address and found "appropriate" searches on the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told police that he did it because it would "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a policeman to scare them".
Commissioner Eileen Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making computer queries, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about talking to an unknown man who sent him the pictures and asking to send more pictures.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a headache when he drank and said he wanted to see images of rapes and murders.
"When the girl discovered the photos on her phone", added Mrs. Robertson, "she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and then the defendant had a face-to-face encounter.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of making indecent photographs of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 of this year and failing to appear for his hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defendant's lawyer Gregor Sim has petitioned to exclude Hogg from the list of persons convicted of sexual offences, as it can be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing until October, pending a hearing with social services.
Hogg was released on bail in that case, but was remanded in custody pending the outcome of the other cases.
He was put on the sex offender list before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is giving the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest head of state, fell down the steps leading down the podium earlier this year.
He was not hurt, but a video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary oppositionists that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling at Mugabe during his address.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament, a speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change MP Innocent Gonzalez said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The Members of Parliament were warned that their immunity ended at the Parliament building and once they left, their immunity was no longer valid.
A member of parliament said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting program in the service sector.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly growing hardware and service operations sectors.
The estimated job cuts will result in a net loss of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the portfolio of business lines will be broader and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new business style", Whitman said.
As an individual company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing comprehensive technology solutions previously unattainable" to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is the story of a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto has been called the "birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's second-largest maker of personal computers and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the latest development in the industry, based on the belief that highly specialized companies do better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates should be supporting injured Jack Wilshere ahead of the match against Dynamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September and that provided Wilshire's recovery went as planned, he would be back in action by Christmas.
With the best of the odds, Wilshire will miss at least four of their next four games in England and, given what has happened, their participation in the European Championship next summer remains in doubt.
The most painful thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire had finished the previous season confidently with a single ankle injury and was going to return to his usual aggressive style of play during preseason training.
Wenger: "This injury is not a career threat".
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's not serious.
It was just a coincidence.
It's not related to his ankles or any injuries he's had before.
It could be medical related, but as Wenger has admitted, there is an inherent risk of additional injury for any player returning to play mid-season.
There is also a downside.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most missed days due to injury.
Wenger admits he's likely to get stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you're vulnerable for a while - during that time you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of that, and that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal will begin the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dinamo Zagreb and continue it on Saturday with games against Chelsea and the following Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to make a rotation of the squad.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramzy did not come to Croatia, so most likely Matteo Debyusha and Arteta will play in the starting lineup.
Wenger may also bring in Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Morel and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little break to the players who need it", Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the undisputed favourites in Group F, the Maxim Stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo haven't lost a single game in 41 games since they managed to make it last season as the Invincibles.
Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by a 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is sure Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and are left with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive", Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us some serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially when you consider how desperate men's need for honesty has become more than ever, with suicide rates among young men at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it became the single biggest cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it happens to men three times more often than to women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Lives declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that having a large enough number of friends in a "normal mood" doubles the chances of recovery.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a healthy circle of friends halves the risk of developing mental disorders.
But of course, for a friendship to work, it must first be there.
In an era where communication is driven by social media, where style takes precedence over content, speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives are redoubling our need to appear strong, fun loving, and successful, even when in reality we're lonely.
This superficial success is based on what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of our inner values, our inner drive for personal growth and friendship, which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently pointed out, money can't really buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends is that they bring attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not by their work, but rather by the personality they displayed in their interactions with their friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross's sigh for Rachel -- all come from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one Samaritan employee told me, "...my role as a listener for people who are experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts highlights how even the smallest interaction with friends can be beneficial".
Often the men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old "live with it" lesson is strong, as is the sense that talking about problems openly can be seen as a sign of weakness".
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtleties of male friendship.
As for my job, the status of a stranger on the phone helps people in times of desperation, and long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So if you're going to attend FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the party's been completely remodeled, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk?
Or better yet, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say "Hi".
You never know what good friendship can do.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, with the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG to defeat Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matyuydi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored in the goal of Malmö.
Angel di Maria, making his Champions League debut, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily overtake Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their thing as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League game with a hugely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his first Champions League game as a PSG player to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk's Shakhtar in Group A, Paris needed to get off to a good start in the game against Sweden's champions, as they were aiming not at qualifying for the play-offs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later replace him on the pitch in a game against a team from his hometown and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, to give the opponents problems and play well in defence is a good start, even if there are still points we need to work on during the season", said Blanc.
It's a promising move.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I wish we had scored one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in a substitution in the Paris team, which brought a draw with 2:2 in the match against Bordeaux in the Premier League at the weekend, but was pushed back by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was hailed as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran to pass Marco Verratti behind Malmö's defence and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johan Villard into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage, with nine world-class players in the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two centre-half midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, except for a shot by Nikola Đurđić, when the ball passed the long bar of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
But PSG sometimes let themselves down with unsuccessful passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half failed to make at least five attempts, and then could not process the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the game was resumed.
However, he proved himself much more adept at accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which, having received, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted stroke that went into the barrel past Viland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Kavanagh, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had tampered with a ball sent into the centre of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that "Malmo" had about returning to the game, and only the interception of the ball by Viland from close range prevented David Luis from increasing the final score before Esquel Lavessi, who came on as a substitute, was scored a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmö coach Aage Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year".
Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not that level.
Qualification is not enough.
- Thank you.
It was a great match with them.
Glencore makes $ 2.5 billion selling shares .
Swiss-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, has made $2.5 billion in a stock sale as part of its grand debt-reduction plan.
London-listed Glencore has announced that it has sold some £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with a collapse in commodity prices as China's economic slowdown dampens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
With the newly issued shares at a discounted price, Glencore's London Stock Exchange share price soared in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which was trading 0.69 percent higher at opening.
Glencore last week began a $2.5 billion share sale as part of a sweeping plan to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents a share, or 2.4 percent off the closing price on Tuesday.
It has placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company's authorized capital.
Fears of a further slump in China's economy have reduced the price of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed in an official statement on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit, Xi Jinping's first to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also receive Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at a government luncheon later that evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, and will allow the US and Chinese presidents to constructively address contentious issues", the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the heads of several leading American technology companies en route to Washington, before heading to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyber espionage by China and China's growing assertiveness over the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The man who hit the biker on the Kutuzovsky lihach got 2 years in prison.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims against Denny Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Moscow Dorogomil court sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoyev was sentenced to two years in a penal colony.
He was convicted under the article "Violation of the rules of road traffic and use of transport vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
During the parties' debates, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoyev to three years in prison and to recover from him the full amount of the victims' claims - eight million rubles.
The accident, which is being discussed, occurred on May 22 around three in the morning in the area of the house 30 on Kutuzovsky Avenue.
A BMW car driven by Mirzoyev crossed the opposite lane and hit a motorcyclist standing on the sidewalk.
The man, 1989-years-old, died at the scene.
Friends of the victim on social media reported that the BMW driver was speeding and drove into the opposite lane before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle race from the Sparrow Mountains to the Moscow State Highway Patrol building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly after, it became known that the investigation had arrested the alleged culprit.
A naked man was arrested in Moscow for entering a church.
He was calm and did nothing illegal, so the police referred him to the emergency psychiatric ward.
Moscow police arrested a man who entered a church without clothes on.
This is reported by the Moscow Agency.
According to the head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow Andrey Galiakberov, the incident occurred on Tuesday, September 15, around 16.00, on Kashir Highway.
A naked man entered the church of St. Nicholas.
He was calm and did nothing illegal.
A police team arrived on the scene on call.
Law enforcement waited for emergency psychiatric doctors and handed over the man.
He was a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
Vladimir Yakushev signed more than 40 resolutions and orders.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at the meeting of the regional government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, the funds were allocated to purchase a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhnetovda district, to capital repair of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As the documents say, the money will go toward completing the renovation of the second floor of the therapy unit.
Repairs will be carried out on hot and cold water supply, water supply, electrical networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, the façade of the building will be put in order, the premises will be repaired, a complex of measures will be implemented to prevent fire and energy saving.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, which will be attended by the Tyumen delegation led by the governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation are discussed by Vladimir Shugla, Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, who is part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the objectives of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between regions, which are important links in relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
The plenary and section meetings will discuss the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policy, regulatory and legal support and programs of the Union State.
The forum will be attended by the governor of the Tyumen region.
I think this is a testament to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope the forum will help us conclude new and profitable contracts and agreements.
I should add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tyumen under the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus also shows the importance of our work.
In addition, the Tyumen region's agricultural cooperative delegation visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What were the topics discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus was discussed in the current difficult conditions.
The issue of supplying Belarusian agricultural equipment and using financial mechanisms is touched upon - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
The problems in the work of the Tyumen "Belshina" trading house and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The questions are important because investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
It was discussed further supply of passenger-cargo equipment to OAO "MAZ", development of the service center of OAO "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OAO "TPATP".
The talks also touched upon the preparation of the work delegation of the region to visit the Republic of Belarus before the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement and signing of the agreement on trade-economic, scientific-technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
So the dynamics of the relationship promises to go to a new level.
These issues also concerned the regional center.
During our meeting with Tyumen City Administration Chief Alexander Moore, we discussed the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing perfume", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is needed that will run on gas, an environmentally clean fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading producers of elevator products OAO "Moglievliftmash", obtaining components.
I think this activity could be more active, given the program to install new elevators in the regional center.
I would add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and supplying modern Belarusian equipment to the Urals was discussed.
A meeting with the governor of Omsk is planned for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five Russian subjects, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a rolling field for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good because they allow for the direct and quick resolution of many problems, their resolution and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current environment, it is crucial not to destroy the backbone while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people in filmmaking.
Matt Damon has been in a fight with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnicity is not a factor.
During the Sunday edition of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative perspectives on the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you cast for the movie itself, not the show", Damon insisted.
Brown, stunned, couldn't believe her ears, shouting "Wow! Wow. Wow!" all the while the Martian actor was giving live commentary.
To discuss the show's finalists, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers.
"I would like participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretations of the Harmony image they are going to stick to", Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute being beaten by a white pimp.
Dear White People's producer was in favor of Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio directing the film; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "we may end up getting the wrong thing".
After the discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with negative comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger over the video: "Matt Damon explaining diversity to the only black person in the room is so white it hurts".
The tweet has garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments come at a time when the media's proper coverage of race is the most pressing issue on the public agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, Prince mentioned the move during his presentation of the nominees for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"The albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, the leaders of Black Lives Matter issued a statement in response to a question from Fox News correspondent Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a group of love", the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was among the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior is awarding the first champion
Professional rock climber and waiter Isaac Caldero on Monday night became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show, taking home the $1 million prize.
In this sport show, which has just completed its seventh season, no contestant has ever managed to complete all the obstacle course stages.
In the season finale, two contestants - Calderón and cameraman Jeff Britten - made it to the final round.
The final challenge involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and set the time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior to pass the grueling stage 4, but Caldeiro did it three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After his hard-earned victory, Caldero, who was shocked to have won a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
"It's amazing to think about it, I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year", Isaac told E! about the huge jump in his income.
And then it's like... I never even imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who was the first to cross the finish line, won't get any prize money.
According to the rules, the fastest runner gets the money.
"If there are more than one finisher, the fastest one gets the prize", said Wade.
Although money is a wonderful reward and a life-changing experience, it is still a source of great satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling any resentment about it.
He's happy with what he did.
It got tons of rave reviews from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero to his wife and kids.
Jeff told me, "if I was gonna lose to someone, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return for an eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly overtaking the Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season wasn't exactly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central Division.
Pretending to be nothing more than a distraction, the Tigers won brilliantly Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut a half-game gap to the Houston Astros and finish second in the playoffs in points behind the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return to the F word that eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they come", said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon contributed to the offense, allowing Detroit to score three runs in the first two innings, then adding another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was pitching 6 1/3 innings and gave up three hits.
It was only his third quality start in nine starts.
"I just want to finish the year on a high note", Simon said.
The substitutes can't pitch every game, so I want to get in the game.
Assigned hitter Victor Martinez returned three hits and two RBI for the first time since mid-August.
It was the first three-hitter since the four-hitter against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat", said Osmus.
He showed himself well in batting, was noticeably better at batting and kept that quality for the game.
After scoring three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
Center receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks made a punt and took first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier got a strikeout on a swing from Simon before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed Moyer, the only player in the way, ahead of newly-appointed batter Miguel Sano, who hit a two-run single to the left of right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not out and a comparative second base injury, Verhagen managed to get third baseman Trevor Pluff to a double play.
It was the 27th time for a major league pitcher this season that Pluff hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer earned an RBI double into the outfield space against Tigers closing pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-hander knocked Sano out after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was temporarily out of practice, early in the game.
The Tigers had three hits in the first two innings against a veteran pitcher who was on injured reserve before the game, missing more than a month with a lumbar injury.
"It's definitely not the start I would have liked", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning".
After the first batter reached first base, Hughes threw a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
The walk with two outs by rightfielder J. D. Martinez knocked out Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first hit of the game.
Victor Martinez finished his 0-21 run with the runners in the lead.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed up with a single, bringing in another hit, but Victor Martinez was knocked out trying to get closer to third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning with a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-hour single by center fielder Anthony Goose, making it 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose shots counted, pitched a scoreless third inning, then was replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes has three hits in six at-bats and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez is out with a sprained right shoulder.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and face the Twins.
Norris, who has made four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has one win and one loss.
He has not played since August 20 due to a sprained ankle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) is being played by right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Prayer to God" was received in the South Sakhalin court.
The original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize the book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam" as "extremist material" has been received by the South Sakhalin city court, the "Interfax" reports citing the chairman of the city court Alexander Chuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the case.
Chukhrai refused to comment on statements by some state Duma deputies about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense", he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin city prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the decision of judge Natalia Perchenko to declare the book "extremist material".
The prosecutor's office in South Sakhalin received an appeal on Friday night.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to declare the author's opinion extremist, not the verses of the Koran.
According to the prosecutor, the judge made the wrong decision", said Chukhrai.
The decision to declare the book "extremist material" was made on 12 August 2015.
In particular, quotes from the Koran were called "extremist": "You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help", "Do not invoke anyone along with God".
Kadyrov called the decision-makers of the book "satan and provocateurs".
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to legislate against court decisions concerning the texts of the holy scriptures.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law prohibiting the judicial decision to directly affect the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures", Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook to remove comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook employees are going to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
The social network will also provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat xenophobia and racism on the Internet, Facebook's leadership is working with the German Justice Ministry.
The head of the department, Heiko Maas, said that the ministry is currently working with social media specialists to create a special group of moderators.
Its members are required to monitor and remove comments that are inappropriate towards migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of the intolerant posts will receive notifications stating the reason for their deletion.
Organizations that collect complaints about offensive content from social media users should also help to block illegal content quickly.
Facebook's management is committed to providing them with the financial support they need.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments about migrants and refugees was made by the social network's management and the German Ministry of Justice after a sharp rise in xenophobic sentiment in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for this is the unprecedented migration crisis that has recently hit the European Union.
For example, in Germany, all the places where refugees are being taken are already overcrowded.
The day before, the authorities decided to temporarily settle the migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held during the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation zones in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several of the city's cemeteries will be equipped with specialised areas for relaxation and psychological recreation.
Among the first will be the Butev, Domodedovo, and Shcherbin cemetery.
The first zone for psychological recreation has already appeared at Troyekurovsky Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will be built in other areas of the city.
This was reported by Artem Yekimov, head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation areas will be small, green areas that resemble parks.
According to experts, such "corners" provide visitors with a place to relax, be alone, and recover psychologically.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovo, Butov and Shcherbin cemetery, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the State Forestry Bureau "Ritual", when it becomes necessary to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest masses in the maximum possible volume.
The green space will serve as a living fence that will separate the rest areas from the areas set aside for the burial grounds.
The experts of the State Bureau of Rituals also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon fences on burials.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the Ritual State Administration said it is ready to install electronic terminals that will allow visitors to the cemetery to find out the GPS coordinates and number plates of the graves.
In June this year, the Ritual State Administration also proposed to adjust the cost of funeral services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a week in the winter, when the ground is frozen.
In the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom was found in the Elnin forest.
The elderly man was found alive, although he had spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without food.
The discovery of the mountain-fungus was made possible by the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the forest".
No food or water.
He was searched by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dog-dogs, but no results.
The man was located after a helicopter joined the search.
That day, Vitaly Alexandrovich went to the forest for the optas and the underbrushes, but by evening he did not return.
The next day, rescuers and a group of about 30 people from a nearby village were called in to search for the mushroom.
On the fifth day, a fire and rescue helicopter joined them.
Andrei Seletskov, head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was brought in, the man was found".
He's gone too far, to a whole other place.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search area.
He's come a long way at his age.
He survived by a miracle.
The fungus was taken to the central district hospital in Elna, unconscious, in a very serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed pneumonia, severe dehydration, and hypothermia.
How an elderly man managed to stay alive after five days in the woods is beyond the doctors' imagination.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Central Hospital of Elin: "The patient is being examined, treated".
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic conditions.
The patient's condition has improved this morning, remains severe, but positive.
Retired man Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolensk every year from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had been a mushroom picker before, but he had never gone far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the mushroom, said: "The forest is not far from the road, it is not local".
For years, I've been coming to visit my relatives.
Well, I went to get some mushrooms.
Must have gone far and got lost.
With the onset of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Five cases in the last few days alone.
Rescuers remind you to walk into the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches, and a compass.
It's also a good idea to leave a trail of footprints so you can go back.
The emergency An-2 crashed into a crossroad in the brotherly taiga.
Right on the crossroads of Siberia, an An-2 crashed.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself sustained significant damage upon landing.
An-2 was on a business flight.
The plane was carrying three crew members - the commander, co-pilot and a boartmechanic, Interfax reports.
The accident aircraft was flying on the route of Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsk - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew has already been brought to Bratsk.
The Brotherhood Transport Prosecutor's Office has begun a review of flight safety legislation following the crash of the An-2.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office has arrived at the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed its passenger aircraft due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taaj airfield in Komi.
The ship's engines and onboard electronics failed, but the crew did the impossible.
The plane was carrying 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was hurt in the emergency landing.
The Nobel Prize winner in economics: globalization
Printing Globalization was supposed to reduce inequality in the world.
The reality is that the income gap in the developing economies is actually growing.
I'm not going to lie.
To remedy this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Muskin, chief scientist of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Making at HSE, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries were becoming more open.
Advocates of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And these predictions have largely come true", Muskin points out.
So, for example, China and India have had some serious GDP growth per capita.
But things are not so rosy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which is reflected in large income inequality, or more specifically, wage inequality.
But in reality, the inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article "Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by HSE.
Eric Muskin, along with Harvard economist Michael Kremer, has developed an alternative theory that explains why income inequality in poor countries is increasing as globalization increases, the HSE said.
The new global market is undergoing specific processes.
To illustrate this, Muskin identifies four levels of expertise: A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries are not qualified enough to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if the C-level workers in poor countries are getting higher wages because of the cooperation with the B-level workers in rich countries, then the D-level workers are not getting any growth or their wages are going down.
The end result is that the internationalisation of production will contribute to a widening of the pay gap between the two categories of workers in poor countries and, consequently, to an increase in inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, associate professor, head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Decision Making, and head of the Mathematics Department at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves do not have the means, and it is not profitable for companies to pay for their training, he says.
Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role in this, Muskin said.
The scientist notes that the theory developed by no means calls for the cessation of the process of globalization, which has brought and brings its fruits in the form of growth of the GDP of countries.
The Derbent: a living link to the times.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of the festival includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of the past, an exhibition of derbent carpets and the Day of Open Churches, a historical-musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
The medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, the ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and palace gardens - all this is as if from the pages of "A Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern planters that grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Jummah mosque is several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - Monuments of Living Nature".
The shade of the splayed crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque are poured with fragrant tea and treated to Dagestan delicacies - honey fig, dates, mushy mushrooms, miracle buns, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, large samovars have been used for centuries to serve tea to numerous guests.
The inscription above the entrance to the Jumma mosque says that the building was built in 115 AH.
That's 733 in the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in its scale and solemnity: the arcades of the domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the sun's rays from tiny windows.
Keeping and breeding pigeons is a traditional hobby of the people of Derbent.
Owners of birds put pigeons in their yards, under trees, in attics.
A spectacular sight is the flight of flocks of white doves, which resemble the flashes of a festive fireworks display.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Leaving 500 meters into the sea, this structure locked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
The carpets in Derbent were woven as early as the fifth century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged to this day.
On one of the streets near the city market, carpets for every taste are sold - wool, cotton, or velvet rugs of all colors and shades, with or without fur, with elaborate ornamentation and a whimsical frame.
The city began to be built with magali - quarters with one-story stone buildings.
The Mughals have hardly changed in years.
Only the satellite dishes, the air conditioners on the walls and the street lamps remind you that you are not in a medieval city, but in a modern one.
The old part of the city still has parts of a water supply system built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
The ancient springs have survived to this day, and the local people still draw water from them.
Many Derbent people prefer tap water to water from proven historic fountains.
Derbent was one of the centers of pottery making.
Cast and painted vases, dishes, jars, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
Potters still make fine ceramic objects for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On festival days, crowds gather under the tightened rope, where the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of this amazing and risky craft goes back several centuries.
The new trend is to see more girls among the rope walkers.
The former Maiden Bath now houses the Museum of Ancient Derbent Culture and Life.
In the past, unmarried girls and brides bathed here accompanied by their girlfriends, but now anyone can see the vaulted-domed hall, hot and cold swimming pools, and swimming accessories.
Most homes in Derbent have hot water, but the baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the past.
The benefits of steam heating are well documented in ancient books.
After bathing, the blood pressure improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body becomes more flexible and light.
The festival "Sodruzhestvo", which takes place in the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethnic groups from many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing songs of the Caucasus peoples and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid down their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The yellowing sarcophagi are carved from complete stone blocks and oriented, as is customary among Arabs, along the west-east axis.
The brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barber shop has been in this location for years.
The techniques of the barbering trade are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the brothers Jacobov can make not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, the house in which the writer-decembrist Alexander Bestuzev-Marlinsky lived, exiled to the Caucasus, has been preserved.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and everyday life of the city.
The teahouse is a traditional Oriental club, serving only tea and home-baked goods.
Men come here to quench their thirst, to socialize with friends and to solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not allowed to enter the teahouse.
The Derbent "Caspius" dance ensemble was founded three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events at the national and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, perfectly learning the folk dances of Avar, Dargin, Tatar, Armenian.
As the evening comes, when the noise subsides and the street lamps are lit, the locals sit on benches near the terraced houses.
Usually, the Derbent people discuss household matters.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they are increasingly recalling episodes of their city's unique history, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
A business "airport game" was held in Domodedovo.
The capital is experimenting with a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried out for airport workers.
For this purpose, models of three airports were installed in Domodedovo.
The young men not only inspected and checked the passengers but also serviced the planes.
All this in the form of a business game, but it was not inferior in complexity to reality.
Flights delayed, two passengers with fractures on board, a landing gear lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
It's hell for a real airport.
For the one who settled in Domodedov's hangar, it's a standard set of tasks for the newcomers to solve.
One hangar accommodated three major airports from different countries.
Today, four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities work in them.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of the airfield.
Passenger registration, aircraft service, luggage handling - even buses at the airport, ramps, and passenger inspection were entrusted to them.
And the passengers are all trouble.
One had a bad case of papers, another missed his flight, the third filled his bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with it like you do in life, in the shortest possible time.
For each of these tasks they perform, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if the airline had paid them a corresponding amount for the service.
"They are fined for not fulfilling their tasks", explains game financial analyst Dmitry Hilko in an interview with the program "Vesti-Moscow".
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring the situation.
For them, the exam is a test run of a new form of learning.
She's already got a place in the vocational secondary school.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment", - says the director of the Department of State Policy in the field of training of working personnel and additional professional education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia Natalya Zolotareva.
But students are not up to the global plans.
After three days of this kind of training, they're gonna need a day off.
But the grades on this exam were quite material.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding to a complaint about our airport on Instagram", said Sergey Shuvalov, a participant in the game and PR manager for the Frankfurt Airport team.
The best judges, as they were called, were hired to pencil in and ask to be hired by the time they graduated.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia has expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Embassy Center at the M.I. Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow .
"The recent unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation call into question the Russian government's commitment to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been broken even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of our relations", US Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement to the Interfax news agency.
The American Center has created deep and lasting connections between the people and cultures of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place for numerous prominent American figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians, and writers.
"Only last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50 thousand Russian visitors", the diplomat stressed.
Teft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to execute.
Typical situation: Four officials stand in front of the desk of Judge Swatantra Kumar, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is not at all satisfied with the quality of your work.
"We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of", says Kumar.
If one more brick is laid, we'll order the entire structure to be torn down.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal has handled more than 10,000 lawsuits involving air pollution, garbage collection, mining, toxic waste, and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction of the building that causes pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: In less than 60 years since independence, India has gone from a country of pristine jungle to one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure development is lagging behind rapid urbanization: cities are covered in thick smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cleared for new housing developments.
Despite the state's formal support for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, the environment minister called the court's decisions "extreme" and "impossible".
Sometimes court decisions are not enforced within the time limit, says environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, there is a positive side to unfulfilled deadlines: At least they make those in charge move.
"His main goal is to overturn the system", adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major construction projects, including the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
People are also being ignored, as in the case of a pharmaceutical company in Telangana that contaminated a local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar said of his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people whose lives can be changed by a single stroke of the judge's pen.
In April, the tribunal banned all vehicles over 10 years old from entering the capital, sparking public outrage.
Despite the sharp drop in popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatantar Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi government on incoming and outgoing bus traffic and offered to buy 10,000 additional buses, having first checked with the factories whether they could fulfill such an order.
As the court began to focus on pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality, and even traffic accidents, public anger began to subside.
But the most sickening topic of the principled judge was the Ganges River cleanup program, announced with pomp by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a river sacred to Hindus, the judge often loses his temper and screams.
Do you know what the word "saint" means?
"Someone poured water from the Ganges into the statue of God, and it turned out to be feces", the judge said.
You keep polluting the river because you think Gang is Gang, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The cleanup of the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the amount of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times the normal amount.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindus who bathe there die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganga Rescue Fund the proceeds from the sale of his suit in which he met Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700,000 dollars, while at least eight billion dollars are needed to clean the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as an unacceptable luxury", says Call of the Gang activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court tries to find a middle ground between environmentalism and development".
A man bleeds through several Dalí paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists exhibition in Riga broke windows in the museum and damaged Salvador Dalí's sculpture "The Appearance of an Angel".
The museum now houses an exhibition of Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man, born in 1985, entered the sculpture hall at 14:20.
He was inadequate, he damaged the sculpture, he broke the windows.
Then he started moving around the premises and stained several works in the permanent exhibition with blood.
Among them is a portrait of the Order of the Brush of Miervaldis Polis.
According to the president of the Latvian Union of Artists Igor Dobychin, to whom "Interfax" refers, the windows were also damaged.
Police and art experts are working on the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A man has been charged with hooliganism.
The Latvian Union of Artists is holding an exhibition of Picasso and Dali's work from August 4 to September 27, which features more than 200 original works by the artists.

Xi calls for more open economy for the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group tasked with leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an open policy", he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group Committee on Comprehensive Reforms.
He said that expanding openness and deepening reforms would give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including regulating investors' access to the market, changing border control rules, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital and revising the registration system for residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and manufacturing will be made unavailable for investment.
The system will be gradually tweaked through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more significant role in allocating resources, ensuring legitimacy in business and increasing transparency, the statement said.
The government will also weaken the controls it gives to companies, thereby ensuring that companies run their own businesses.
The statement also said China would allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More areas will be open to private investors to increase the transparency of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better conditions", the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or a green card, will be further simplified by optimizing requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
