below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lion are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called herds.

The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like herds with wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-rounder, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a phrase of murmuring, screaming words.
Ozelot likes to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ozelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (bait) by smell, by sniffing on the ground where they are.
They can see very well in the dark with their dark vision and they can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by fusing into their surroundings and then jumping over the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small stock) is separated from the main stock from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often ends up in an environment different from the one in which it was previously found.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
n an, as the new population starts to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen as humans breathe and they take up carbon dioxide as humans exhale.
Plant produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, much of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals can't survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its day, so it had nothing to fear, except for other mosasaurs.
Long jaws were possessed with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the jaw, meaning that there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a cleft tongue. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came down into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.

Another difference was that while the poor men and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could lie half-aside while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
They had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.

For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
still being made today, but more important is its image ratio inherited from the format of photo sensors in digital cameras.
35 mm is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) correspond to or are close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-ridiculated rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in a picture.

During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being investigated.

Its ubiquitous power affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.

During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit in the highest chair in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
furthermore, the professions were opened up to all aspiring men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to make a success of their own.
The same is true for the military, where rank in the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to make a revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He used to visit a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on the ""Noor"" mountain (light) to meditate".
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
t is not easy to find even if you know it exists inside the cave it is totally isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing today.

"The Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great sphinx".
The Cheops Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The mark for the ""up-strip"" looks like a V and the mark for the ""down-strip"" looks like a clamp or a square that lacks a bottom side".
Up means you should start at the tip and push the straw up, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the straw) and pull the straw down.
A high pitch usually generates a softer sound, while a low pitch is stronger and more resolutely.
You can draw your own markings, but remember that the printed bar markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a bunch of market women.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open at the gavel.
On one occasion, one of the mob members waved his head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the frightened queen.
The war costs of the US imperialist conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
of course, the great profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the temple lords, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time period in which the events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history during the 11th to 14th centuries.

Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by a basic logic that is related to the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technological development itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are indigenous, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that the motorized car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
though a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small number of cars, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Car accidents are also increasing, leading to new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romance contained a large element of determinism originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.



It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic reached its zenith between the 11th and 12th centuries.


n the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.One of the biggest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
self-sustaining farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
self-farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with alternate farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical nature, or it can be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
one of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called ""wild"". Some wild children have been incarcerated by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all by themselves.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to the specific pet, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
e project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support learning goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support to individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it's also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalised in the software and is intended to question, guide and explain methods which may have been too challenging for the learner to cope with on his/her own.
children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
no child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing or educating, but it does happen.
We feel the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our family home system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
adoptive homes exist to provide all the essentials that were missing in the home they came from.
Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are proposed as important drivers for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
""Personal engagement""continuous relationships"" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that last for a few milliseconds.
It is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
"Oliver Sacks, in his article ""The President's Speech"" showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection takes it out of the pool of pronounced variation.
segregação e recombinação, que oscila variações entre os dois pólos para cada nova geração.
out in the savannah, it's hard for a primate with a digestive system like ours to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants that are available.
Plus, the lack of this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and bark, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In comparison, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also offers high quality proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
"After all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do in the savanna today".
Sleep apnea is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (1060 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock which brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
if you're used to turning off your clock when you sleep, you can set it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known fluid-disperser) before bed, which causes you to have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.

Tibet Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of love in the Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple.It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.

Germany was a common enemy during WWII, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, differences in systems, processes and culture led to the collapse of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought physically by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.

The most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans is to use ships to transport goods.
The job of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
one of the most notable late examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. the Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help the UK.
t, the German fleet, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.

Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used them to produce milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamgetter were usually kept in huts that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often felled by shepherds who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more famous sheep herder.


Sliders were introduced early to keep the tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became a practice, but the iron was more on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Gradually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people started walking upright 2 million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
"Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
one was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use computer jargon.
Poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of poisoning might be an open can of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bugs" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient relatives of bed bugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both beetles and bed bugs are resident, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and spinal cord.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is the guideline in almost all research.
experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotelis's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
periodic rhythms which are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first hints that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments that either marked the DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.


In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. basically everybody complains about transportation systems.

Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because the processing cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.

To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
This is helpful for the planning, design and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to drop their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't drop their wings are the trolllands and the daylands.

The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything was made up of one or more of a total of four elements.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals.Remember, there are many different elements in the periodic table.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.

The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, slicing the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.

Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
Theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they want and what in their environment is what makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can appear when managers start leading their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain "one in the gang".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become a non-identifiable person who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
often have more to say about than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by local management.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".

why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? one goal of starting to use organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organisation's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it makes that research field narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI is closely associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and also handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
like this has become a separate discipline, focused on offering solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now widely used in finance, medicine, technology and the military, and have been incorporated into several home computer and TV game software applications.
Field studies are a big part of teaching in every classroom. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers solutions with virtual study visits where students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
shared study trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennet school in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are allowed to remain online as a clipping book.
