Barack Obama is the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, the medal and the $1.4 million cheque will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolitan in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet with the five members of the committee that, in October, chose him between 172 people and 33 organizations.
After that, the presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with Norwegian king Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
The visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, although the third will receive him in his office.
The White House has already announced that, after receiving the prize, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently in war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and another 250 guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not deserving it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for everyone who struggle for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Nature Defender Accused of Chantage
The police of Litoměřice accused the president of the civil association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Litoměřice Society of Nature Defenders) of chantage.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded investors money for their own benefit, litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Society of Defensiers of Nature Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently imprisoned and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate the waste.
In Prague, citizens can separate packaging of drinks and in the southern Moravia villages can be found containers to separate waste everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don’t want to say that the waste is not separated for anything in Brno.
I think, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is completely delayed in the separation of waste, not only because we, citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw in the center a PET bottle to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I’ve found so far is in the Moravské náměstí square, in front of the Potrefená Huse.
Don’t be angry with me Mr. Onderka and his comrades, but that seems to me too little.
It is not necessary to mention that in other places it is not easy to separate the waste.
This is why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
by Vagance
But the containers are far away.
I am not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several bottles of glass and plastic into the waste.
But on the Kaunicova Street I saw no red container nearby.
Fortunately, going to the train I found the right place.
However, the waste was already removed from the container.
It remains the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics don’t seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which shame us throughout the republic, and do not buy more containers nor offer the separation of other matters so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little bit, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
Paroubek’s budget removed money from income and disease subsidies
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may be no enough money in the budget for income, disease subsidies or for construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the rise for some groups, they trusted that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or disease subsidies. "This only implies delaying the problems for the future, it is placing mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you take money borrowed, you have to pay increasingly high interests and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state has not many options to get money.
If you do not reduce the social subsidies or the state’s operating expenses, you have to increase the taxes.
To all whom the left added now: the firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later his children too.
People don’t have to worry about the income or disease subsidies, they’ll receive them.
But the price to be paid will be the rise of the public debt; the next year will not be missing in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will continue to increase alongside interest expenditure.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity subsidies, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the displacements of the money in the benefit of some group of voters, the next year will also lack five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
It is, above all, of the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price can not be reduced either.
The greatest thing you can do is to keep them, which is not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large buildings; the possibility of getting European funds is also in danger, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a solomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bag without fund.
Last year, ČEZ was allocated to the budget of 18 billion.
Each year the dividends are liquidated environmental damages, serve to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the prepared income reform.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant several compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or for disputes expenses, even in construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It is a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we may have to pay it, says Janota.
After that, the Minister will have to save money within the resource or, in the worst case, take hand to the government's budget reserve.
It already lacks a hundred million for the Státní pokladna (State Cash) project, the price of which is two billion and which has already been initiated.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will work with two operating systems
The Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just one key, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Exactly this possibility is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of computer virtualization software.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and U.S. operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during the year 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns hotels
Not only the teleskop keepers in Krkonoše are concerned about snow-free pistes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas and Christmas.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but they’re still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas will be snow or shadows," said the informative portal Spindl.Info keeper Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in Spindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations, shouldn't hesitate more to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait a few days more.
Spindlerův Mlýn hosts offer mostly weekly stays for Christmas.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer Christmas in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
They are sold very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the pistes remain snowful during the week, Christmas dates will be exhausted as well," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it’s a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was harder.
We are about 5 percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well,” said director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Christmas holidays are already occupied in the Omnia hotel, near the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the newest Janské Lázně hotel in Christmas the half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, as we are approximately 60 percent of the occupation capacity.
February has been slightly weaker, but as soon as snow falls, the interest in the stay in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that Krkonoše’s hotelmakers will go through the desires of snow waiting.
The temperatures should fall on Thursday and, if there are precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will again rise, said Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
US: Repeat is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the most intelligent man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the most stupid.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, hoped with anxiety, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text the phrase "like in Iraq" is used several times, but it has also not failed to use the title of Bush's January 2007 declaration for his own declaration: "A new way forward."
He himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering by the civil war.
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing is spoken about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation didn't improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than he could expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the captain-in-chief of the Afghan operation general Stanley McCristal. He, even despite the traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecised gunmen in the White House to a hard criticism.
He asked 40,000 people to improve the situation.
The president vacillated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he deceived the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to make Europe promise to him another 5,000, although he himself previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic of all Obama’s strategy seems to be his goal, starting to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and ending this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase gives the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal wars in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinaryly complicated due to confused relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even setting a state that is “capable of action”, a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy is shocked by his volunteerism.
During the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who doesn’t know anything about reality, can believe that the soldiers sent to the war so that they’ll “return home soon”, will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, fixing the date of the withdrawal of the troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it as an indirect declaration of the U.S. defeat.
The last NATO summit demonstrated that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don’t know, nor want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions do not have any effect on the Iranians, the U.S. will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers exactly when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic reverse for the situation in Afghanistan.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential election and therefore there is still a lot of time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the hard criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs became the leader in the effort to unite the Wall Street bonuses with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it must take, said former JPMorgan bank investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank faced the criticism after having outsourced $17 billion ( CZK 300 billion) for the bonuses, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of the bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, the $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate topic in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record on a single time, with a 50 percent tax, bank bonuses that exceed £25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all categories less Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among the awards was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman awarded, was Physics.
This award was awarded today by scientists Charles Kao for the research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which constitutes the basis of all digital cameras, fax or telescopes.
Each prize winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the event that there are several awards in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel, the Peace Prize, was received today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of being awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy he added, however, that in certain situations the wars are essential to peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation.Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is raising his stay in the government, since he is not in agreement with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is supposed that the budget, and also Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too big, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
The meeting was announced by President Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the position, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives, however, approved on Wednesday the left's proposals for fund transfers and increased the money for official salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they secretly make the budget deficit increase.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a serious internal policy conflict occurred. Due to this conflict, the future activities of the Fischer bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party, begin to be controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of savings, imposed in autumn by Fischer’s government to freeze public debt.
Klaus can but doesn’t have to sign the state budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians took a long time discouraging “the serious problem”, i.e. the “not sustainable deficit” of public assets.
He says he has no better solution anymore.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is scary and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences".
Chief of the CSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is scary, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government.
On Wednesday, ČSSD said the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
People were also happy.
Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invencible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some criticisms say the protagonist roles are played by American actors.
The story talks about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The untouchable fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by an Oscar-winning American actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I said, “When you interpret you, I’ll have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the abolition of slavery movement, which ended up being a slave, of the fictitious U.S. president, and even of God in Evan All-Powerful.
He spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who united his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country.
He believes he is able to unite his people through the sport, and that’s why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong in the world to the outsiders.
The South African team reached the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela's story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it would be as similar to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, and be among the backs before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to stretch his hand to Mandela.
I discovered that by stretching your hand, I received your energy, this is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was, when he finally met for the first time with Pienaar at his home.
I remember having called the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: "In the movie I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invencible received positive reviews and is also talking about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation with these words: "It was a very good story, a very good film made."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received a 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of the splendor on Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
On Norway a special lighting effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Defence Ministry acknowledged yesterday that near the border with Norway it made tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The missile, "Bulava" type, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even their repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or a failure in the air occurred.
In Russian newspapers they write about "Bulavá" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn’t fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problem occurred at the beginning.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the apparatus.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated immersed in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the launch from a ship that is moving and is immersed at the same time.
That’s why the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, is likely to actually be the failed “Bulavá”.
The Norwegians even from the beginning didn’t hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves saying that one can’t just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile ended and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines disrupted immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches passed completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost a fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and therefore they continue to say that "Bulavá" one day will fly without problems and that it will even succeed in carrying up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow CSKA at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will again present himself at the age of 51 at a professional hockey meeting.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly will play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal matters, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club coach.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to raise the mood of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice pistes, he will become the longest professional player in Russian hockey.
The legendary frontman Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty and one, throughout the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The biggest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he had successes also in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won twice the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hall of Glory of Hockey.
Hyundai Complies Trade Unions Requirements Will Cancell All Additional Work
The head of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all the additional work.
Exactly because of the frequent supplementary work, the trade unions announced Monday the strike emergency.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The board, however, wants to agree with the trade unions for this year a further round of Saturday.
We can’t resign our manufacturing plan, as it’s essential. That’s why we proposed voluntary additional work for Saturday, December 19, that’s, it’s going to work in two rounds, Vaněk said.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on Saturday's turn.
The bonus will also be paid on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or can take a free day on December 28, i.e. extend the Christmas holidays in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
Moreover, all employees of the Saturday turn will receive money for the trip and for food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the trade unions and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the direction yesterday afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vaněk mentioned.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour turnings and this situation lasted practically every day until last week.
After the agreement is signed, the trade unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unions should be held on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they commit to complying with the requirements and the document was signed, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the car factory worsened last week Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously entered strike for the frequent additional jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management said employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The trade unions in their statement on Monday’s strike also demanded that no one of the employees, who interrupted the manufacturing last Wednesday, would be penalized in any way.
In terms of supplementary work, trade unions require the company to reduce it to the minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The automotive factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The production in series began in November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even In 'Called' HIV Virus
The team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drugs-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medications are already available.
AIDS cannot be cured so far.
However, the life of patients can be significantly extended thanks to a mixture of medications that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medications no longer work.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used today, and therefore they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work the scientists find new, ‘better’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumin of the virus.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyder cages composed of the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms are united by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and it is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fraction of the HIV virus and mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we stop also the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry the scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see the table) are united by a short organic series, which remains being systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective.
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed in probeta, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medications, however they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, in which the medications often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metalocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for the next year is "surprising" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think of his future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether in the House of Deputies he wants to support the minority, who tries to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Representatives approved the budget for 2010, but with the changes proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government rejected the proposals of ODS, as they coverly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS before the vote came out of the hall and so fulfilled the government's desire, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and Inutility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and the feeling of inutility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened with his resignation in case of approval of the amendments, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He said he is thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is their disappointment for the budget negotiations.
If Fischer is in agreement with another struggle against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government have nothing to do the nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say, if he will resign, if the Chamber approves other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that refer to disease subsidies, income, or the amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not guilty
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries in the lugartenient positions there are people belonging to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public stock, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is backed on the left majority, which is currently in the House of Deputies."
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the ODS members.
I haven’t thought about that, when it’s time, I’ll take care of it,” Defense Minister Martin Barták told reporters at the House of Representatives, who was named for the government precisely by ODS members.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS resigns at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas emphasized that ODS on Wednesday in the House of Deputies likely would vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask the ODS members to allow the acceptance of the budget.
We don't feel like orphans, we're not small children, he responded to the question, if ODS doesn't worry about the absence of the party leader in the parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget talks.
I did not realize that my vote was missing.
At the resignation of the mandate he knew, that in the following months it would be mainly the bolchevization of the House of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of ČD, fewer trains will circulate for almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain, for example, the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pendolino.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not return to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains on the trail Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice will also be canceled and some fast trains on the trail Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced to just a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the surroundings of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at the Prague Main nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From December 13 the travellers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
Regional Railways account for this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains dráhy have a new contract of ten years, so far the contract was always one year.
Dráhy is pleased with the system, and that’s why they didn’t increase the prices of a large majority of the bills.
Changes will only occur on one-day bills - ČD Net and on cheap eLiška internet bills.
For travelers without customer card the price of ČD Net will rise from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 crowns for trips between any two regional cities.
Philippines Armed Forces Arrest More than 50 People, Children Released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was by AFP, which previously only about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the southern province of Agusan.
They say about 19 armed forces use the prisoners as a living shield in the escape before the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining prisoners.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously pursued the kidnappers due to violence, whose cause was the adjustment of accounts between two clanes of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was due to the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 murder, related to the governor's elections, were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of involvement in the killing they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
Muslim separatists operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, they on Tuesday renewed peace talks with the Philippines government.
The history of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech isInvictus: Neporažený), will be released in the American cinemas, capturing a part of the biography of former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-known anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago for the role protagonist Mandela himself.
The second role, the one of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of the critics and the public
by Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa culminate preparations for the world championship in football. At the same time the media are shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reserves against the distribution of the protagonist roles by the "less interesting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman says he’s proud of the movie.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared me well to play it.
Many times I met personally with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, perose refers to everyone, he added.
Dressed by the National Rugby Team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years separate. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the playground.
By entering the grass on the costume, which in RSA is considered as something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago gained great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will succeed in helping people join and form a nation, named rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tension situation in the RSA improves.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as said for example in a recent interview to LN a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled from his country to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformator worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire has caught a transformator from the company Čeps in a switch box near the Výškov village in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the Ustí region firefighters, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted the transformator to be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinctive matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformator's shortcircuit.
There were no injured, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokeswoman, the failure does not put the safe operation of the distribution system in danger.
The damage is estimated to be several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is shut down.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the transformator destroyed by a new.
During the ten years of the activity of Čeps nothing similar happened, the failures of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the ČEZ society for the Northern Czech Republic, the power supply was not cut, and the fire of the electric subway did not affect the operation of houses, offices or.
A.s. Čeps worked on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive retailer of the distribution system, of the electric drive of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 interruptor boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electric energy of the transmission system to the distributor system, and alsoins the electric drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura will present a complaint for calumnia to three Hettmans of ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will present a complaint for calumnia to three social-democratic heterosexuals.
It is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and the hetman of Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company’s efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended with signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are "taking the passes of the cake", yet we only get the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true.We know the prices of České dráhy, which were fixed last week.
There is nothing else left for us to defend ourselves.
It’s for the calumnia toward the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence of all regions. according to him, no necessary measures have been taken in harmony with European law.
This is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am ready to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I call on the other Hettmans to do so as well.
I suppose, that this occasion will also be clearly demonstrated, that Mr. Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week, that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose goal would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional railways and for the commission of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call for a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura says he has been threatened by a member of the ČSSD, because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we do not leave it, we may lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know, what he is about, I won’t say his name, Jančura said today to Radiožurnál.
The vaccine will be free and voluntary.
The pneumoccal vaccine from January will end the usual customs.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions, that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcus vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices of the vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have already made it clear in the vaccine procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born from August 2, last year will be free of charge to receive the pneumoccal vaccine.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine too.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth months of child's age.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily allowed their children to vaccinate against pneumococcus.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Generally, experts estimate, that insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without embrace they will save in treatment, which is needed for non-vaccinated children.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s vaccination.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
The pneumococcus is the cause of middle otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the pneumoccal infections in our country every year die according to the research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the covered pneumococal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
But at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and volunteer companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civic association Nahlas.
His association has spread pneumoccal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to at least this.
I think this is the way we now have to take, Kalovsky mentioned.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccine procedure against pneumococcus.
At this point we don’t think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
The President of the Society of Pediatrists Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges, that voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
“In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision of having initiated the vaccine as voluntary,” says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect, that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents leave their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumoccal vaccine is a great change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on the prevention, to save then on the treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Deputies, however, were afraid, that insurance companies could “sack the money from health insurance.”
Doctors therefore will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in theft of a museum"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The police of Pennsylvania says Alfonso Frank Frazetta was trapped while loading 90 paintings on his vehicle and his remolque.
They say Frazetta and another man used an excavator to float in the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81 years old, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The news agency Associated Press that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP that an unidentified police official said a family dispute could have motivated the young Frazetta.
Frazatta, a 52-year-old son, told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a deposit."
The agency said Frazetta father refused to have granted such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increase in Budget
The ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure cuts in the report prior to the budget, facing criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "disappeared" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cutting, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for damaging low and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a top of 1% in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have regretted that low wages workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow around three billion pounds per year, has angry the business community, which says this is an employment tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of the report before the budget
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, from April 2011
Economy will turn more than expected 4.75% this year
50% tax on bankers’ bonds
1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms
Tax degradations for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension increases by 2.5%
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who wins £30,000 will lose £90 a year and who wins £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who wins £10,000 a year will earn £110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 implies "hard decisions", but they insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would rise over 5% of the highest wages.
The Finance Minister, Stephen Timms, denied that tax raises and delineated expenditure cuts were a "sand grain in the desert" compared to what was needed.
“This will allow us to cut the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party’s forecasts regarding future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and the rapidity with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said that the economy would probably contract at a 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decrease predicted in April, while the loan order would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
“The Waste of Opportunity”
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the Labour party’s “duty crisis”, said the project of £789 billion loan application for the next six years was unstable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" avoiding the difficult options until after the elections that should be held in June 2010.
“They have not included anything significant about what they’ll do,” said the minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. “They had the opportunity to do so and they’ve wasted it.”
“All important announcements will be made after the elections, wins who wins.”
by Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a greater short-term deficit reduction.
But the Liberal Democrats affirmed that the money collected by tax increases and expenditure cuts would be used to sustain the next year’s expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, argumenting that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the ads, such as the increase in inflation of some incapacity subsidies in the next month of April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to allegations of electoral maneuver, since the money could simply be recovered the next year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the most people need it and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
“False Budget”
Although ministers did not publish the expenditure data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respective Institute of Fiscal Studies said the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really delaying the pain for further,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All important announcements will come after the election, wins whoever wins,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s economic consultant.
"This has been the false report before the budget. markets realize this."
FBI investigates “American demands in Pakistan”
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a ride to a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are of Pakistani descendence, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and in what kind of circumstances they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing,” the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncle.
He said the house was already in the eye of the local police and that the detainees had not yet been charged.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, Reuters, but said the U.S. had to “work closer with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students their disappearance in North Virginia, in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abus"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report from the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details the "models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said they had hit him and burned him with cigarettes.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election caused the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Hundreds of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, recognized some accusations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to criticism, according to our correspondent.
“False Confession”
Amnesty International quoted the report of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the result of the election.
“Sometimes they hit me in the face,” according to his words.
“I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and abandoned on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the accusations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detained, who said he was returned in a container along with another 75 people for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judicial power had established committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and the parliamentary committees' findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent more demonstrations.
A ski track was made in the city park.
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site into a competition track.
The Pista at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the pending at the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, facing a 100 meters long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that was quite scary.
You see below a beautiful view of the city's lights titling.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent," he added.
The awards were delivered to the best tricks or maneuveres performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be drowned.
They and We
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a state.
In a time when Swiss voters have requested the ban on minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually integrating) into one of the most openly laic societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s latest work “Why the French Don’t Like Headcarves” (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are perceived still today.
Mr. Bowen’s last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim Marry in a Mosque or in a City Council (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
They are these apparently worldly issues, he says, things of everyday life, those that worry the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imam, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim academic and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern laic society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interview tend to be in disagreement with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French laicism could be compatible.
Adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questiones how far the French political strategs (and the intellectual elite that so ferociously defends laicism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “a value adjustment.”
After reading this book, one tends to say “Yes, but still not.”
The most disappointing landscape in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is flooding at an alarming speed, bringing with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In “On Thin Ice” Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and the policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value facing the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a courageous 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his mosquito, is a myth, but others are true.
The children, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoologists and circles.
A circus presentation at the beginning of the 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the zoo areas are still generally one millionth part of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore put itself green by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of its pelage.

Ellis recurs to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorcycle skymal Indians use high-power assault rifles to throw down their prisoners.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last for longer.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and scary story about the Arctic science and a overwhelming look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It is not because of lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering trips at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines traced a map of the moving ice cords that circulate under the ice masses.
Satellite exploration and extensive series of sondes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, diminished world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by salt water flakes that are compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, what is believed can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, these could be us.
Marines among the 6,000 who put crowns on Arlington's tombs
De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to give tribute to men and women who once stood on their boats.
In a few months, from where they are boarding us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are ours, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the veteran tombs in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already a 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs on the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the United Airlines Flight 93 commemorative site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career military deceased.
As long as his husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way to give a remuneration to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It’s like visiting a family tomb.
Envolved in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the wide prades and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers went to older tombs from the First World War, the Second World War, and the Vietnam War, because they do not receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful as the kids played and the couples took their hands, while they carried the fresh pine to the tomb lamps.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red bond attached at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, virtually remained silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the ice air.
Some read in a loud voice names sculpted on the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet shade, for those whose sheets have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wrapped the tears of her eyes in front of her son's tomb.
He walked eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Sgt. Navy artiller David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
“Many after my death I want someone to remember it.”
Cuban officials arrest a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile and portable computers in the country, the State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the U.S. Department of Interests in Havana are seeking access to the detained, who was arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an early blogger community, led by popular commenter Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission in several occasions to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The detention of a U.S. contractor may likely cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a “low-rhythm” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to reveal the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity from the U.S. side.
Mobile and portable computers are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year; they are used primarily for text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Department of Interests in Havana, said that most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba is among chains for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and arrest are clearly unfair.
A activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the American program of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, the same Cuba", a reference to the placement of Raul Castro as a leader of the country, to replace his sick brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He manifested that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials dismantle conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a conspiracy to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope that the case could help dismantle an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who browse the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
The researchers said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in the Pakistan tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA complot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Thus, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were regarded as part of a hidden operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from the anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men did not immutate themselves and were even trying to get the appropriate approval to access the al-Qaeda camps when Pakistani police arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, what’s most important, determine who they are trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has put as its primary priority trying to infiltrate people within al-Qaeda.
The organization’s recruitors act as guards, not leaving those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that al-Qaeda analyzes with special attention the aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent an enormous attraction, because of their potential to have access to U.S. goals and because of their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Thousands protest in Copenhagen, calls for ‘climate action’
On Saturday dozens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center to take more bold actions for the climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
In a day in which little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding pancartes in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "The Earth says "ja basta".
Several famous men joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travel to Peru, her mother’s homeland, made me aware of the anguish matters with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal the world leaders, so that they present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
Police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or for carrying pocket knives.
According to the Danish law, those activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists with sports masks and black clothes placed several explosives near the main Copenhagen channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they began as called, but that they were followed by "a pair of large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, chief negotiator of China on climate.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he answered in English, "I was really not aware of the situation."
Then he continued saying in mandarine, "As the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going out."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each one to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the public in general and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, “there can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
Last week’s Federal Qualifications Book on Matematics Performance was a very good news for the Public Schools of the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best-performance systems in the country, the qualification booklet showed that fourth and eighth grade students have been shaking at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent performance difference between African-American students and white students, both at the local and national level.
The average scores of D.C. fourth grade white students during the last two years, increased from 262 to 270 (at a scale of 500), but their African-American pairs increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African Americans of the eighth degree remained essentially fixed, down a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not quite large.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference that separated white and black students of fourth grade in 2003, when the first ENPE in the District was made known, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some educational lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set taking care of those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I’m not giving joy jump for a difference of two or three points, said the D.C. Council member, Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-For accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s management style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city’s secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what’s worried is that we’re not devoting neither the time nor the energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue finding better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students of the higher degrees of primary and secondary school, who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and real life experiences, which was introduced in the District under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, to which it is accredited some of the progress by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to continue to work to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the degree level, Rhee said.
Others say the results of the ENPE highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall system performance and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a kind of scabulous dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to stick to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our barriary schools, so that all families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
We have to reach almost 200 days to have the strength of change, Janey said, who came to an agreement with the syndicate of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers as a "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Make higher education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong breakthrough.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, descended and broke for a moment in front of the white columns, the brick facades and the smaragd prades.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a university campus.
Yet, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the registration costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! here’s where I’m! exclamed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced they had entered the building of sciences.
Caray, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the low proportion of school teachers-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their three-day journey, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you’re going to go to the university.
The question is to which.
Although there is growing concern for the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or get pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduate at the university, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central American, entered the United States without completing secondary school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way to follow for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s labor force.
Those who analyze the highest performance say they often have a natural affinity to school and a innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with U.S. schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to the university, if the efforts are sustained in time.
Observing low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them browse the system, it’s deducted that any intervention at any time won’t solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that financed the tour by the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run university preparation programs, which start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent frequenting the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Petroleum Ministry Agreements with 10 Foreign Petroleum Companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to reconstruct their fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements that the Iraqi Petroleum Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies went away having risen in only two of the 10 underwrapped sites.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who gave an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for subcontracts in June.
The poor representation of the U.S. oil giants at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asian and European at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Petroleum Forum, an online news center.
It will take a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military retires, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from rising more energetically in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases in disadvantage because rivals, Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they don’t respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The main U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have stretched bonds with the Iraqi Petroleum Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have gone away with empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two major buildings.
We know that China is on the way to become a major economic and technological power, oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be alongside its competitors and will comply with its commitments towards Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit proposals made offers that then confronted the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each site.
The main al-Qaeda planner has been murdered in Pakistan.
A alleged U.S. missile attack on the Pakistani-Afghan border is believed to have killed a major al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorist officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who is thought to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the northern Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified plane of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence agency official said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants precipitated to the place and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorist officials cited non-specific evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner, who directed the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspirating around the world, a senior official said, who spoke from anonymity, quoting the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistan's territory.
Considering their central role, this probably included conspiratory attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide from al-Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had rapidly ascended to the al-Qaeda rows and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way decrease the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second al-Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of unmanned aircraft attacks led by the CIA has decreased since summer, from an average of approximately six operations a month to two, according to a report by The Long War Journal, a website led by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, who have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while dishonestly killing suspects, the site said.
UN top ambassador to Kabul to resign
United Nations top ambassador to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign from his position in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was damaged by accusations of corruption spread in the U.N. supported Afghan presidential election.
The departure of Eide occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send about 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN ambassador said he supports the increase, but he is concerned that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule that starts in 18 months will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We have to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghan so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil officials, who collaborate with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he had time to find a replacement.
What I’ve said is that it’s better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously headed UN peace missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and of covering evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said that the accusations of Galbraith, who was dismissed, "surely damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism regarding international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civil representative to coordinate the assistance efforts by the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, who borrow to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed his frustration over the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, claiming that the UN’s heavy recruitment regulations undermined his ability to capture talents.
The UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, because it failed to set up talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, left importance to the perspective of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the probability of such an event.
One thing that weighs me is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent imprevisibility of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He said it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less secure with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the instructions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he said he would again negotiate on the restriction of his nuclear program and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for that agreement, as a way to build confidence between the two parties and make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have gone away from the attempted agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing with the United States.
Frankly, I think that the hardening of Iran with the international community on some proposals they actually accepted in early October, has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set as a deadline December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before re-planning other options, even continuing with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "destroying sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran’s mission before the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday “unfounded and unfounded accusations” by some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue the talks with the United States and other five world powers, “to an appropriate, long-term solution.”
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the oil-rich Iraqi Kurdish region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions continue to rise between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to decrease the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within an unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that sermoned them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby more means a tomb more."
They learned the lesson so well that, when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population of their city, suddenly changed their direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: In no way.
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31 years old, a human resource manager with a 8-month child.
More than 30 years after the policy of a single child was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously rejected children, unique children malcribed, affectuously named "small emperors", a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
The UN demographic, while the number of residents 60 years and older is expected to exploit from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent towards 2050.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with very cult populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to “help to reduce the proportion of the elderly population and mitigate a future workforce shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
Redacted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's policy of a single son is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face enormous fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have advocated the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in imposing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural proportion male-woman.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually shed their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the woman are unique children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hard line lems.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, the posters that ordered the families to have a single child, were replaced by copies of regulations that detailed who would be suitable to have a second child and how to request a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing Answer
Although officials in a rural city outside Shanghai claim that they observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples wanting a second child after the campaign’s launch, the most urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still predicted to reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance that the government provides them.
Without a social protection network, they say, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West erroneously see the policy of single child as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months from the first child of the couple.
We are stolen the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It is the money.
Other couples quote psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resource manager, said he wants a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owner of a translation agency, explained it in a more rigorous way.
For parents with two middle-class races that reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about having enough success as to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents’ struggle during the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from the parents, he said.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, “there’s to remodel your apartment,” and the strategic “there’s to have a curriculum prepared for the best gardens when the child has 9 months.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Our is the first generation with the highest level of life, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
United Nations Group Launches a Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recriminations, captured a renewed attention on Friday with the disclosure of a document that predicts ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations carry on their shoulders the majority of the load in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way to follow.
But it was seen as a major advance in a negotiation that is staying without time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Elaborated by an ad hoc UN work group, the text does not talk about how much money wealthy countries would give to the poor to face the short-term and long-term global warming.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, which include how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the global temperature rise limit that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the UN top climate official, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the great panorama."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared to the 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, on Friday the same class of verbal artificial fires that have dominated conversations last week was presented.
The U.S. Special Climate Envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that demand compulsory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a harder line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the leading developing countries advancing and taking measures, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei stated that the highest U.S. climate negotiator lacked "common sense" or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically facing global recalculation.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s leading powers in play, the fault lines have made eruption both within the world on developing routes, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most brave action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said it is not surprising that major powers are discussing who should cost the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate said, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally mandatory treaty in Copenhagen, although the majority of the main participants say that the talks will ultimately produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Insular States, which has 43 members, prepared a proposal for a 24-page preliminary treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of the small island nations has "make political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now united and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks assumed a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must solve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, descended from the aircraft and ran to the Bella Center corrents, to closed doors meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims that will be arbitrated during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists playing the guitar present night shows burling out of the countries that they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed by hand in hand rather than by mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The heavy weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km/h from Britain redefines that feeling of Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a silbido will perforate the darkness to sign a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed interurb train in the country will reach the 225 kmh, when it passes as a rays from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first interurb Javelin service outside London.
He expects the new service to finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbances of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Disguised apart areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened and the shift of aircraft and cars to the rail would reduce domestic coal emissions, as well as relieve congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds that are needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and the fears about environmental damage, can still stop Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a viability study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line that connects London to the western Midlands will be traced within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 meters of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network that is directed to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favourite option that is being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch that goes west from the Penins to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Only one line would enter Scotland.
“It seems that this will be the most beneficial option,” a railway member said.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first tram, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the slightly more than an hour.
The proposals would allow the trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is designed to support trains of 400 meters of length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the capital’s space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be expanded to adapt to the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if the work is launched, the network should be built in sections.
In the beginning, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines through the existing routes north of Birmingham, keeping the travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a shift from aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for £75,000 orange from a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived “on rations,” increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build a rubber-marked extension in his second house in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who leads a review of the members’ expenses. Tonight Mr. Duncan said that the requests “ couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Parliament members, possesses a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the honorary office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "Orange".
The neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not requested to make any reference on the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee abstained him from violating the rules, after an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of £271,406 from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
The documents spread this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately £1,400 monthly in mortgage interests, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
Mr. Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland's mortgage interest rate did not change at that time, suggesting that all the increase would finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable mortgage type of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the type it is now.
The latest document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a hidden reporter filmed him saying that the MPs had to survive "from reason" after the expenditure scandal.
“Basically this is nationalized, you have to live by rations and be treated as m**rda.”
He said, “I spend my money in my garden and I ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t do it.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as a petroleum trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before he agreed with the salary office that this “will be considered excessive.”
A activist caught a hole in the shape of the sterling pound in Mr. Duncan’s grass as a protest, after revealing that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: “It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and subsequently by Legg.”
He added: “It is not about eluding and delinquering or infringing the rules or whatever it is.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the Brighton Beach Advent Calendar
Brighton palapes have found a new boost for the winter months in an interactive Event calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapes for every December day, using villanciques as their theme.
The event began on 1 December, with guests who could see the last palace from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled cakes and ponch served for free.
The villancicos chosen so far include Vi Three Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is a unpaid clergy of the Chichester Diocese and the leader of Beyond.
He said, “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
“Why do we expect as a Church that people come to a strange old building?I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the Advent Calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to try and represent it through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in demand for an ambitious and binding deal to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, parade through the Danish ice capital in claim of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach at the latest on Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen to be very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke apparatus with socks and martyrs, a journalist told AFP.
The Anti-Disturbs Police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to it, it is especially of members of the “Black Blocks”, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April last.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night married and sitting despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped at about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a vigil with candles.
The majority of the protesters arrived by bus and train from the major European cities, but numerous Asian citizens, including Chinese and Korean, were present as well as some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, the majority with heavenly rabbits, responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue mares" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, water courses through which you can walk as never before you could have done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached ecologist organizations.
French MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the struggle against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world."
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial peak to wings demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, parade red-dressed and glowing pants with lems in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters formed concentrations claiming to act energetically against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abjasia elected president, although Georgia denounces 'fraud'
On Saturday, Abjasia, the Prussian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Around 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Osetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first preliminary results will be announced on Saturday to Sunday night.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disrupted the voting scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili, on his side, "commons that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia tries to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhumi, a beautiful white building with palm on the entrance.
The topic of Russian domination is the central topic of the presidential election in this region with sublime landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Big tables show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, welcomed warmly the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank the support of Moscow, and very, the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as one that covers Russia the control of the shut down railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
You need a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be held two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, in warning, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
About 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, parade in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, fairly peaceful, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are underway.
The protesters stopped at approximately 500 meters from the centre, without trying to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a vigil with candles.
A few minutes after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke apparatus with bricks and martyrs, a AFP journalist.
The antidisturbs police surrounded them quickly and firmly intervened, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people precising that it was mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April last.
At the last hour of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the mandibula with a slurry, and four cars were burned near an occupied house during the incidents that led to arresting about twenty people, the police said.
The extremist groups have not taken their eyes from above, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said, while the helicopters of the order forces flown over the area.
The majority of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, and even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asian people, including Chinese and Korean, were present as well as some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, the majority with heavenly rabbits, responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue mares" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine militant of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the struggle against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world."
Oxfam, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who had to head the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, among them, the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial peak to wings demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and bright pants with lems in favor of solar energy in front of the city city of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, there were hundreds of protesters who claimed to act against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography comes strengthened from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be transmitted in the Sunday Informative (JDD, according to his French sigle) that history and geography would be "fortified" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from the mandatory teaching in the second year of scientific bachelor's degree.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor's will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "but with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it calls the best students."
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be substrates of the C, it continues to emphasize even: "I didn't even hear that historians or intellectuals were indignated by having removed history and geography in second of bachelor's degree in technological schools."
A IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven Frenchmen of ten (69%) disappointed the government's project to eliminate the mandatory teaching of history-geography in second of bachelor's C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives of the right also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" about eliminating philosophy from the secondary bachelor's C program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will be aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also do practices in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practices.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose “the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education.”
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the climate evolution.
Five minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that was accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Higher Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the "Ernest" conference round, a day composed of a series of 15-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, a journalist told AFP.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and transmit to them the desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school’s pond.
We chose about twenty participants among the experts of their discipline and selected them by their charismatic side.
About global warming, "we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It’s part of our scientific role, he said, hoping that the public understands that “the Copenhagen Conference is based on a highly serious scientific file.”
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website from December 15.
For February the next day "Ernest" is scheduled, followed by others at a bimestral pace.
Payment Delay: Disagreement Between Prison Guards, Actions Are Planned
The prison guards syndicates called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand the payment before the end of the year holidays, the primes and the extra hours, which was delayed up to energy budgetary reasons.
The Penitenciary Workers' Force (the 2nd Guard Syndicate) asked the out-of-service staff to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to denounce the theft of their possessions.
The CGT penitenciary (3th trade union of the profession) calls for them to "reunite in general assemblies in the different prisons to a mass mobilization", since it tells of "shameful and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December of the "extra hours, primes night, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guardians syndicate, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), “calls to general mobilization (...) in order to increase dissatisfaction and anger.”
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours increased much in 2009 and not all were accounted, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor said that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guardians’ syndicates guaranteeing them that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our penitentiary system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures intended for this situation generated by a bad assessment of the number of extra hours not to occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for the staff of the management who enjoys the benefit of the famous primes for functions and objectives, and who “always blame the budget requirements,” the Ufap/Unsa regretted.
It’s a real scandal, said angry the interregional FO union of Marsella, announcing its decision to boycott up to a new order “all meetings and calls”.
The staff will not come to work the corresponding Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with the extra hours, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At the time we increase the tasks and missions without taking more effective, it is more than unfortunate to dare to attack the salary of the staff, the Burdeos Penitentiary CGT estimates.
According to the trade unions, not in all regions happens the same, since some have more luck than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, said UFP Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those he receives
President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television presentator Oprah Winfrey that he came to a simple conclusion regarding the gifts: "I make better gifts than those I receive."
During a special interview that the ABC channel will broadcast on Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle explain how they think to celebrate the end of year holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s four-foot little companion, will be of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarificing that the dog will receive a "sigurely" gift, according to the program extract transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreeed with her husband’s statements about the quality of the gifts she receives: “In no way, last year I made you beautiful gifts,” she said provoking the president.
It is true, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor pointing to the First Lady's pear collar: "Who gave you that?"
During an hour interview, in an atmosphere distended with the famous animator who devotionally supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us on Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
On her side, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I didn’t know how to arrange a house, then I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL says he is in coma induced
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to important "lesions" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his neighbors, while RTL says the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "lesions derived from the operation" of disc hernia held in Paris on November 26, said his press service in that same city, indicating that said lesions "need a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to transmit tranquility stating that the situation was "under control", and that a new medical part would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "sickness and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about his state, adds RTL.
The press service, interrogated by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also says that "according to some sources" it would not have been introduced any canyon after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the hospital Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's intimate friend, said on Thursday on RTL that his friend travelled "a bad moment", but said he didn't make "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a fool to get twelve hours flying after such an operation, it’s not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the producer of the musician, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to calm by stating that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactoryly to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controled".
Camus said he talked with Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated from a "column cancer", after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is exaggerated. fans and journalists noticed the musician's difficulties to move on stage.
In mid-November, his neighbors had even to deny a new internship.
Euro-2009/short swimming pool: first Bousquet title in its favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup of Long Swimming Pool, won a international title on a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in Short Swimming Pool in Istanbul on Thursday.
In the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were overcome when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in 4 x 50 m 4 styles (man).
A pen for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand that possesses in long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two distances Queen of Swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was imposed with 20''53 during a final where they competed ten swimmers instead of eight as usual, an international premiere.
Bousquet advanced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always pursue something better and, in that case, I’ve already said that if the world record was at my reach, I’d try to it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wearing polyurethane swimmers from January 1st will be prohibited.
These bathers, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epopeya in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the bathers didn’t help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long swimming this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to drop his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he imposed himself with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I did not give up in this career.
I knew that this time I would not be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: a sarcophage panel belonging to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, much above the estimated price, Sotheby's art marketer announced.
This panel of 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century after Christ, and its price was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionisiac scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by saithers and Jewish women, is an unusual piece, since in the world there are only four or five," said Florent Heintz, vice president of exhibitions of art of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest paid by buyers, without a doubt, a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel formed part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathroom in her particular Paris mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Mariscal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his parade was uncertain.
Revising the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel formed part of an Emile Zola succession opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to transfer to its territory to the defeated president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the golpist government denied the salvocondut.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to get to Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, a source from the General Directorate of Migration said.
In order to grant him a salvoconduct, the golpist government wanted to force Zelaya to "renunciate" and to ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as head of state in guest exercise.
The golpist government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign (...), they wanted me to submit my resignation," Zelaya said on Thursday to Radio Globo, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some accords the Deputy President, refugees at the Embassy of Brazil in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico submitted us a request for a rescue, but unfortunately we couldn't accept it because it didn't contain an asylum request, the Minister of the Interior of the golpist government, Oscar Raúl Matute, said on Wednesday to the Honduran radio HRN.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as the president of the Honduran people, he said.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the Deputy President, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, strongly seized by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the government’s position.
This reflects the marginal character of this government in front of international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chávez, was defeated on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and refused to the embassy of Brazil.
If he goes, he will be arrested and must respond to the Justice for the crime of "high betrayal", according to the golpist government.
De facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries of Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until its term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, the figures of the U.S. trade balance are faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7,13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We receive good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-filled glass."
For Peter Cardillo, Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on the figures of the U.S. trade balance, “which reflect an improvement in the activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October, compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected, on the contrary, a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great novelty is the growth of the volumes of trade exchanges, in particular, the exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, the unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the course of the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest since a year ago," said Scott Marcouiller, from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bonus yield rose to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bonus yielded to 4,492% against 4,408% on evening.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of Abuchean power to the "Damas de Blanco"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban supporters abduced the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were called.
About 40 "Damas de Blanco", wives or family members of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by Raul Castro's government supporters while walking to the center of the capital claiming the release of those detained, a AFP journalist said.
The Yankees are dying!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raul!", the militants of the power headed up to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil-dressed agents who came to “protect them.”
On the eve, a similar demonstration took place against the "Dames of White" in Havana, without wounds or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also hoping to demonstrate on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights, were arrested by police officers dressed in civil, a AFP journalist.
The agents raised by force to the vehicles to the dissidents who were shaken by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Dames of White", awarded with the 2005 Sajarov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "solve the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissidence, said one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, purges a penalty of 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 remain behind the reyes.
Cuban authorities tile opponents of “mercenaries” or “agents” at the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely made in the media, Cuban television about the Thursday protest of the government militants against the “contrarevolutionary.”
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of puzzling rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A rabbit kills a octogenary with a knife and leaves five injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An imbalanced man with two knives killed a 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday afternoon at the time of greatest affluence.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor, would have hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly, in the pharmacy or in front of this in No. 85 of the bulevar Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police officer Alliance.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of this, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with his partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, was arrested and wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the elderly died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a dismay and was interned "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the bulevar Jean Jaurès.
Apparently by chance, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one man of thirty years old, and another of forty seriously.
The scene of the crime was still unclear.
He was armed with two carnivorous knives that he carried crossed on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Alliance Syndicate at the Altos del Sena.
Several passengers, including young people, tried to control the kidnapped, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn’t do it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a nearby bar staff.
A crowd was thrown over him, among them a police officer who broke the doll, he added.
By the bulevar Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, among them the head, attempted to arrest the armed man and were wounded at knights, according to the police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous stores are found.
Some people came to tell me that there was a man wounded on the street.
When I put him in a safe position, I perceived a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, approximately 35 years old, with knife wounds arrived.
Police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
He was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his detention he did not say a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of internship in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to master him in Clichy's commissariat where he was transferred.
He was “in a state of over-excitation” as “every disorder of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action.”
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again claimed on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of "The Pianist", denounced before three judges of the California Second District Appeal Chamber serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel declared: I call that at this same time the charges are dismissed, since the judge’s behavior at that time, Laurence Rittenband, “resulted scallowing.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (dead since then) would have talked with a prosecutor who would have commented that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before dictating a sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary “Roman Polanski: wanted and desired” (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), of the prosecutor David Wells’ own mouth.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September that he "has lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the conclusion of a trial that would allow him to submit the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the disappointment of the case.
The accusation, on its part, reiterated the argument exposed in first instance, i.e., that no desestimation of the charges could be seriously evaluated as long as Roman Polanski had not presented himself before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was dictated for "illegal sexual relationships" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never gone back to the United States.
The Los Angeles district vice-fiscal, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be here to present himself in the audience."
With this cause, we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is the possibility of fleeing?, asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "seek a favor to the court, although he dishonors his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his judgment, also highlighted that "there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He claims that his client is no longer able to be accused every time the Polanski case arises, and adds: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Twenty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland for order of U.S. arrest.
After more than two months after the raids, he was sentenced to house imprisonment in his cabin in Gstaad, waiting for an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses direction and brakes by the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday, in a market that is debated between better indicators than the forecast in the U.S. and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won a 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost a 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of technological component, lost 0.55 points to sit at 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend wasined thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which “help to improve the market opinion as to the solidity of economic reactivation,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and greater than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of U.S. consumers visibly recovered in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimates of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices stopped by a new dollar advance that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, "which leads to the decline of the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
In this way, the technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury bonus yield rose to 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bonus yielded to 4,497% against 4,492% on evening.
Miss World elections again in South Africa
After a month of tour in South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are in the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real revolt.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences! said surprising Miss Sierra Leone.
This contest, which will be held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17h (15h GMT).
I can’t imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very glad to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of re-covering "African landscapes that take the breath."
After a month of gallas, trials, press wheels and safaris, the Miss World candidates focus on the contest.
India Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional clothes and, of course, with a bathroom.
Chinese presentator Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has shown to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, chairman of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who stretched their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the 2010 June World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event even more.
I met people I never thought to get to know.
She probably returns to the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going out very well, David Hallyday told the press when he dropped from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after the local 13h (21h GMT).
The son of the singer, distended, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection derived from the disc hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, a sequence of a disc hernia operation on November 26 last in Paris.
The singer was operated again the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries produced by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attended, to witness a school event, a photographer from the AFP confirmed.
Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be alongside the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26 at the international private clinic of the Monceau Park, in Paris.
They said it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were angry, Camus said.
We are talking about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had " traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Paris surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and I was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem doing the trip, because I was operated twice with disc hernia, he added.
Shortly earlier on the broadcaster RTL, he indicated that the singer seemed to have "goed without canula, without anything," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed by a brain bleeding.
It’s a poor reputation doctor, condemned by justice on several occasions for malapraxis, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being “a man without scruples” demanded “with regularity” before the Council of the Order, and is “looks from being recommendable.”
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was performed without any inconvenience" and that the results of postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation " couldn't provoke bleeding and therefore didn't need drainage," he added.
In any way, the singer's tour, whose health problems multiply since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, regaining the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems to me very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its sigla
The association UDF (Unión para la Democracia Francesa), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday before the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the sequel of the former Giscardist party, intimidating him to withdraw her from all support, so sad to be demanded.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political inheritance after having stretched his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Defense Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As a support for his management, he received the help of Deputy Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who claims the property of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who don’t want to be deprived of this, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the Deputy intimidating them to renounce the sigla and to transfer to them the property rights of the brand, so penalty of judicial claim.
These last days, you have made many statements insinuing that you are going to propose your political movement to recover the UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site.
As they already know, they have no right to use the slogan, the UDF office explains that it demands that the NC "immediately remove the name of the UDF from all supports, as well as from (their) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) brand to the legitimate rightholders."
If not, it will appeal to justice to make respect for the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and remind that Morin and his friends "were" going in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Centre has, according to them, no right to use the UDF signs.
They also remember that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand," he was no longer "a member of the UDF since three years ago", but of the UMP.
Use scandalous and fraudulently the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to do it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before laughing on the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for weakness abuse
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to submit to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter says, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenary to expel her from a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of the show's stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter struggle the regions of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, to be subject to a medical examination in charge of three medical professionals.
The inheritance and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to submit such exams, even more in the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which they will have to make it clear whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered weakness states and during what periods.
I think he will accept.
I’m going to talk to her, said Mr. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, when he left the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The peritage will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
Since two years ago, Liliane's single daughter Bettencourt has initiated criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifacetic artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to get a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or art works.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the origin of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' allegations resulted, in some occasions, a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane's lawyer Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said he doubted Françoise's husband Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
“Since his wedding, I could never talk to Françoise again.”
On its part, the Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was not able to compare, as much as a tutel judge refused, in these last days, to make place to her request to open a judicial tutelage procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under custody and has no tutor.
No other person will be able to appear in his place,” said public ministry representative Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would be made once the judgment was made.
Management Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employers reminds the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about that collaborators adhere to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the market conquest strategies... although the authority temptation to impose products that are not related to the customer’s preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a mortal desmoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the peak of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) “ requires that all stakeholders [...] have a proactive behavior and a prospective vision”; this requires from the employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authority management.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist in putting the collaborators at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative benefit.
Will internal opinion surveys, such as the Orange questionnaire among its employees, encourage the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I am afraid not.
-In principle, because I could verify that, facing a new situation, and after many rounds, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authority, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Lastly, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the major engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the ancient conductist theory that American "neurosciences" reactivated recently, and that the Studies and the media spread widely behind them.
In this way, suggesting that it is possible to handle the “commands” (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent Ipsos research published on Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanicist management posture, unadapted to the world of today.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating in every reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employees’ motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined dox that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, corporate managers can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and re-locate the management of human waste “on the place”.
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: For the 'fair war' Obama receives praises from the right
On Friday, the US right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "fair war" against the US enemies, acclaimed the speech Obama had spoken on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had disacredited the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Ms. Palin, the head figure of the Republican party's right wing to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she had addressed the topic of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the appeal to force, a way to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For moments, the speech seemed to me very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, which some consider as a possible candidate for the Republican investidura for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to listen to "a left-wing president" when he reminded the members of the Nobel Committee "that they't be free nor could deliver a peace prize if the force recourse did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current Washington Post chronist, Obama spoke "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as “the citizen of the world,” as “he always does,” “he spoke like a U.S. president” by reminding the Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few of the right not very convinced, a falcon of the Bush era, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the Internet site National Review Online.
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the appeal to force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Time, although he still believes Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "must serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the californian newspaper commented enthusiastically.
Obama "run the speech that was necessary," the New York Times estimated, judging it "at the same time dark and edifying."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patronal organization that remained until the final, arrived on Friday afternoon to an agreement that puts an end to the strike consigna and the threat that rejects on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the state secretary of transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" with the deal, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators dismissed at Friday’s evening with the hope to quickly sign the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three patronal organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a portfolio.
But a more than six-hour meeting that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 18 a.m.
The conflict "will have been very harmful to" and "there was fear that it would disturb the holidays of the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text predicts a 4% increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hour rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not a lot, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there are no more cuts or blocks in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disconform rebels, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, recognized that it was “a good agreement,” although it was “difficile to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition.”
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement."
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is “a acceptable commitment.”
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in shipping costs and the celebration of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow primarily to address the issue of an extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a drop of 100 million euros in the patronal charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification bill that the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The TLF signature allows the agreement to be applied, in the first place, to the companies affiliated with this organization and, in the second place, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "with the shortest time," Bussereau said.
The opposition of employer organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "negative deal", since the 100 million euros "have already been promised to the sector to compensate part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretary of State for Transports forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who want to eat pavo in the next Nightmare dinner, Unostra regretted.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts “the stability of a lot of SMEs in the sector at risk over the next 12 months.”
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, trade unions disconform with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on the RER A, the largest urban public transportation line in France, will continue during the weekend, because on Friday's meeting, 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the direction of the RATP, there was no agreement and the trade unions remained unhappy with regard to their demand for premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10h and 20h, due to a train of each two on the central tram (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of each four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change the train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which awaits 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced that “RATP strives to provide service to the big stores.”
The RER crosses from west to east the city of Paris.
The RATP tram runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one of every two trains circulated in point hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at the eve, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "a hour and a half earlier to get to time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned the supervision of police and order forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with its destination arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of workers in strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday.The results will be analyzed, "low satisfactory" according to the trade unions, of a meeting that was held with the direction on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers want to claim a premium that is due to them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP puts even among parentheses its prime proposals, the CGT said indignated, pointing out that the direction "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a broader analysis on the conditions of the profession's exercise," the RATP said.
This also led the trade unions to say that the company "does not care about the users of the weekend."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to the RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had submitted a warning.
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independants) and complain of the degradation of the working conditions on this line that has a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of primes, for alternate rounds, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country’s main prokurd party, a decision that immediately caused anger demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the government’s task, which has just stretched a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that damaged the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party leaders, among which are his president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are apart from political life for five years.
Also, the judge announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity of which Turk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party’s property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (from 550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that the MPs would leave the Parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision arises as a result of a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political apparatus of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s judgment comes at the time the government stretches a hand to the Kurdish community and proposes a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders said a dissolution could generate a recruiting of tensions in the Southeast Anatoly, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan, degenerated in confrontations with police over the past weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP locals in Diyarbakir, the south-eastern great care, mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear granates and used water canons, while the protesters threw Molotov bombs or stones with hints.
In Istanbul, approximately a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Turk said that the decision of the justice would “extend the disappointment.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we are opposed to the closure of parties.
So nothing is resolved, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotted the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK adjudicated an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
The snowfall could start suddenly.
A truly fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It’s absolutely something that wants to make life impossible to citizens, says the road maintenance director in the winter of the FES
But with this their employees can learn to try and master the entire vehicle technology.
Weather scientists may announce this for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as snow profoundly in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A trams come out with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the body of firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and stairs with pendants, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins around 3 a.m.
They must be covered approximately 1,040 kilometers, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheses better.
That’s why the FES starts around 3 p.m., “with this the roads are free until the traffic of the hour points begins.”
The difficult thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30.
“Then we have a problem,” says the road maintenance director in winter, “because then no one is ready to clean space to the vehicles with salt.”
Immediately after, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belongs to the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The latter priority is the side and secondary streets.
This is where the discomfort is generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around 5 a.m. the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and crossroads are cleared.
In general, the FES could not take care of the entire roads for bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly to the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become scratched quickly, the salt vehicle starts as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Count of the Dinosaur
The Tawa hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre long and 1.50-metre high animal running over the two strong backs, had an extended head with sharp teeth and curved, short arms with hoz-shaped garras and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of millions of years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the Ecuador.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogy relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we’ve found in a day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for triastic sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the team of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
During the excavation, the remains of five specimens were gathered in total.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional discovery: "Triasic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current opinion, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, about when the saurios divided into their three most important genealogy lines: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia herbívoros (saurios with bird pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the crane of Tawa, the researchers found indications of air bags, such as those that also own the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also the bones of the spine were obviously partially full of air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive airbags theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the emparent line of the subsequent giant sauropods also owned light air bags and bones, the common ancestors of both groups were likely to already produce this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians arose there for the first time.
Consequently, the three genealogical lines separated at the beginning and spread from South America through all corners of the Earth, which then still formed a unique earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa finds the remains of two other theropods not very intimate.
The three cannot descend from a single parent ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migration waves have been given to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
There are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn’s paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is barely something to discover.
The question of how the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare side line of the reptiles to the dominant Earth vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triasic the dinosaurs still shared their life space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current cocodrils and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
At the end of the Triasic the dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while the relatives extincted at the border of the Triasic to the Jurassic.
Successful stories were not eternal.
There are two possibilities to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have been given a mass extinction to which dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so these could overcome the counterparts in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteor impact stopped the rise of a group of species, which had already evolved in the Triasic and since then had a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police displacement of the occupied casino at the Goethe University in Frankfurt impacted around the world.
278 professors and teachers from the Goethe University, although also from higher education centers throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with the students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they “reject” the police displacement promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, left the building occupied by students and teachers in educational strike last week because the walls and artworks were covered by propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify “the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and teachers by a police command.”
The departure represented a “unacceptable attack” on the freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served for “the illegitimation and criminalization of the protest” and distorted the attention of the content.
The board has refused to set up the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the court complaint.
The majority of the occupants did not cause any material damage, it is said.
Legitimated Protests
Also the youth of the Verdi syndicate and the German Federation of Trade Unions are solidarizing with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and police.
We are grateful to the University Director.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, Aktuelle Stunde said on Thursday at the parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are understandable with the protest, but we are not understandable with vandalism, said Peter Beuth, the provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Green and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of students, they are distracted.
The Left has submitted a motion, in which it requires the Minister of the Interior to present a report on the police intervention.
The Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strongly custodied site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the Riedberg Scientific Headquarters in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of Strong Collaboration".
Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research center of natural sciences will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado.
Scientific exchanges
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
It also focuses on trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortiums Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forest mountains, in which research facilities were settled.
Bridges of Stuttgart
The Dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not placed high enough for anything.
For the supporters of the project it’s simple and flatly about “the new heart of Europe”.
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rivers, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the nineteenth century, which acted as brakes of a modern rail traffic, since formerly a huge amount of time was needed to engage the locomotives backward forward.
Root, stop in dry continue the journey; but so must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passage station, which is approximately half the route of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; therefore the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be initiated, although the 80-year-old visions are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hesse and Bavarian capitals it is almost impagable to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals, of course, do not have more input and output problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car on both sides.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE-built tram to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have said that.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are carried by the taxpayer and not the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
A new urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably graphics generated by the designer’s computer.
For the railway transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But the modern transportation policy should first engage in strengthening goods transport, since rail transport is considerably more ecological than that carried out on the roads.
However, the new stairs in construction are good for us for cargo trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more seriously, the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than 6 billion euros should be buried in the Zawos.
This is the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is sure that in the next decade the money will be missing in other crosses and narrow passages on the network.
In total, 60 major projects are on the Ministry of Transport list.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rivers through the Rhin valley.
Since 1987 the trail is being built slowly.
It would be urgent here to step the accelerator as it is right.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The threshold of the Rhin valley will be the bottle neck for international goods transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves pendent in the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden, if it will file an appeal against the decision on the ban of night flights of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have commissioned experts the legal investigation of the VGH judgment, of more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had founded in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest landing track at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to regulate again the ban of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as the federal government predicts, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population of noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4th, whether it will file the appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pushed government representatives to resign from the appeal before the National Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of night air traffic prohibition, which they had made before the elections.
It’s quite difficult, if one let him fulfill his word, Greens head Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s slogan “We fulfill our word.”
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, which the federal government would be attempting by means of deprivation of the right and tricks yet to obtain their night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally intact decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been the claims of its group about the ban of night air traffic.
The U.S. banks refund the borrowed aid.
The big U.S. banks shocked by the crisis are removing their state bonds.
The Bank of America returned once the aid that the Tarp bank rescue fund had borrowed to him of a total of 45,000 million (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report from the U.S. CNBC.
With this institutes intend to get rid of the restrictions that had gone out of hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of the bonuses to the directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had achieved approximately 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of rubles.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked on Wednesday night especially the U.S. taxpayers: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult moments.
The bank house had wrongly calculated the effort of the investment bank’s absorption in the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also seeks to get money on the capital market to be able to get rid of its obligations against the state.
The CNBC from a well-known circle source that the U.S. bank could announce that its capital will increase by $20 billion for Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to make comments.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Fast elections
At the end, everything was faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressed the chief editorial Nikolaus Brender to leave his position, the channel can present a successor.
Last night, the parliament intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially to not anticipate the procedure.
But it also influenced not to hurt the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the closure of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed in the board with his proposal to renew for another five years more the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's withdrawal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the head of writing had been organized by Hesse's government president, Mr. Roland Koch.
He concluded another mandate of the prestigious chief of writing with the argument, that under Brender's direction the ZDF's informatives would have lost audition indices.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which the political influence on the ZDF flagged.
At the end of the debate, 35 public law specialists qualified Koch’s proceedings as unconstitutional.
But it served nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Politics, Pedagogy and Romanic Philology.
He then worked on the broadcaster "Südwestfunk" and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 staff spokesman of the head of writing; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and driver of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the ZDF's foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF's study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional claim after Brender's dismissal, which was elected as the journalist of the year on Wednesday by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the president of the government of Renania-Palatinado, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the proposals of the director's staff cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of supportive politicians from the ZDF control grams was discarded by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself before the administrative council with a smart gameplay: he strongly criticized the grammy for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him for the post of head of writing without losing the face, as the administrative council was able to vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving him the post to a party sequence.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is allocated to the left-wing liberals.
The university courses are shut down
Part success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally ceded. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the cases of bachelor's and master's degree.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the load of exams: Basically each course module must be completed with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the student’s workload, and it is intended to guarantee a “real and justifiable measure.”
Politics and universities want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making more flexible structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
The regulations of the federal states that differ from this, should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and rectors of universities are continuously talking about the improvement of being able to perform and successfully conclude a career (studyability).
This is the first time we have spoken about a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Every module ends with a single exam," it is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the “sensitive reduction of the load of exams” it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would sensitively affect studyability, so explained the director of the accreditation council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future the "studibility" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be examined exhaustive as regards unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of...
The courses.
Students would have “the right to get more spaces, which enable and foster their own initiative.”
These rules would apply for new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These should be "reaccredited" again every five years. but this would mean, that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all the careers.
The responsible for this would be at the level of the country 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federal states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states the universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to adopt such measures.
Until now only Renania-Platinada has assured providing additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money the universities should implement tutorials and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen exams offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to provide 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010 the government wants to bring to the parliament a novel of the university law.
According to her, only one exam should be enough for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition, it is intended to guarantee the recognition of evaluations at other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
By the end of the next year it is intended to examine all the careers about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Besides the praise, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the board of directors at the federal level of the university groups Juso (socialist youth) required, that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be carried out "after closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as main involved should be able to think too.
The University Rectors Board (HRK) chairman, Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to students: “We need the students’ experience,” she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK decided on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Syndicate (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the Syndicate requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor's degree the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure, that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in a future sufficient study places for Master with the best possible study conditions.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Enter and leave Germany is practically uncontrolled," says the first line of a lyric Werner Söllner poem in imbalancing idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable lessons or poetry talks in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literary forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he had to talk quite a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the defigurated mirror of his Securitate expeditions"
Visibly insecure and shameful, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted the participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of colleagues German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present in the year 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“So I’m someone who didn’t defend himself sufficiently in the face of Securitate’s fear provocation attempts,” Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time with the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and her literary controversy unlike the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors originating from Romania is shaken by a case that evidences the abyss and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as it is known so far, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his Securitate IM file Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and recalled the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had apologized or defended him at all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this affirmation,” he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of an ex-disident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable shelter for Securitate-Spitzel spies, Herta Müller wrote in July in the weekly Zeit after reading her own 914-page file.
The involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also of Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the Securitate files of control is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national Securitate Explanation Council (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the Explanations since then is given rather to traces.
Since 2005, there has been a law that regulates the administration of the records.
A interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large.
“She has a psychosis,” she was questioned only once.
The infamia of power seemed to be able to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent guilt.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession leaves hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the anxieties of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and by shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize in Literature, is more than a simple note to the foot.
Champions League as a guarnion to fill your stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, approached a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outside service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sporting product manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man of the characteristic calva had hired a driver, because he still didn’t know the city.
On the other hand, he could have also been able to drive the car himself: at the end, there was no alcohol in play, and the 55-year-old man was not even joyful.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or would start for the first time.
In Switzerland's words, which had been hired just three days before: "It's true that we reach the eighth final," i.e., in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, "but we can't let ourselves blind for success: we'll have to struggle brutally against the descent."
The "more important task" was expected for them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the “real classes” in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
by Sorteo
The eighth final of the Champions League (end matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/end matches on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy remained limited by the fulmining entry of the successor of Babbel.
Not only in the supposed savior, which in short time had inspired the disturbed Stuttgart professionals confidence in themselves, willingness to deliver and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, the soul repairer Gross explained his recipe of success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer come out effect.
He deployed a certain magic, Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, accepted, "When a new impulses arise in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a few weeks break due to a injury advanced immediately to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “fenomen” perceived with the proverbial “fresh wind” and the way of working the new boss: “He is a man who intervenes deeply, and requires discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
And that’s what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constance.
Like Gross, the players and administrator also refused to overvalu the triumph against a defense weakened by lack of releases and completely overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 the sad awakening had arrived, he thought Khedira.
And director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his headquarters since three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which again updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that do others, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's hard criticism.
He had reproached leadership weakness to the board, who had decided to change coach by the pressure of teen fanatics.
Also that his free day had been eliminated after the games, Lehmann described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the wrath.
They will probably no longer be friends forever, the two quarentons.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the previous efforts with the replaced coach's team, the show of great play and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “an important participation in success,” said Heldt and Lehmann to the unison; and the man of the plastic suitcase also agreed.
World Heavy Weight Championship
Burning duel in Bern: again and again the reiter Kevin Johnsonn was provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy-weight title in the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains the world champion of heavy weight.
The 38-year-old winner in the WBC association version defeated on Friday to Saturday night in Bern the American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to make the breakdown that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional battles, twice had to be defeated due to his injuries.
Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his struggle number 24.
In front of about 17,000 spectators at the Arena of Bern, Klitschko, with a size of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the struggle above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was escaping again and again of the world champion's strikes, so Klitschko couldn't decisively bring to his target his dangerous right.
In general, the passive Johnson did too little for a retailer, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his strikes only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who held twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the retador had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a “horrible zombie,” who “can’t do anything.”
In doing the weight, the champion left himself provoking on Friday to remove Johnson’s sun glasses from his nose “to be able to see his eyes.”
Fourth triumph after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth struggle after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained unbeatable.
After a break of almost four years, he then defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his "belt" from the WBC, which before had to deliver without fighting.
That year he then won in his defences of the title to Juan Carlos Gómez, of Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola, of the United States.
In this battle I only got a blow, and I’m in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all the four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after this destroyed in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the struggle against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium, London.
The Kunduz case
Opposition's front attack: the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Defense Minister, Gutenberg, liar because of false information about the Kunduz matter.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation to the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has reproached the Defense Minister, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), to have deceived with knowledge of cause.
In Saturday’s news broadcast “Tagesschau”, broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister “knowly did not say the truth” about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The murder order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been announced that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commandant of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, killed or wounded up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the Afghan federal government’s policy, and whether the chancellor, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and her green counterpart Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor has not exercised any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry’s presentation on the reasons for the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden delicate details to the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials transcended that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was at the command, and a report of a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter to clarify the matter, the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports.
He has not received any response until now, he said.
The ministry did not manifest on Saturday regarding the reproaches that are made to him, and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament investigation committee, which will be formed next Wednesday.
The Oniric Worlds
In vigilance, some people see images and hear voices that others don’t see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental sick and drug addicts the boundaries between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we’re lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can deliver ourselves without trouble to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during vigilance, or sees and hears things that others don’t see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world as crazy or narcissist, or at least as mania.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mental sick or drug addicts.
Our imagination is guilty: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality disappear.
Onirically modified warning states can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of the cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the state of chamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations can be removed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or deliries arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been disrupted and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrene psychosis very often complex hallucinations and cracked thoughts appear.
The gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of vigilance, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, constituted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with the onyric states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disappropriates, allocated formations, and mirrors of this."
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colored.
The gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a blow.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mice like blood, deformed, reaching the teeth.
They are pursuing him, they throw him with heavy and flamming shoes, they throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Strict and malignant voices sound from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. releases two cables from the stereo, binding them to form a dirt node, and fixing them on a hole on the roof.
It climbs into a pot and puts the naked around the neck.
and jump.
The corner goes away.
What a lesson to you! cry the voices in a chorus that the timpans reverse, “Go to the clinic and let them cure you!”
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause was the LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
She has learned to live with her illness and has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population fall sick at least once in life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrene psychosis, most of the times the affected people can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inner world, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, deliries of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Specifically extended is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also frequent.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain is no longer able to filter the disturbing signs, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the compounds to a turning of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Heidelberg University Hospital General Psychiatry Clinic.
The schizophrene is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot organize them actively.
This is why schizophrenians often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Contrary to that in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in the psychosis remain in principle as it is.”
Paranoic thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers, it is still unknown why our brain makes cabrioles.
According to Fuchs, exceptional states can lead anyone to losing contact with reality temporarily.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
The researchers suggest that the affected people suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that brain neuronal maturity is affected in a early stage of development, such as through a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is not manifested at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the detonants of a psychosis when there is already a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system of the brain.
When the brain is hot
The illogical of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has collected for ten years reports on hallucinations and visions and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality limit disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and craneoencephalic trauma.
Surprisingly and in certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are poorly cohibited; when our brain is heated, but also when stimuli are missing.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, pain of love or other brain states of exception.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, minst einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and went to a secondary school.
A ordinary girl.
If not for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, it happens that a torpedo boy with long and dark hair addresses his word.
When she responds, the other students look at her suddenly; no one, except her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She is awake and sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bank next.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It’s a pleasant feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you’re crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you are in class sometimes you can’t follow the lesson because the teacher – to his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest explains in a visible and hearing way the mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, he doesn’t know how to distinguish whether he’s awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the mice or the girl with bloody cuts on the arms and legs, appear in front of his open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, he screams to the figures.
To his parents and friends he has not told them anything, they would think he’s crazy.
August 2009 Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She approved selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since he has come into contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, he knows he’s not crazy.
Madness is also an artwork by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulation restriction, it is very likely that after some time he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and it is responsible for looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., a single daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has used the reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise, those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they look so real.”
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not differentiated in the fundamental of those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as irrealistic.
Kasten recommends that their patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
The border between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Heidelberg professor and doctor head of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it was a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differentiate from being awake.
Onyric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or a disease, such as in patients with polirradiculoneuropathy, who experience a motor paralysis being completely conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or the world due to a total and permanent motor incapacity, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with a own and imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A form of situation boundary between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in imagination.
An intense way of giving sense and interpretation to an inappropriate situation in itself that our own creation capacity allows us not to dive into the nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory.
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, also describes his onirical experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of salvation of the soul.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness embarked on several days of travel after a heart valve surgery with heart transplant included, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen drowned into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself postged in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium in a train, a robot watched for his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his country of origin, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with firm snow and met with a Korean mafia.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these indoor trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describes your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
More clear and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
A experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
by burda
The children will be in charge of the editorial at the age of 27.
The new editor Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, SPIEGEL commented.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69 years old, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if you are trained for this.
One cannot put before 7,500 workers his children, if they are not sufficiently trained for that.
That would end with the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52 years, is since 1999 a member of the Board of Burda.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took charge of the treasury and with this came the responsibility for the company's heritage. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the cover of the editorial.
Burda's sons are 19 and 17 years old. his son Felix, who is currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family companies are also not safe from the decadence: “This has always affected families that let themselves be contained by the quest for capital, who have judged wrong and thought they could rise as well as the bigger player.
This has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “deliries of greatness,” says Burda.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play with the “Time” in the world league; those have become too big.
Total beauty
Everything – in the matter of beauty and well-being – you can wish, at the reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mimic of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation-; Spaxión, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdresser; Marina d'Or, which possesses a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the teteria is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the immeasurable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxing area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax them with a jacuzzi session, massage and taking a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to some virtual 'trainers' who are guiding the passes of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything begins by introducing your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to perform our exercise table correctly.
His director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretches) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairstyle, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where rituals of hair recovery, brightness or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Various Scots
Christmas is approaching and it is never more to review the stars look to adapt them to our party dressing room.
The shape of the scot, very important to raise the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated sketch.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electric company Endesa, jointly with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the route sheet for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In the end, it is intended to promote what will be the transportation of the future.
3 “Electric cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It is intended to promote the research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among these would be the activities linked to energy and in particular to energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, vislumbra "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the main exporting sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government corresponding to 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has launched throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main productive plants,” the President of the Government said.
“Thanks to this plan and the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), destined 800 million to projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both for the development of new models as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to the Plan 2000E, applied in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce in a 6% the average emissions of the new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has contributed to a "strong increase" of the registrations, which grew "a 40%" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Salon of the Classical Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motor fans.
This initiative will be developed during the days 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo of Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the motorcycle.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you will be able to find accessories, replacement, components, textile accessories, complements, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the classic motor world that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the companies participating will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sale; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sale and restoration; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Proof of Skills Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skills tests, presentations and competitions.
Skills tests will also be performed with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fair area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable Sports
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sport is not bound with respect for the environment.
Thus, it just incorporated the Mazda3 the stop and start system of the engine – under the name of i-Stop – a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its whole.
The finishes, the termination of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front blinds present an excellent ergonomy and subjection.
The touch of the wheel is also exquisite.
Following the set formed by the frame of instruments and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and commands and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the habitat, this compact Japanese has a more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All of this is added to a wide suitcase and with regular forms.
The engine’s automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre and 150 horse gasoline engine and with the six-way manual switch.
This engine is an authentic delight. it stands out for its fine, for its reduced noise, for the performance and for achieving content consumptions.
And it’s that although the Mazda3 most demanded will be the diesel versions, those who don’t do an elevated number of kilometers a year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its elevated walking comfort, as well as for its content consumption.
As for the equipment level, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of series elements.
From the series equipment stands especially the road change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the computer on board on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy bricks.
Additionally, for if it was little its equipment, this version had the Pack Premium, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon phars and BOSE sound system with disk charging, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It is highlighted by the quality of the materials used, by their behavior and by the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-heads 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only inconveniente of this model is its high price, which lies between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
Priority of Luxury
L.A. covers the sensuality red carpet of the hand of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars glowed more than ever embedded in models as elegant as 'sexys' in the 'Nine' premiere. (photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without the possibility even to see a certain type of attachments or browse the network.
He his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone’s data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnationn.
It’s just as limited as its U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up the data when you cross the border or desperately look for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and it would have been in operation for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and a good glass to read the small letter.
The European Commission’s repeated ears for achieving affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and with reason.
That an apparatus such as FonPeek (not ceasing to be curious that takes the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortise their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no gaites.
It is a connected device and it is paid for it when you buy it, not a month-to-month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime purchase option like that Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I’m going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I look forward to this because I think it’s a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American First Lady.
If he has already taken possession of Barack Obama as U.S. President with a dress and a shirt of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, undoubtedly, the second most important moment of his life: the Oslo Nobel Peace Prize collection.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar color – green brush with bright reflections – the two times the dress was composed of three pieces – dress, jacket and shirt of the same fabric – and was decorated with a large border or collar.
So much, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the star of the Princess of Asturias and had opted to repeat dress.
But the fabric in which the two clothes are made makes them very different.
If for the take of possession it was treated with a thick encounter, in Oslo it is a thirteen with stamped.
The add-ons have also varied: mid-touch green shoes again, and a similar model, but in golden, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collected on this occasion, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had labor problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study ‘Fecundity and Traffic of Women in Spain’, elaborated by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 does not leave any doubts about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of the coexistence in a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, initiate the coexistence in a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have less descendence.
“Women between 35 and 49 years with fixed work have the first child, average, 3.7 years after initiating the coexistence, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their vital trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpon the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed exercises a lot of influence on maternity although less on the schedule of parenting," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another of the factors that differentiate the age of women by marrying and having the first wardrobe.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age they marry and the first child they have.
The difference remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who have elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at the 25.1 and 32.1 average respectively.
“There is also another division between women based on their level of studies.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a child,” Delgado says.
Diane Kruger also.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envy list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become a picture of different products of the brand, entonating the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses in the international landscape, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris fichages, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such selected club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
British people have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Their highest representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – met at the annual awarding of their awards, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing at the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, were elected Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent offers in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty-three radiographies of writers who have passed through their literary life (and, in cases, also by the other).
It does not do it in the predictable and fearable genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but it is looking for something similar to the core of ignification of the creator character.
The journey has its excitations and Vicent doesn’t save stalls or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a comfortable invitation to readings and relectures.
Here I leave you some instances.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, the same I felt without giving it a name: the pleasure against the fate, the morality without guilt, and the innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegoric Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a devastating, meaningless poetic humor, like the knife she was about to kill him.”
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh conjugated the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consists in reaching heaven through the path of loss."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters high top of universal literature, which has to escalate by the northern wall, from which the best mountains are painted again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
Of himself, some times he said he was the heir of a county landman and others he was the son of a black and a cocodrile.
Both dreams were great.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the dement scream thrown from a bridge by that character of Munich to bring his echo to the bottom of the evening of the twentieth century under his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing himself and invoking the posterity with a violent speech to the gusan."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I ask you to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were recorded these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after the harsh life pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depression.
The husband normally accepted that she would tell her that Eduardo VII spy her among the Azaleas or that the birds sing in Greek.
It has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neuroscientist whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but pass Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
“What did Cela do but take away that man’s fame so that he could serve him as his own pedestal?”
The cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother of about 70 years of age walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed alongside her and our dog, an exemplar of mestiza race, rescued from the puppy and with no more than six pounds of weight and, without mediating a word, they propinated him two legs that left the dog wounded.
Our indignation is major because we don’t find the fun in a free aggression to a small and indefensive animal, which by the way, was bound.
To this it is necessary to add the suffocus that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when increped these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred at 5 a.m. on Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby commission that we doubt it serves for a lot and not to generate susceptibilities, just clarify that the coward murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand that it’s happening among young people so that they think it’s fun to abuse free of charge an indefensive animal that gives us affection, companion and friendship.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The manufacturer of Michelin tires, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to foster the use of the helmet, mainly among the younger drivers, both entities today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of suffering an accident while circulating on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing more secure products every day” and said it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new motorcycle helmet promotion campaign, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which cartels will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving the maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, since being a manufacturer of two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly secure products.
The sale of lightweight stores
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicles market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of downs, according to figures from the patronal of the manufacturers Anfac and the de sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not obscene, is worth putting it in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is done - November 2008- was bad, with a decrease of 60% relative to the previous year.
Consequence of this is that, despite the last month, the matriculations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold all the vehicles that make up the sastre box of the light commercials: derived from tourism, pick-up, furgonets, light furgons and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So that to the restrictions that the closed grip of bank credits implies, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In front of this panorama and unlike the tourism, the aid to the purchase of the 2000E has little served.
They can be welcomed, in addition to the individuals, the autonomous and SMEs who are going to acquire a light trade of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam again remembered the need to pay special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial (cams and buses).
The sales association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a decline in sales (for tourism and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency removal is mandatory.
As it happened with the ABS brake anti-block and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, it is already in all new-matriculated tourism and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of lack is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by their way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency brake assistant what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the brake that the driver gives.
But this does not always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them did not take all the strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in turn, requires the maximum to the brake system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 deadly accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided a year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four human damage accidents would be avoided – when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device makes the maximum effort to the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors delay plans for Opel to January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – the day 8 probably – according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each point of the plan has been previously consensus by the affected party.
And this can make the definitive document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories, delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, from GM it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not strange that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM acknowledges having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also seeks to acquire Volvo, but covers the choice of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China Baic.
It remains the decision to close Saab by the end of the year if it is not sold.
Review of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and face jewelry, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed it to lose no less than 80 pounds, leaving the basculus in just 1,275 pounds.
This led them to prescind, first of all, from the automatic roof that has been supplemented by one of lona with manual action, with which they save 21 pounds; using aluminum doors like the GT3, 'caen' other 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel deposit from 64 to 54 liters, they earned 7 pounds more; mounting sports bacquets other 12 and with the light tires of 19 inches, five.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door shooters for some of the fabric, the remaining kilogram.
Although it is also offered with the PDK double embrace shift, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box unit, mainly by California secondary roads, in mountainous tracks with really reversed tracks.
Their behavior can only be qualified as intachable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not pull the asphalt with aplome.
Instead, all the opposite: for a long time we did not test a model so small and light that, at the same time, transmits so much security in the passage by curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles in a short walk during the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, to freeze, to recover and again to express his motor.
Thanks to your direction, as communicative as precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And you will do it with a surgical accuracy.
Sound of the engine
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the bramid of the engine, already premiered earlier in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from standing or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car well digested the baches.
The electronic aid barely made an act of presence throughout the trail; and that that in some of the curves we find ice at the dawn and gravel, already entering in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, of the most fun driving one can on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
Intima of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodigates her male face with as much contumacy as her Chanel pockets.
More than ‘Bad Girl’ or ‘It Girl’, it’s a ‘Bag Girl’.
The Baskonia gives a victory in Israel
The Labor Box achieved a brilliant triumph by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous downs with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way it lies in the leadership of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples noted was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Victorian team knew to supply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although he had to suffer until the final to make himself with the victory.
In addition, the great deal from the perimeter, with 16 triple notes had much to see in the final triumph.
The match started in front of the blaugranes, who put themselves from the beginning in front of the markers.
That the first four canastes of the Victorians were from the perimeter, it was predicted that they had jumped to the Israeli field with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with pits and applause in the return to which he was home, to continue expanding his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' of Splitter's rating had already made it predict that it would not be this the best night of the Brazilian.
But the match, despite being shrinked to the rest, was not determined or much less and the Macabeans wanted to remind the Victorians that in their field they won no one, and with 'the hand of Elia' pressing they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to making the ‘frogs’ turn to the bright (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to hill a pair of games with a good way to catch air, and in those arrived Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the mark to a calming income (54-67), who managed to make the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavesians went out to leave the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by faults, Ivanovic's didn't precipitate, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match had already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
The injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting.
The Unicaja strangely lost in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the leadership of the group B of the Euroliga, in a match marked by the downs of the cajists, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaysian team was not scared by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship and not by the rival entity, the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
A aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, scattered the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him the turn to the score 22-20, minute 13, moment in which an action, battle, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, supposed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function showing its superiority within both areas, where the injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez, were sliding the cashers.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian alero Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even came to match the difference of the match disputed in Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leadership tighten.
The Unicaja attempted to overlap the absences and the last down of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it pressed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area showed itself unstable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to reboot the basket average 81-62, 37 minutes, and the Unicaja turned off, delivering the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified real estate, employment and motor ads in Spain.
The tool How much should you pay? calculates the wages of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must introduce their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the search engine has detected that in general lines the Spanish worker "seets badly paid," said in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data that Trovit has from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45.226 euros gross annually and a French, 31.059, against the 24,000 that a Spanish receives.
In the same way, a driver costs 34,247 net euros annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst remunerated work in Spain is the work of camarero, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the work of dependent, with 14,725 euros; and the work of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver job, the middle-day job and the social worker job.
Brazil sets date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set him deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The Deputy President must leave the diplomatic legation at the latest on January 27, 2010, when he would officially conclude his term.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
“He has consciousness that he has to leave on January 27, when he ends his term, he has to look for another destiny.”
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election of November 29 (in which he was elected Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya said he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the condition of political asylum that he intended to impose on him the "de facto" government that presides Roberto Micheletti.
much thanks
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, uncertainty again reappears in the markets, which should not be surprised since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchase and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar to rates close to zero so that financial entities could buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they begin to throw some sand into the grants as the ECB did with its yearly sale next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without so heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversion of the reduction of risk primes.
The volatilities of the stock exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have repeated again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached in early year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a quality flight and the US, Japan and Germany have been the shelter chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this unstability episode but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review to the low rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty doesn’t come wrong to calm the moral risk defenders who tried again to raise awareness over the leaders of world economic policy for having removed the destructive effects derived from credit restriction on employment destruction, when what should be done is to decreet a new Thanksgiving Day.
Nevertheless, Dubai's painting is a tribal struggle between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates and Greece's we have seen it before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections, and a new government that throws out of the hand.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin saves Hungary from a non-fulfillment of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a euro member country to breach its commitments.
What has logic is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with a transitional risk premium normalization episode, after some excesses in apalanced positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differentials extend like European corporate bonds we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and our differentials continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review up their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the load with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augure a lot of life hope to their warning.
Again, it has all the pinta that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment “prudence, friend driver”.

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommission of the Congress of Deputies in which these days the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is debated.
After his intervention, to which he followed the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a pinch of what he had proposed in the subcommission at closed door.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros until 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants remain open today in operation.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95.000 billion.
That yes, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing and the power will already need to be increased.
Its stake focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, he considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that’s yes, with other “support energies”.
Galán, who considers that the project of Sustainable Economy that has just approved the Government is in line with what his company has come claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts the policies of fighting climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "puntual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola named them.
Whatever it is, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be taken already because they are late to mature and it is necessary a stable retributive framework to address them.
Ferrovial wins the 'handling' of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Ferrovial subsidiary for land airport services, Swissport, will play the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá of Henares signed a collaboration protocol to create the Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance contemplates an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which a 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the centers’ tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona pugna for her first concession highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work in play is the one of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to sit in the country as a construction and concessionary of highways.
The City Council wants it to be done by the end of 2014.
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to get the project forward, in a business plan handled by Erns & Young, the Administration has already a final list of candidates to do with the work and exploit the peak.
Waiting for their offers in May, the investment is expected to reach $1.7 billion (1.047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums compete with a remarkable presence of European constructors.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liza, and its colleagues are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian constructors, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium is playing against the Acciona team, with the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Constructor Group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the crib is the so-called LBRJV, where they share capital the Australian Leighton (filial of the German constructor Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil work Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it brings a clear difficulty in entry if not by the way of the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a subject pending for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Just ACS has achieved a position on that market through its 30% share in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
millionaire assets
It is a geographical area of maximum importance for the sector, in which it has already highlighted presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of the deforestation.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind park, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing the Adelaide dew, with a budget of 700 million.
Their intention is now to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground peak route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Northern Link), is called to connect Toowong’s western highway with the circumvalation route in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two roads per sense, an electronic peak system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its funding.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to give notable fruits to Hochtief, who announced yesterday the achievement of a contract with the Government worth 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the construction project of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the Australian city of Brisbane.
Now in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centers for 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC adjudicates a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million dollars
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 kilometers long tunnel for a Slovenia highway for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The signature achieves this contract days after making the construction of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore Adjudicates Renfe’s Advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for approximately three million euros annually, the railway operator.
Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that presented to the contest called by Renfe of which four were finalists, among them TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom to pay $63 million for breaking up competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviors in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile phones with the signature of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programs beyond the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting traps to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competitive authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and that, therefore, is a reincident.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the star of other operators and has opened an internet app store, with the aim of increasing the incomes that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that more money have earned in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. it is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
It is so, that the competition has distributed 5.362,5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the season 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have gone off.
The white club has been the third in the continent that more money has been packed for participation, and the only, along with AC Milan, that has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct Cup of Europe in 1992, is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, more money were charged for participating in the past Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that more money has achieved through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure that the UEFA applies.
For this exercise, the body that presides Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money the UEFA will dedicate 413,1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous round of classification (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they compete.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for empathing (400,000 for each team).The eight-finalists will perceive three million each; the eight-quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be packed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist’s 5.2 million.
So, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, packed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But it is that there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main, and has four assigned places.
The champion of the previous year remains with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches that are played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group broke out the details of the stock purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a top of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not oblig you to launch a public offer of acquisition (opa) for the totality of the securities.
In particular, New Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share that would be paid off in 10 years and that would be remunerated with an interest for said 1% annual delay.
Yesterday Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the New Rumasa offer valued the company 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerezan group gives a period of 15 days for the shareholders to communicate their interests in selling securities.
The CNMV said it was not informed of the offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateos said it had contacted the regulator.
If it was made, the refund would reach 611.7 million when Sos’s capitalization is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructurate its direction.
In an attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial vaivens of their former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as the director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to occupy a high post in the food company.
This is a new creation position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company continues to be immersed in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to societies of the Salazar.
In fact, it cannot be discarded that over the coming months Sos will reveal new fund deviations.
Related to the credit to the Salazar, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorizes the Paternina exclusion opa presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the ope of exclusion presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina last October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms match the current rules and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the modifications introduced last December 2.
The CNMV has precised that the offer is directed to the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing a 8.95% of its social capital, which is composed of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchange.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which will not be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, from which he specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of current regulations.
New tools to perite cars
In these days of weather and accidents, not only win the car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are removed to a workshop, where an expert must evaluate the damages suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinistre is the same, and the calculation of the cost of pieces and the time of work can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces of work, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service and maintenance solutions providers are committed to collecting the information supplied by manufacturers, then elaborating it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of taxation tools and the elaboration of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be treated does not cease to increase, to the point that in the last five years have been launched versions, variants ymotorizations that in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes to the market, these companies begin to work.
It is a very hard job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, from each model a “intelligent” graphic image is made where different parts of tourism can be “pinched”.
If it’s a ventmasive model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it’s a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, U.S., Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in concrete brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in elaborating these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing waste parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of the used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but yes in the United States.
In view of the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard sinist assessment solution, intended for experts.
Includes light or heavy cars, motorcycles and industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the manufacturer’s estimated repair times or paint barems.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each evaluation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Afterwards, each insurance company, which makes thousands of peritations, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only with its backdrop number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to rise by the vehicles declared total sinist.
Your statistical service is very useful to identify trends, make geodemographic analyses or know the deviations by homodel brands.
You can study, for example, how many models of a given brand have passed through the workshop due to failures or how many have suffered serious sinistries in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to pieces or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions for damage assessment, failure or car maintenance.
The Gt Taxation Guide is its historic reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 they paid 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The global billing of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, a 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter 19.1 million euros, a 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares are worth $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's index.
The Internet of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, a platform on the internet for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation resulted in a reimbursement of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more added value services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, shifts and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.

Workshop Budget in 4 Steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the exchange, create a budget and generate a budget.
The ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince the older professionals, that in greater or lesser extent they tend to be more disgusting to using new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 all-terrainers, 137 motorcycles, 78 furgonets and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified using its background number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the labour price, recharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can fund.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
