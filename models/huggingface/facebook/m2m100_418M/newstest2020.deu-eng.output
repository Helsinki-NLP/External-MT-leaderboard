Fire in a French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. this was by the Normandy prefecture on Friday. the fire was broken out in the night on Thursday. no one was injured in the incident. the firefighters were operated with approximately 200 firefighters.
The fire was ordered.
Trains were called not to leave their houses. buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical factory on the shore of the Seine are made additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso EU Directive, which requires strict safety requirements.
The chemistry factory already provided in the past for tracks - for example, when in 2013 through a leak the gas methantiol was dissolved and the surrounding area was largely smoked by dirty eggs. In 2015, after an operation accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flows into the city's wastewater system.
A woman resigns her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington sought her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie was pulled out of the hotel room during a short holiday in Montana. 57 days missed any trace from the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was bad," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they then returned to the hotel, Katie was missing. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner has put a dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers to "Daily Inter Lake."
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings were searching for their beloved dog. But days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who announced her job as a postal employee to continue her search for Katie.
“The tears flow”
57 days after Kate's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man logged in and said that Katie was in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie was already disappeared again. She sought the neighborhood and suddenly her dogman stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want her to go," King remembered according to "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. The people stopped in their vehicles, climbed out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Loss at the Bundeswehr: Machinery weapons disappear tracelessly
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machinery weapons are still missing.
In the past years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. among them are also three machinery weapons. The remaining is in most cases unclear.
Since the beginning of 2014, the army has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 20,000 shots of ammunition.
According to the paper from the office of Defence Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3474 shoot munitions have been reappeared.The remaining missing weapons and pieces of weapons include six MG3 type machinery weapons, eleven G3 type weapons, four G36 type weapons, six signal weapons and two P8 type weapons.
The scope of weapons and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr is "frightening," said the left-wing Bundestag deputy Martina Renner. This applies even more, as in the course of investigations nothing has been discovered again. the left-wing politician spoke of a "fair balance". Renner criticized that on the listing it is unrecognizable whether among the missing ammunition is also the one that was found in connection with the investigations against the terror suspected Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves Iran's port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ships observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. As the target port Port Rashid was indicated in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was actually released on Monday by the Iranian government, but he was first staying in Iranian waters.
The "Stena Impero" was launched on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Sea Street of Hormuz under the accusation of violating security provisions, but it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea streets in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped through the sea range. The tensions in the region have been tremendously aggravated in the past months. The trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the United States and Iran. It has occurred several interruptions with tanks and drones.
Merkel honors the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has honored the commitment of the people in the DDR who have gone on the streets 30 years ago in the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, brave citizens had brought the then DDR regime into the dungeon, Merkel said at a fixed act of the Thüringer CDU group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt.
Musk is struggling to record extradition
Tesla Quartal may keep a record ready. Despite the delivery boom, there were last losses in the electric car company.
Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong rise on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. “We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 sales,” Musk wrote in an email published by the industry blog “Electrek” to Tesla employees.
The demand is strong so that Tesla could register 110,000 orders, the challenge is to bring the cars quickly to customers.
Investors liked that: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. So strongly the price has not risen for four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. for this, six-point numbers must be made in the current and upcoming quarter of the year. above all the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the gains are small. despite the boom there were last losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't kiss ourselves
This was discovered by scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they on Thursday evening.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the approaching of a knitting hand triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep-flowing layer in the big brain, which triggers laughter already when the knitting is waiting.
According to the data, previous research has shown that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are choked by humans. This "laughter" is transmitted through the part of the colon, which serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
So far it has been assumed that the brain can differentiate between self-touching and touching by others – that is why people can’t kiss themselves. But the Berliner researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the concerned area of the large brain nodes are suppressed during self-touching. This is also the case when living beings wash themselves. During the stranger touching and kissing by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh was increased.
But if the self-touch and the touch of others pass at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicated that the rat’s brain could not distinguish between the self-touch and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people can’t kiss themselves because the self-touch activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to catch themselves.Therefore, they break this initiation in the experiment so sometimes premature, showed escape behavior or horror.This ambivalence is the same as the behavior of the children.The ambivalence of the catch is a behavior reaction that is the same for rats and humans.
Disaster eliminated: Large fire in a chemical plant in France
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted, the Normandy prefecture told AFP on Friday.
The samples taken don’t give any reason to worry, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident.
Schools and kindergartens are closed
Inhabitants were called not to leave their houses. buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in the parliament after the abolition of the forced break on Wednesday night. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country on October 31 without an agreement from the EU, if Brussels should not adhere to his demands for amendments to the Brexit agreement.
About Cox, who had committed to the remaining of Britain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honor the memorial of Jo Cox and this country back to one would be to complete the EU departure." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Remembrance of attacks in Oslo and Utöya
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial to the victims will be revealed on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Iron Rosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They remind the roses that thousands of people had placed in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dome in Oslo.
At the same place, the project will now be revealed by artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud – the roses were disguised by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims.
On July 22, 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first burned a bus bomb in the government district of Oslo and then killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the Social Democratic Workers' Youth Organization on the island of Utöya.
Iran releases British tanks
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iranian conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tank "Stena Impero" detained in Iran could get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle in the Iranian President's peace plan.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" detained in the road of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, according to Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now on, among other things, for medical examinations to Dubai, Reedereichef Erik Hånell said. by noon the ship has left the Iranian waters. "It's good that it's over," he told Swedish TV SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London declared the establishment of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. we work with our international partners to preserve shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on July 19 under the accusation of ignoring the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are going well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They would have behaved professionally over the last ten weeks given the difficult and exciting situation. The fishing industry is now working to bring them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: there was at the beginning of July a super tanker with oil from Iran, which was intended to be for Syria, placed on the chain.
The Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. in mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. assumptions that it was a trade deal to release the "Stena Impero" revealed London vehement back.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea streets in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the sea range. The tensions in the region have been tremendously aggravated in the past months. The trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the United States and Iran. It has occurred several interruptions with tanks and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries.The Americans call on the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons.The Iran rejects that.The U.S. had out of the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation.Since then, the U.S. government has put the leadership in Tehran under pressure with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended agreement to other areas.
Due to the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for the military protection of the trade ships in the region.
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani has presented a plan for security and peace in the Hormus Street at the UN General Assembly in New York, with the initiative "coalition of hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner."Given the penalties imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to relocate.Financial leaders of Asian companies considering to move their production from China to another country call India in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives.This, of course, has not only to do with the invisibility of the Chinese-American trade war.With a huge pool of young workers as well as an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to play a more significant role in the widespread global production.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump’s focus. From the White House’s devaluation as “the kingdom of duties”, America has removed the trade benefits for 2000 products to the emerging country in early June. The U.S. imposes forbidden high duties on India and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, drinks, motorcycles and more.
On the map of the world trade wars, the shields with India, of course, are just a side spot. In addition, America sees the world’s largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington unite concerns about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. In this background, a salve of U.S. penalties against India is unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is therefore likely to be safe.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically heated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a severe situation in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. His reformator mainly aims to the bureaucratic irresistance that in the multinational state for too long hovered any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for appearing companies with high debt to liquidate faster.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic point of view, in India in the first five fashion years many things have turned to better. But in trade policy this does not apply. From this, to protect low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national-conservative government even set up new barriers.
In the West, Modi lies with the Nimbus of the energetic reformator, who economically radically renews his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never withdrew from a protektionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronist procedures and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the disruption of their branches belong to the tribes of the Modis nationalist Bharati Janata Party and this short-looking policy.
Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried next week in Paris.The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency with reference to the family of Chiracs. The burial will take place in the close family circle.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the Light Athletics World Cup
The world's peak has long been at the goal when heated scenes were played in the hidden Khalifa International Stadium. In the first course of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to move dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his feet 300 meters ahead of the goal, running in unhealthy attitude, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly hit him and supporting him the last half of the stadium round dropped to the goal.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists on himself. horrors he first went out, he didn't want to talk about his heroic status at all. Finally he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that it would be difficult, he only wanted to help a sufferant. And anyway he would only be proud to represent his country that was invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances he could not even start. "Therefore I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this at the evening with strong pressure - and much more intense than he thought. Because this heroic attack will remain in memory. Especially because Dabo even left his competitor Busby the performance in the target and voluntarily took the last place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this course. It was not used at the end, because the Busby, who arrived in the target with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Light Athletics Association at the end.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, had entered to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. This succeeded according to official data with 18:10,87 minutes, he himself was yet disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes.
Million Masks: Egyptians Call for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were closed.
For the past few days, police had strengthened their road controls and searched the pedestrian cell phones in part on news and photos related to the protests.
The opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They turned against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic accusing corruption and abuse. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not been in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali living in the Spanish exile, who took the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for this Friday to a "Million March" at central places in the country. Ali calls for a "People's Revolution." The man is for most young Egyptians, though, "there's not because he was a sub-manager for the millions of army, but he came to his messages.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1, 570 detainees until Friday, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) talked about more than 2,000 detainees.
Voluntary arrest
Many people were “willfully arrested” “only because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time,” HRW, calling at lawyers detainees. The accusations against the detainees range, according to their lawyers, from “proliferation of false information” to membership in a “terrorist association.” In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were interrogated and searched in uniforms, but also in civil clothes, according to HRW, also arbitrarily passants.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the north African country.The government blocks websites and online services in Cairo in order to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online traders: shipping traders should be able to donate returns easier
For online traders, many returned packages are lost goods. about 20 million returns land on the waste.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando a way they can donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies cannot be exempt from the sales tax on subsidies, the ministry said on a question from the Green-Bundestag faction, which the newspapers of the Funke-Media Group on Friday. however, the merchants could put the market value of non-sales returns so low that they had to pay no or little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens returned each sixth package when orders on the internet. about four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in waste. to donate them would cost the companies according to the current legal situation additional money, since the financial authorities assess the material donations as a turnover, which then falls on the turnover tax.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a resolution that companies can not sell products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online trading, but also to other from the model store to the construction market.
Banksy art at auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
Streetart star Banksy’s known work, “Devolved Parliament”, is scheduled to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy’s work emphasizes “the reconstruction of the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy into the foundation characterized by animals and tribes.” From Saturday, the painting is scheduled to be exhibited at Sotheby’s in the British capital until it is scheduled to be auctioned on October 3.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time with the original Brexit date on March 29.
The image could change the owner for a million.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a harsh shift with the opposition on Wednesday at the first House meeting after the Supreme Court repealed a forced break imposed by Johnson. Johnson wants to carry out the already twice delayed Brexit on 31 October, if necessary, without any agreement with the EU.
It’s not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in Southeast England, he painted a picture that depicts a man breaking a star of the European flag with a mesh. The work is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors when entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson's violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "trait" to the people. accusations that he could put the MPs in danger because they could be the target of murder threats, he turned down as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to restore peace is if the MPs would finally respect the decision of Britain to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were overwhelmed that Britain has not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the loaded mood, even the Bishops of the Anglican Church called for refusal on Friday. ”We should speak with respect to each other,” it said in a statement. ”And we should also listen.”
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on his first appearance before the UN Plenary Assembly again urged the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the United Nations General Meeting in New York. "If it goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial domination in 1947, two of which surround the divided region of Kazakhstan. The two nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kazakhstan, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had removed the autonomy status of the Indian region of Kazakhstan and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan dramatically.
Not even a bottle of water.
Protesters in Cairo call for the collapse of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government is reacting with harsh hand. It lets the population shoot with sharp ammunition, more than 2,000 prisoners sit in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been dangerous. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like in the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. poverty, unperspective and the feeling of being stumbled by its own government push millions on the streets. And this is a problem that the El-Sisi regime does not get in control, no matter how hard it is against opponents.
Today, every third in Egypt lives below the poverty limit. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who it is funding: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi so. With authority regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, the dilemma in the supermarket is an old thing.
Tüv tests at the terminal: BER chief: No "showstopper" anymore for the capital airport
Two months have been checked whether the complicated installation field in the BER border protection works in cooperation. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
Following large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said there are still defects to work in the terminal. "We have a lot of detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper."
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large.The construction completion announcement is now planned to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortcomings in electric cables are still to be fixed; the Tüv wants to review them until February. “To create the conditions for the opening of the flight operation here, it is necessary to continue to work intensely on the removal of the shortcomings,” it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dusts on which the cable trails hang. The airport manager expects that this will be present until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet satisfying. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke cuts that fall down in a fire like a wall so that the smoke does not spread. They run too far down. 36 engines therefore need to be exchanged. Then there will be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree angels as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally it should be in operation in 2011. The costs have increased since the beginning of the construction in 2006 from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsibilities are planning the expansion of the airport. therefore it is expected to take place in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. finance chief Heike Fölster changes to the German Railway at the end of the year, staff chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen goes in retirement next year, as Bretschneider said. he thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automated for Drugs: Police Arrested Man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several machines into the air in the Chemnitzer city area for that!
In the last two years, the number of broken cigarette and parking tickets machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased significantly.
Police found a 33-year-old German at the Bürgerstraße and Furtherstraße in Chemnitz after two detonations in late May.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: “In the course of the investigations concerning the carrying out of explosives explosions in the Tate unit with a severe case of the theft conducted by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed.”
Compared to the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer has now committed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman said: "It is apparently that he has funded his drug addiction." Only four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 the bomber had struck parking machines on the Civil Road.
The total damage caused is at least 60,000 euros!
The automate bomber is now in detention and the police investigations against him are ongoing.
It is believed that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and neighboring countryside.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the middle of the price struggle with cheap aircraft such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over the "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a spokesman of Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday to the APA.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa aircraft Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", that is, including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg in the future three Eurowings aircraft will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to vacation destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA Triangle Cross and network planning, the spokesman said. the flight times will be coordinated on connection flights. the goal is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Triangle Cross in Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the group sisters AUA. Thus, among other things, Barcelona and Rome will be served with the AUA flight number, but primarily with the Eurowings device. The boarding product should be adapted to the one by Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight companions are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights starting under the AUA flight number are according to the report no longer made in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
Ryanair's daughter Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it will deploy the fleet in Vienna next summer on 16 aircraft.The Irish cheap fighter will send for it four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the trade union criticized as an enlightenment structure to the collective agreement.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary's campaign statement that Lauda will have overcome the AUA in five years, said AUA chief Andreas Otto on Friday: "We will remain the number one on the site, in five, six or ten years."

Study of Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really dissolves a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburger researchers now want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9,000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out more in detail the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. the Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12.5 million euros. from Switzerland, the Davos High Mountains Clinic, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the major influential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk with. The interaction between genes and external influences is only not enough known, he said. Now the scientists want to compare the full survival of 8,000 healthy people with the one of 1,000 former patients at the University Heart and Vessel Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of about 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-powered changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - according to the clinic.
The goal of the five-year project is, according to the initiators, to develop new options such as for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other popular diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Heart and Vaginal Center. New discoveries about the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidneys as well as cancer diseases are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a firm will to use the data also for the investigation of other diseases. The Foundation’s clinic in Davos so far treats primarily allergies. Now on the medical campus there should be created a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and a professor of bioinformatics. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The biological tests of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study" with 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In hereditary encryption, strictly respected the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich said.
Today, according to UKE, a person's heritage can be decrypted within 24 hours. The net cost for it is 1300 euros. The world's first gene sequencing, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on 1 October, already at the end of 2020, all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed.
Nigerian police release hundreds of kidnapped
In Nigeria, police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Coran school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and found some of the remaining minor victims, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
In fact, the guardians were detained by their teachers under "the most decent and unhuman conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine years, were attached in a small room.
According to the information, the Coran school has been in place for about ten years. inhabitants had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. the parents had been shocked when they were informed about the condition in the Coran school, Sabo said. they had no idea of the suffering of their children. the operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In mostly Muslim northern Nigeria there are many private coran schools. they replace the often defective state institutions. the people in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bonds. According to the UN Refugee Aid, therefore over the last ten months more than 40,000 people fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger.
Arrested and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
Police have released 400 students from terrible circumstances at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were attached and some had visible injuries indicating torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in Kaduna.
The children were found there on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school where the conditions were "unhuman" and officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were kept in their school as slaves and placed on chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed dismissed and injured students in a noticeably poor health condition.
World football elections: More accusations against Messi and Klopps Kur
Football "Subscription is not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Federation (FIFA) lists the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After Nicaragua's captain declared he never voted in the World Football Election, accusations came from other countries to the FIFA.
Many things in the FIFA have turned out to be annoying in the past years: the World Cup statements, the doubtless plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. The FIFA World Soccer election has not yet fallen into the suspicion of unclean departure - when it comes to the fact that the voting rightful national coaches and national team captains of the associations often vote more for sympathy than for objective assessment.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he did not vote at all, there are now more disagreements: Egypt complained that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
The FIFA apologizes to the extent that "the signatures on the election forms were issued in large letters and therefore not valid."The Egyptian Federation has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without any answer.
Swedish coaches are surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is clear, the Sudanese Federation indicates that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not voted as it was eventually assessed: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk in place two and Sadio Mané in place three.
Accusations had also raised Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "I didn't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. all the details about my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote.
From the association came the message on Friday: Yes, but, of course, there was no intention. The filled electoral documents were “irreformally” provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a statement of the association. but actually chosen the second captain Manuel Rosas. “We take responsibility for the administrative error,” it was said in the statement. Both Rosas and team trainer Henry Duarte, however, had voted for Messi, “just as it is in the official FIFA list.”
The other cases are now being examined by the FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process has been externally supervised by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long Lionel Messi remains the first time uncontroversial winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine affairs: high-ranking Republicans call for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans openly spoke for an official investigation against the U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Republican Governor of the U.S. Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, it is determined by the facts that are found." he wants to know more about the whistleblower case before measures are taken. an impeachment procedure can lead to the president's resignation.
These had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far resigned with criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower case, but few have revealed discomfort. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia has already repeatedly turned against Trump's policy, for example against the locking of environmental regulations and the strengthened immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go on its foundation."
Scott and Baker, as governors of the U.S. states, have formally failed to negotiate in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore primarily symbolically important. However, the first Republican senators have also criticized the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the Utah State in the second parliamentary Chamber, said the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing."
The case could be in the opening of an investigation proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation about it. they accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue a so-called Impeachment, but the decision on a real withdrawal fell in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority, and the prospects for the success of such a procedure are therefore small.
Are tortured on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for rape and murder in Libya’s refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unlawfully travelled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was repealed after a few days by an Italian judge.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the Sea-Watch 3.The suspects have been captured in a reception camp in Messina (Sicilia) after migrants have recognised their anger in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have secure information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer to the German Press Agency.
The police said in the middle of September that the suspects were raped, tortured and even murdered in the north African country. It is Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically scammed and exposed to horrors - by repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said at that time.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. they come without passports," said Neugebauer. torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. therefore it's quite likely that there are also criminals on the ships. "It's therefore very important that it's followed."
Former Italian Justice Minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks a record for Tesla's extradition
Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk has given a strong rise on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers to his electric car company.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong so that Tesla could register 110,000 orders, the challenge is to bring the cars quickly to customers.
Investors liked that: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with a plus of over six percent. So strongly the price has not risen for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a lot of 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to his high targets. in 2019, he will deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. for this, six-point numbers will be made in the current and upcoming quarter of the year. above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the gains are small. despite the boom there were last losses.
US Budget Dispute: Only a Bridge Financing Again
The new budget year will start in the U.S. on 1 October without a proper budget. the Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise the expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the U.S. is once again without expenditure plans before the new fiscal year starting on 1 October.The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November.
Shutdown is removed
For instance, the Federal Administration will now be funded at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year that ends on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. The Federal Administration therefore cannot now benefit from the expended expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority; but the draft laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans; on the contrary, the Senate also has ten of the twelve draft plans more or less prepared, which are hardly majorityable.
In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the construction of the wall and its financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the construction of the wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The walls divide the spirits.
Currently, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve output laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21.
In the background of the persistent incapacity of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown gain ideas to automatize the process to popularity. Proposal S. 1877 to avoid shutdown would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year level, interrupt the travel activity of the parliamentarians and retain their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France permits artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is expected to be open for single women and lesbians in the future: the Parisian National Assembly voted with a large majority for a government bill that allows all women to use an in vitro fertilization.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future numerous “children without a father” could grow up.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that health minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents.
Fertilization with the sperm of the dead husband
With a small majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment proposal, which should give wives access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial fertilization is permitted "post-mortem." In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women misleadingly complained about the release of the sperm of a dead. The opponents of the protest in Paris argued that such a fertilized child then carries a "specially severe fate."
Numerous members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members have opposed the artificial fertilization with the sperma of the deceased partner.They emphasized that a widow will be subjected to a "double sadness" if by the death of her husband even her child wish remains unfulfilled.
The initiators of the failed amendment proposal consider it unfair that in the future a widow may be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is allowed only to heterosexual couples who cannot give birth to children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that lease maternity remains prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women – for single or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Climate compensation: calls for flight charges for Unis will be more loud
There is a lot to fly to the universities. therefore the country wants to let a climate tax be paid there in the future. the rectors say they have no money for it. but now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discourse over a climate tax on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer break, is coming back in the flow. After the state directors' conference had skeptically responded to a corresponding move from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a Pedagogical College advocate for a compensation for service flights. This is as the first step "necessarily necessary", at the same time, there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it is said in their opinion. The initially already in July planned cabinet decision is on the ice, because the CDU has not always made it.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees were allegedly illegal fishing in Russian waters. Ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were already arrested. At that time there was a shooting exchange between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered serious injuries. This time there were no injured, it said.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortage.The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters.There the coastal guard of Russia, according to its own statements, is carrying patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 fish captured
During the re-controlls, 30,000 tinted fish were discovered and captured on the boats. in addition, the information was captured after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
The Russian fishing authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, according to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have been temporarily arrested this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. they fought with in Russia banned narrow synthetic networks. with these also would pick up small living beings from the sea.
Next Next post: Only 18,000 in the future: U.S. cuts asylum excess
“The greatest nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The wealthiest country on earth is shaking down against seekers of protection: As the U.S. Department confirms in Washington, the maximum limit for the legal withdrawal of refugees will be further reduced.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low border for the reception of new refugees again. In the financial year 2020, which runs in the U.S. from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be left in the country, as the U.S. Foreign Ministry said.
President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the readiness for seekers of protection from all over the world in recent years.
The fixed border of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980.The U.S. Foreign Ministry, however, described the United States as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation strongly reminding the U.S. President's language use.
A “responsible treatment” with refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their homeland to help reconstruction there, Trump said.
A major dispute point is the border to Mexico, which Trump wants to shut down. To be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. It is unclear whether there is a timely link between the current action and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyj case and a potentially threatening withdrawal procedure.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqi people who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are therefore in danger, according to the Foreign Ministry's statement.
The United States wants to that people in particular from this "northern triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. In this context, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to prevent migration at the U.S. southern border to Mexico.
The court orders the release of Orang-Utan from the Zoo
A Orang-Utan woman has been transferred from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires to a human apes arrest station in the United States on the request of the Argentine justice. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostocker Zoo has been granted the rights of a "non-human person" so her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday night by direct flight - however not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms weighing human affin is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, it is expected to live in the outskirts of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 schimpans, among them "Bubbles", former popstar Michael Jackson's pet. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" will still have to pass an approximately 40 day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process for "Sandras" fundamental rights has contributed to the transformation of the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023 it is planned to create a research and education site for the preservation of species diversity.
Switzerland record: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extremist Dani Arnold has a new Husarenritt on the almost 3000 meters high Grand Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a network, double ground or other facilities, the Switzerland's 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinne was recorded in a new time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute freedom, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to rise.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important North Walls in Europe.
Nike Benefits of New Online Marketing Strategy
The U.S. sports item manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit plus despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit increased to $1.4 billion (only €1.3 billion) in the last quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the previous year period, as the group on Tuesday. The reason for this is mainly the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor addresses directly to its customers online.
In the three-month period until the end of August, sales increased to $10.7 billion. The strongest increased Nike sales numbers with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also in the People's Republic benefited from its approach to direct consumers through the Internet or smartphone apps.
Finance chief Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to advance the "digital transformation" of the sports item manufacturer with strategic investments and thus increase its competitive advantage. The investors reacted with pleasure to the quarterly figures - the sports item manufacturer's shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus was scammed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then posted the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. he the fan’s account on Instagram and the police. in addition, the Roma supporters will never be allowed to visit a match of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans scandalize racist misconduct against black players of competing teams. “We can’t have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that’s very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The reason for the statement were racist songs at the First League match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now confirmed 38 randaliing fans of the record champion Juventus Turin with stadium prohibitions. Four of them may no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said.
The fans are associated with the ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fang groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, of severe persecution, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the investigations into the role with an announcement last year.
The ultra leaders are expected to be behind the black trade with tickets, according to Italian media reports, they had "military controlled" the ticket trade for the Fankurve and are expected to have pressed Juventus employees to get to cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political – all the years are thought with graceful names. If you look closer, the awards are full of contradictions. How well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs come!" with this call officially started the crab opening on the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on 21 September, prompting the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as the Department of Public Work of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee announced.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outlet of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal environmental conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent waters and 50 percent fields." The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already begun the grapefruit in the early 1990s. Over time, the grapefruit industry has evolved into a characteristic industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In the past years, Gaochun has actively strived for a large, ecological and scientific development of grapefruit as well as a tech-backed grapefruit. And the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to “distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services” and carefully built the service network for “approvals under one roof, a team for prosecution, a network for services, a platform for crediting.”
Gaochun fully exploits the benefits given on the site by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an advance to promote intelligent high-end production plants, companies for biomedical and medical engineering, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors as well as plants for ecological agriculture leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-territory tourism zone and tourism transport of national importance.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Rouhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump opposes
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN Plenary Assembly, talked about a alleged U.S. proposal to abolish sanctions.The U.S. had in exchange for talks with Tehran's leadership planned an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, opposed Iran's counterpart on Twitter: "The Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed against him so that there was a meeting.
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had forced a meeting to take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added.
However, this protest is not done in an acceptable way, Rouhani criticized. given the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. background was the hopes of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron had, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Plenary Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - 200 neighborhoods
After the western Turkey was shocked in the shortest time by two earthquakes, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people have been wounded in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day there have been 200 floods, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. hundreds of buildings have been damaged. the 5.8 magnitude earthquake has shocked the Marmar region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropolitan. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay said.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for battle, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year badly built houses collapse - among other things murdered by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shoot Istanbul.
Urban planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned for years that large open areas that have been registered in the center as refuge sites have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük tree in August the building engineering chamber of Istanbul had warned that estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not ground-solid.
The epicenter of the Babes on Thursday was in the Marmarameer in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers of depth, as the Disaster Protection Authority Afad. A small breakdown caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told Twitter that injured or injured were not first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people who fled out of the houses in panic. students were brought out of the buildings in Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried as seen on the pictures.
Istanbul is regarded as land-threatened. Under the marble is a section of the so-called North Atlantic disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shocked by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the beating in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear a 7.1 to 7.4 magnitude earthquake could threaten, but when the earthquake will come is unclear.
Companies design emergency plans, individuals have so-called go-bags with everything necessary ready packed next to home doors, and schools bring children to know how to behave when the earth turns.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom).
Warning of Neighbors in Istanbul
In social networks, many users report panic. buildings shocked. schools and hospitals were evacuated. telephone lines were interrupted. it had been more violent than that of Tuesday, a user writes. the head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of settlements. He called on people to move away from buildings that would have suffered visible damage.
The time of the bribes is indicated by official information at 13.59 (local time). just a few minutes after the first bribes there was a bribes, according to CNN Turkey, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had a earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shocked the Turkish Marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara area west of the million metropolitan, the Disaster Protection Authority Afad on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made signs on Tuesday: Pakistan was also affected by a heavy earthquake.
Researchers assume that a catastrophic earthquake may occur in Istanbul sooner or later - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. it has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster.
Just a few weeks ago there had been an interruption - the flood raised great concerns also in Istanbul. in Albania there had also been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukrainian case
On the way to a possible investigation, the US Democrats are stronger: the complaint submitted by an anonymous indicator about Trump and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president raises important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself more than once as a victim of a "Hexy Hunt".
U.S.: United Airlines passenger arrested in toilet - aircraft redirected
Because a passenger was stuck in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, the airline by U.S. media.
In an unplanned intermediate landing on Wednesday night (local time) in Denver, the woman was eventually released from the narrow cabin. about an hour she had been locked in it, US media wrote, calling on other passengers. for further flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video broadcast on the Internet, which is intended to come from U.S. media from Flight 1554 is to see how several people are trying to release the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, Okay?", says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers.
The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes a Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? he writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British successful author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will appear on November 27 in German, the Diogenes Publishing (Zürich). It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now suddenly is the most powerful man in Britain.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are shamelessly lying like the former Soviet leaders, when Brexiters in high positions are just causing the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must wonder what he can do.
Kafka's first-published story is about Gregor Samsa, who one morning wakes up and sees himself "transformed into an incredible disconnection," gradually excluded by family and society, and eventually falls down. "Ian McEwan dishonors himself to Kafka to describe a world that stands in the head," the Diogenes publisher said.

This is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.The funds come from the EU infrastructure top "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
German travel operator Thomas Cook has canceled all trips until 31 October 2019 a day after his insolvency application. trips could "not be made for insolvency reasons," the company said on Thursday night.
This also affects bookings from the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travel and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it is about travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company has opened.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the Sog of the British Mother Group and had on Wednesday filed an insolvency application. The company, which includes, among other things, Neckermann Travel, Öger Tours and Bucher Travel, employs around 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to return money to hotels
In contrast, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas-Cook vacationers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance.The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that travelers will no longer be asked for additional payments, according to Zurich.
Based on the booking information and without submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts will now receive 50 percent of the remaining payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. “This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels will not be requested or otherwise compelled to pay individual invoices,” said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance agency responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on the site themselves. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Federation of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. according to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook passenger vacationers from Germany were on the way.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
The hotel payments announced by Zurich Insurance, however, will only help the travellers who are currently on the journey. For Thomas-Cook customers who are just looking to fly on holiday, it looks bad. In the late Thursday evening, the company that all travel until including 31 October will be cancelled. This also applies to such reservations that are already paid.
As it is about travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company has opened. in accordance with insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be reviewed, it said. Basically, for these cases, the insurance Zurich is also responsible.
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. customers could find information on the way to refund the travel price on the Kaera website and apply their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosion mines in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues the engagement of Lady Diana. in Africa, he is now moving directly to the traces of his mother.
Clothed with a blue split protective wall, Prince Harry has burned and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he set the ring in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. In a secure distance the explosive body exploded in the Savannah landscape, without causing any damage. Although Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly on the traces of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explorer who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she went at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious mining field in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African tour that has begun in the South African tourist metropolitan Cape Town since Monday.
Brexit negotiations: the risk of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly determined: with him there will be no third suspension of Brexit negotiations guaranteed. But what statements are with the polarizing British already for ever. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Britain flows like a Damokless sword over the blonde shoulder. His parliament suspension to be able to carry out his Brexit course strictly until the date of departure was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a parliament-approved law obliges Johnson to cause a prolongation of the bilateral talks in case of failed negotiations with the EU until October 31.
Boris Johnson says the deal is possible
Meanwhile, when he visited a hospital, he indicated that he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October in the event of a non-approval:
We will follow the law.
At the same time we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
I’m carefully optimistic that it works.
And the time runs the Brexit negotiations in Brussels gradually from it. Another about six weeks the EU and the British dealers have time to prevent a UK’s withdrawal from the European Union without any agreement. But even the latest talks have not reached a breakthrough again. A deal until the end of October seems now rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed delay of the date of withdrawal is in force. The opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words. It fears that in the event of a no-deal Johnson could somehow stop the Brexit.
U.S. authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the U.S. Health Authority CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of which confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase of lung damage is known so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the U.S.
Fear of new protests in Egypt rises
The building entrepreneur and actor living in Spain calls for a "People's Revolution" in it. For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who are criticized by corruption and abuse.
In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence to be observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were blocked. In recent days, police had strengthened their road controls and the phones of pedestrians were partly searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces responded hard according to it. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "for the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW with appeal to lawyers detained.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the north African country. Therefore, the government blocks sites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he had crushed the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs Returns from Greenland Expedition
The polar researcher Arved Fuchs has returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. he was welcomed at his arrival in the port of Hamburg among other things by skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg had brought the race jacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has been investigating and documenting the consequences of earthquake over the past few months on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coast of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar researcher said. he has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. it has been known for decades that the Earth is heating. yet many have acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," Fuchs said. he and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of earthquake and the waste of the seas. during the expedition, among other things, a drone was measured Greenland ice and fishing with microplastic networks, it said.
For his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world seas", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburger Climate Week. "For all of us who are in the heart of the ocean survival, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in the last decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid €430 for nudles
430 euros for two tables of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: That seemed two Japanese tourists too much. The invoice with 80 euros of drink money included was paid by the two women, but they posted the quotation on Facebook, causing hot reactions.
We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud,” a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, called for, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. but this is not to be taken from the bill. Even a drink money of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the host said.
U.S. President Donald Trump could actually face an investigation after the turbulent revelations of the past days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives now as quickly as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would fall.
The accusation of the whistleblower, who eventually brought the conversation to the public for concerns about the national security and democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: the president misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election.
The core of this project is to be understood in the newly published magazine of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. The July 25 telephone call, however, is just an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which next to Trump is his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the view of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the just elected president Selenskyj, and the lawyer knows himself very accurately that his intentions are weak. "We don't blend in a choice, we blend in an investigation that we have the right to," he says to the newspaper. You can think it's inappropriate, but "this is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants that in Ukraine investigations will be pursued, for which there's hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful for my clients and can be helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor appears to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump's counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton has conspired with actors in Ukraine, the critics said then to build an opportunity for the Russian investigations in the U.S. This accusation was never to be taken seriously.
The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice President and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has, as an Ukrainian representative of the Obama government, pushed for the release of the then Ukrainian general prosecutor, Viktor Schokin. That is, to stop the investigation he was responsible for the gas company, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden worked.
In fact, the course was a bit different. When Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian prosecutor to go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Shookin was also accused of profoundly corrupt harassment, the U.S. government was far from the only Western partner that urged his release.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social Media is Down
Users around the world report massive disorders on Instagram and Facebook. therefore they are affected primarily by Germany, the UK and Spain. on the website allestörungen.de users report that Facebook has not been charged since about 15.30 a.m. Instagram also releases the error message that content could not be charged. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disorder, although not in the same scale until now.
Instagram and Co. more frequently affected by disorders
It’s not the first massive disruption this year. already in March and July, the services have been out for several hours. and like in previous cases, users also this time mainly react to Twitter to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of the Antarctica. they were on the way with a shipping boat and a few miles away from their base when their engine failed. they were lucky in the accident - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed for the mining.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade
“At 9:30 we received the message, about a short time before ten we started, and good 20 minutes spàter we were over the shipping boat.”
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists work there.
Note: Smartphone is never charged without cable
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have arrived on the market, supporting wireless charging and selling very well - all of the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July.
Higher temperature makes the battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. This is, according to the findings of the University of Warwick, extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If a cell phone is normally charged by cable, the battery is heated within three hours to 27 degrees. When wireless charging, the researchers have always measured above 30 degrees, even if the smartphone is perfectly arranged on the charging board. If the cell phone is slightly next to the spool, the temperature increases even higher.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor for the durability of the battery. Therefore, each degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only reserves capacity, but it also does not last so long as a whole. The lifetime thus falls less. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone is always charged by cable. Since a battery exchange at modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this is likely to be a helpful tip. Lastly, Apple has even increased the cost of a battery exchange - and for all iPhones.
practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a corresponding charging board - these are already even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a disturbing cable salad and hard stickers. Since Qi (it is for inductive energy transmission) entails a worldwide standard, with which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are little restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should be applied only in exceptional cases.
Everest Stau Photographer: 13 thousand eight in six months
A Nepalese mountain climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in just six months.Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator said.
Purja calls his project "Mission Possible."He has once made international signs: From him comes a photo viral in the spring of mountain climbers standing on Mount Everest the serpent.
The image of the mass shooting triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest peak of the earth.
A problem for Purja could be the climb of the 14th eighth thousand: Currently Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As the reason for this is called, among other things, bad weather. Early week, Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wants to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals there is also an elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four Kadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists of the former rocks of Sigiriya. The animals, according to the police spokesman, were probably between 15 and 25 years old.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The murders are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously remained harmless. at the same time, roughly 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This happens mostly when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants living in Sri Lanka, and the death penalty is theoretically the killing of them.
British oil tank detained leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its fixation by Iran. This was by the Shipping Office of Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker under British flag on July 19 under the accusation of ignoring the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook’s Management in Criticism
The competent economic committee of the Household wants to thoroughly examine the dispute of the travel giant Thomas Cook. This is about the board’s salary packages as well as the question why the British government didn’t like to contribute financially to the company struggling to survive. “Our interest is the supervision in the company as well as the control by external auditors,” said the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of the genes in the family increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to be harder than previously thought. This has consequences for calculations of the individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk to raise Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in an email posted on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees. demand is strong so that Tesla could record 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's roundwriting.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to customers, and Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strongly, the price has not risen for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95’000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. for this, six-point numbers must be made in the current and upcoming quarter of the year. especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the gains are small. despite the boom there were last losses.
Will the British government overcome Brexit law?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains covered about whether he is looking for possibilities for a removal of the last parliament adopted law against an unregulated Brexit. on a similar question he said to journalists on Friday only that his government will adhere to the current law.
The law provides that the government must request a delay of the date of withdrawal if no agreement with the EU has been reached until mid-October.Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday the assumption that Johnson could try to use "political scams" to overcome the law.
Johnson said he sought an agreement with the European Union. ”We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement.”
Iran to increase uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani increased pressure on the European contractual partners in the struggle on the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show disability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference at the UN Plenary Assembly in New York.
The background is the conflict about the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The U.S. left the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a rate change in the aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder requirements and now again put on harder sanctions against Tehran. Iran last responded to it with a rebound of the agreement-limited uranium enrichment.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing for use the centrifuges installed in early September.
Per the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore leave the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of U.S. sanctions, said Rohani.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's dispute in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the mixage has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the UK followed on Monday the U.S. assessment that Tehran is responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen had known about the attack, which was, however, considered a false promise by the U.S. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations have to provide evidence for it," Rohani said, "but the European leaders had not been able to do so in the talks with him during the UN general debate, instead they would have only applied that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out such an attack.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the U.S. administration should first be repealed, Rouhani called for the government in Washington to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of another star crossed through the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the space. this was first done before. the comet makes conclusions on other solar systems.
What was at first only a assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was buried on 2I/Borisov after its discovery and has raised the interest of astronomers around the world.
The long-distance comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object that has been observed during a flight through our solar system.
The first observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary. “The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which in this distance is significantly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun,” said David Farnocchia from the US Space Agency NASA in a statement.
According to the analysis, the comet is on a so-called hyperblue rail that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and classification of heavenly bodies. In honor of its discovery, the interstellar dark star, which was first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the name 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the flight. So the researchers have many months to investigate. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then will be seen by medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained.
A team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first study determined the diameter of the sky object to 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar dark star that provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. “The spectrum of this object is similar to the comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar,” IAC researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU estimates, that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such stack visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly capture a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position in a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, which, according to Esa's Director of Science, Günther Hasinger, is intended to either lay on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on the new mega airport of Daxing in Beijing
Right before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so: On the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger plane of China United Airlines landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers will be transported annually to the new airport, and by 2025 it will already be 72 million.China President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-cost project.China's latest prestigious project is also called "Sea Easter" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing trains, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new sub-new subway transports passengers to the center of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been in construction since 2006, has been repeatedly postponed.
New aircraft to fly from London to Sydney in four and a half hours in 2030
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency dreams the UK Space Agency. it is intended to make this, for the 2030s flight in the overwhelming pace a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the U.S. broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely that," said agency chief Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for the launch, and the work is already very advanced."
A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolitan currently takes about 20 hours. As the only passenger transit aircraft so far, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its operation was stopped in 2003 and it took three to three and a half hours. In 2000 there was an accident at the launch of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 inhabitants died. Last year, the U.S. aircraft maker Lockheed Martin Pläne announced, in collaboration with the U.S. Space Agency, an U.S. transit aircraft had developed an U.S. transit aircraft, the "Galaxy Plane" has also developed such a program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed-point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes among other things on its homepage. the Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound.
Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous guests in the Ukrainian case
In the Ukrainian case of potential U.S. President's abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to detect possible untouched positions in the White House.
“I want to know who has given the information to the whistleblower,” Trump said on Thursday to staff of the U.S. mission at the United Nations in New York.The person concerned is almost a “spy” and with such people in the past have been treated “a little differently” than today.
The event was not actually public, but several U.S. media on Friday broadcasted audio screens of the speech. Democrats reacted angry to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives announced preparations for an investigation against Trump on Tuesday. their accusations were mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who raised serious accusations against Trump and his government center.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials, according to which the U.S. President "used the power of his office" to that another country would interfere in the 2020 U.S. election in his favour.
In the center of the accusations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about previous business of Bidens son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his broke from Ukrainian justice.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of disturbance with a look at the Ukrainian telephone: leading government officials had tried to keep the accurate text of the conversation under the roof. As usual, an electronic text-protocol was made. This was after the conversation on the instructions of lawyers from the White House but was removed from a usually intended database and instead stored in a protected system.
The New York Times it should be an employee of the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" has spread second-hand information that would have proved untrue.
As Trump spoke in New York about those who were supposed to have spelled the information to the whistleblower, it was exciting.The president of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted anxiously and complained that Trump's statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and its surroundings for months in various committees.Given the accusations on Ukraine, the Democrats are now pursuing investigations with new motivation to launch a possible investigation proceedings against Trump.
“The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation,” said the head of the Secret Service Committee at the House of Representatives, Adam Shiff. Trump sharply attacked the ship, threw him a false picture of the things and again demanded the committee chairman’s resignation.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sector, mostly working among democratic but also among Republican presidents, stood behind a Friday-published statement behind the democratic investigation of a possible prosecution.
There is no precise schedule for the further proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could endeavour a so-called Impeachment procedure. The decision on a real withdrawal fell but in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for the success of such proceedings are therefore low. Until now, no U.S. president has been dismissed by an Impeachment procedure of the office.
VW Operating Council: Jobs will be “greatly reduced”
The plans of the brand to further decrease the cost of production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern turns down the autobauer’s operating council. The brand wants to decrease its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and the Operating Council in 2016 already predicts the decrease of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be reduced in the automotive manufacturer if quasi is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary.
As our newspaper now learned from operating rate cycles, however, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are “shakenly” decreased by another way – that is, the official course passes.
In these cases, the operating council has no way to force the recruitment. Now, in many places, the staff is lacking, the work compromises, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle works would be greater. Thus also grows the fear that the vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more affordable in other parts of the world. From VW it said only: "A adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve."
The brand VW wants to further standardize production worldwide and centrally manage new projects. also this will reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - behind it is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. production chief Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Only in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the U.S. and China, we are well advised to make us resistant to the crisis."
In this way there are already successes: For example, this year for the first time since 2013 the cost of production per vehicle will decrease compared to the previous year.Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which is scheduled to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be shortened by 1.1 hours.
for 20 hours.
In our region, the Stammwerk Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg internal the faust rule applies that there annually 800,000 cars must be built so that the factory is satisfyingly profitable. 2018 the expense in Wolfsburg was but only about 700,000 vehicles - conditioned by the decreasing diesel demand and the problems in the transition to the new consumption and gas testing process WLTP.
As the production board Tostmann has already announced last year, in Wolfsburg, however, one million cars are expected to roll out of the band. This is intended to make it possible to combine the golf production in the primary factory - because the Zwickau factory through the rearmament to the site for the e-car production gives the golf production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently evolved slowly. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Golf 8. He will, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility, remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburgers.
Voodoo forced to prostitute: human traffickers condemned
Nigeria’s young women have been trapped in the Ruhr area and forced to prostitute and six suspected human traffickers have been sentenced to prison.
Six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to proof and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months.The accused had thrown young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr region and forced them to prostitute.To force their obedience, the exile-willed Nigerian women had to make a ritual complaint before a Voodoo priest in their home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old.They were brought through the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan slides in slideship boats.The dream of a better future was not fulfilled.They arrived in Germany, they were distributed on various bordels to pay the alleged slideship costs of an average of 25,000 euros.The salary was therefore completely cut to them.
The accused – four men and two women – had confessed the intrusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on the bordel in the trial. “The work made women physically and psychically difficult to do,” Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the judgment.
The judgments were based on commercial and binding interference of foreigners, human trafficking, taxation and severe forced prosecution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
During a long dispute with the Lufthansa group, the Ufo flight association has again threatened with strike.
If the company doesn’t return to the negotiation table, the trade union will “inform on October 14 about the work struggle measures in the LH Group,” UFO Tariff Board Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct tariff negotiations with UFO for months.
At this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to find that the tariff agreements were not terminated. the court rejected the requests. the company confirmed the decision and is considering to appeal against it. “that a second court sees the case completely different, I think it is unlikely,” Ufo’s chairman Flohr said.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted a request to the Frankfurt Landesarbeitsgericht to allow the status of the UFO as a trade union to be reviewed by court.The company argues that the trade union has not employed a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfill its role as a tariff partner.
A violent leadership dispute was anticipated in the Sparta trade union, during which numerous members of the board and the council have withdrew, including the long-term trade union chief Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had, due to the doubts about its leadership, suspended an already begun Urab vote on the strikes of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not just known as an international tourist magnet. But that is now expected to change. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. by 2030 it wants to increase the payments of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a unhistoric moment for our country,” said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible to tourists so far. Visa is usually granted only for short business trips, religious trips or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the conservative kingdom hopes more income from tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In the middle of September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkhaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, the national oil production dropped drastically, the oil prices dropped up. It is expected to take several weeks until the kingdom’s oil production reaching its old level.

Half of European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to the damages, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable trees and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Nature Conservation Union (IUCN) on Friday in Brussels. it has studied the stocks of all 454 known trees in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from “potentially endangered” to “danged”, “seriously endangered”, “danged by extinction” and “extinct in nature” to “dead”.
Eberic and wild rosskastanie threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is mostly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. “Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats.”
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary roses. They have been regarded as "dangerous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is, in addition to a fungus, the Balkan mining mouth. It has spread since the 1980s from Southeast Europe across the continent and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild roses (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and isolates.
Vegetables and Moose are also in danger.
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for milk animals, strawberries and mouses. More than a fifth of milk animals and mouses and almost half of all strawberries are threatened, according to the IUCN. This lies primarily in the destruction of wildlife, injected species, agricultural practices and climate change. Milk animals such as snake played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
“This report shows that the situation for many overlooked and underestimated species is precarious, species that form the backdrop of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, Director of the IUCN Office of Europe.

According to a press release, some banks are likely to be expensive for travel provider Thomas Cook’s pledge.They are threatening high coverage on existing bonds and loans.The Credit Suisse is also affected, the Financial Times writes in its Friday edition.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would likely have to make a total deposit of up to £1.8 billion on their books, according to the report.

US warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big,” Pai told the “Trading Journal” looking at the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisprudence" to follow the instructions of security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests,” the FCC chief continues. this makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to request a "confidence declaration" from suppliers.
Berlin will initially try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" with reference to its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology consists not only of hardware:
This software consists of billions of lines of program code that changes over time,” Pai said.
It’s “very difficult to imagine” that a government authority, “wherever, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks,” the FCC chief continued.
The Chinese company Huawei has made close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus.
The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. is presented by findings according to which government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the position of the U.S.

French Finance Minister: “Germany must invest now”
French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has urged Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest now, the earlier the better," Le Maire said on Thursday night in the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the Eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We should not wait until the economic situation is worsening to make the necessary decisions.”

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson lacks the question of Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson has criticized the parliament’s “capitulation law”.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a hole.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains covered about whether he wants to pursue an unregulated Brexit - despite the last legislation adopted by the parliament, which is exactly what to prevent.
The law provides that the government must apply for a delay of the date of withdrawal if no agreement with the EU has been reached until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the assumption that Johnson could try to use "political shikans" to overcome the law. Prime Minister could put on a procedural trick to postpone the law into force to the time after leaving the EU. Johnson said he sought to a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings said he felt the political debate about Brexit as a "walk in the park" and showed himself confident that the sought out of the EU will still come: "We will enjoy that, we will win, we will leave the EU, no worry," Cummings said to the British newspaper Telegraph in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign “Vote Leave” during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now working as a chief strategist at the British government headquarters Downing Street.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Bags) is deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the photo band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the middle of September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrated guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders' frontwife Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch Event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flirting look into the life of an exceptional family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found for photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of them are now first published in The Polaroid Diaries.
There are portraits, stilllife, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his prejudice.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in the bathroom with a bag on his head or wears unformed moonboots. Certainly, the McCartneys were an exceptional family, but beyond the brightness on their farm in South England or in Scotland he also lived a very normal life. So Mary McCartney said according to the BBC that she would have slept as a baby in a bed that her father had busted out of old potato boxes. And clearly it has not always been with the McCartneys.
As hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The images of Linda McCartney are a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure shoots.
It’s about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to kick it at the exact right moment,” Paul McCartney said. “If you kick two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.” And Linda would have had the gift to always catch the right moment. “She just knew she had it,” Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the picture and the colors are true, which makes The Polaroid Diaries not only a fun picture book for the Beatles fans, but in addition to all the anecdotal, it is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also sometimes appear as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.
Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighboring country despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey had trouble importing Iranian oil because some companies had "rejected because of the U.S. threats".
However, Turkey will “continue our relations with Iran especially in this and many other matters,” the Turkish president said, who has repeatedly criticized the U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the U.S. has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran.The tensions in the Gulf region have significantly worsened in the past months.
U.S. government wants to restrict refugee reception
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday that the annual threshold of a resettlement program is expected to be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said the United States would continue to see its commitment to support refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are therefore in danger, according to the Foreign Ministry's statement.
In the 1980 program, refugees from UN camps are selected around the world and resettled in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current upper limit of 30,000 is a deepest. When the predecessor of U.S. President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was about 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - legal and illegal - the U.S. government, according to its own data, expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next budget year.
Donald Trump: “I’m going to get close to a top”
U.S. President Donald Trump has visited indicators in the Whistleblower case of espionage. Anyone who has provided the corresponding indications to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power "will get closer to a peak," Trump said according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York.
When asked for the person who informed the whistleblower about the controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This comes close to a peak."Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart?
The observers evaluated the latter comment on a possible reference to the death penalty.The Democrats exercised sharp criticism of Trump’s statements and threatened witnesses to him.It is also an attempt to prevent a Congress investigation on a possible prosecution against him, the chairs of the committees for foreign affairs, intelligence and supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
In a now-published complaint, the whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to ask for an interference of another country in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it is about his controversial telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump made him close to initiating investigations against his potential democratic challenge Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower itself and its informants are.As the New York Times reports, however, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.

A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who has found a close end due to a foolishness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it still works."

Rental suddenly suspended: WeWork makes real estate markets tremendous
In New York, WeWork has risen to be the largest office officer.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of office rental WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world’s largest real estate markets. The company had a few days ago resigned founder Adam Neumann as chief, postponed the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet to the managers to gain financial barriers for the coming weeks and months. In addition, among other things, the British “Financial Times” reports, WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest rentals of office areas are suddenly out of the market.
WeWork long-termly leases large office spaces and short-termly leases them in some small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or whole departments of large corporations. So far WeWork has burned money with this business at an amazing speed. Last year, the company caused a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the lease costs by leaseing new large spaces will have increased to an estimated $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new corporate management will now have pulled the emergency brake and the lease new flows have stopped with such an immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with a duration of up to 15 years, resulting in obligations of more than $40 billion. These huge obligations could be a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for the entire real estate markets.
According to the calculations of the economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented about 300,000 square meters of office area in the last 24 months. Only WeWork’s new contracts have made the demand for offices in New York greater than the newly marketed areas in that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, office clearance in the U.S. metropolis would have risen at that time, as Alpert wrote in “Business Insider”.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeable without further expansion of the aggressive startup. among other things, WeWork is the headquarters, in an office house in the center of the financial metropole, which last year was purchased by the deposit fund provider Deka for 100 million euros.
If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners will have to pay off some of the expected billion revenue. access to the - anyway short - reserves of WeWork they do not have, despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual sites of WeWork is usually done by each extra-founded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the mother company lies only in narrow boundaries.

In addition, the networks would simply be dismantled in the sea, where they took 200 years to be destroyed.
In the arrestations last week, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian coastal guard were injured. a North Korean also injured later died from his injuries according to the FSB. on that 17th September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second after that had opened the fire.
U.S. ban entrance to former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed entrance ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children.The U.S. Foreign Ministry justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castros' involvement in "great human rights violations."As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he stands for a system in which thousands of Cuban people will be arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As the head of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also committed to human rights violations by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. ”The denial of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the continuing crises on Cuba and Venezuela,” U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo tweeted.

This time, according to a list of the movement, protests are planned in at least 65 cities. Including in metropolities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westland on Sylt people want to go on the street for the climate.
At the age of 15 Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country for a stronger commitment to climate protection. From this, within a short time, the Fridays-for-Future movement has emerged. The climate protests involve mainly students and students, but increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from the policy in the fight against the global warming and the threatening climate disaster. above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming should be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea racing. there she had last participated in climate protests and UN summits. on Monday she held an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke intriguously to the heads of state and government of the earth. in her home Stockholm she was awarded on Wednesday for her efforts for more climate protection the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia ban smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony.This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry said Thursday in Moscow, according to the agency TASS.
Whoever smokes, therefore, has to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should dissolve a fire, then the penalty falls higher. Under the ban falls the same burning candles according to the ministry.
Cybercriminal attacks: Investigators lift out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators for the first time launched a large server provider for illegal transactions on the Darknet.
A total of 13 criminals are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on Mosel, operating their works through international criminals.
This was by the Prosecutor's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night during a large action. The Darknet is a hidden part of the Internet.
The clients of the suspects were among other things the operators of the world’s second-largest Darknet drug market, “Wall Street Market”, which had been broken by investigators in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker, according to the Prosecutor’s Office.
Such a host has been picked up for the first time in Germany, it said. a web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 has conducted investigations in Germany and abroad. it has been the result of five years of investigations.
New global climate protests on Friday for Future
A week after the world’s biggest climate protests, thousands of people will go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate crisis week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolis such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westland on Sylt.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's background men?
The sense of righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat the climate. so surprising that just a 16-year-old girl holds the mirror in front of the power man of this time. But what is behind it? Is it help willingness or wise marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man creates an assembly of children and youths to win for himself. already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt selected to engage for a fairer world. At that time he has also been able to win a lot of young people for himself and this persuades them to cross the sea to get into the promised country, like Greta Thunberg has recently made himself on a journey to America with a seat boat.
But there is a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need an action called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR manager on her side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has sold itself widely, thanks to the daughter who stands in the light of the rope. Also old-fledged followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disturbed about the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably too thick for some followers. This is also not unfounded, because the action came to the world media very well and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now divided: is it morally right to get financially rich when saving the world? is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock brokers during the World Rescue Action? no matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically characterized society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions.
Comet discovered: interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet crosses our solar system.
Astronomers’ assumptions have confirmed that a stranger comet is cruising our solar system at the moment – it’s only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov on Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope around heaven and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It’s actually an unknown comet that doesn’t come from our solar system. It’s only the second of its kind that was seen during the passage.
The great chance for astronomers is now to get close insights into a strange solar system. Obviously the coming is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary reports. The comet is clearly interstellar origin according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperblue rail that leads it out of our system.
The comet has been seen before landing - and can be observed for several months.
In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his flight, which means that it can be investigated from Earth for many months. “The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then will be seen by medium-sized telescopes until April 2020,” explains Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. space agency NASA.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at a diameter of 2 to 16 kilometers. At the same time, the heavenly body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the dark star is similar to us. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, supplemented de Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly engaging the researchers. just recently a giant asteroid passed through the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely rebellious": Rachel Johnson disappointed about his brother
First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister clearly speaks the prime minister’s war language as “smackless.”
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arms up - at least verbal. At the sub-house questioning on Wednesday, it hit massive opposition enthusiasm, and now more critics have to speak: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal should be "hanged, lengthy, wrapped, grew and fade". she thinks that is extremely rebellious. she does not recognize the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnson, who had joined the EU parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
In particular, she noticed that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, a EU-friendly subsidiary who was murdered by a neonazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. Their memories can be best honored by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the subsidiary. “It’s very unpleasant to refer to a subsidiary who was murdered by someone who called ‘Britain’ first,” now Johnson’s sister criticized.
Cox's witch also criticized the prime minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jos's name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor it is if you are passionate and determined for what you believe - no matter what opinion you are. But you should never "demonize the other side." he also complained that an atmosphere has emerged in which attacks have become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had placed his post as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory's deputy. "I've been broken between loyalty to the family and national interest in the past months - it's an unresolved tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
As the Times reports, all 118 Bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is "not worthy of this country" in a joint statement they explained: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the parliament, has not been acceptable.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez in Super Bowl
The NFL puts a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the semi-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latin roots appear, promising "a explosion of fun and energy."
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time show at the upcoming final of the U.S. Football League NFL.
“I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latin community alongside JLo because it has an incredible strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis on the southern edge of Florida many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a port-ricanic origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on the stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said. this sends an important message to all Americans and the world. she promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is from November in the drama "Hustlers" to be seen in German cinemas.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a Telenovela and singer. her global breakthrough she made in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the semi-time guests is expected in the United States every time with tension. This year many value the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a giant advertising spectacle. musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have caused furor there.
The reason was the dispute about the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise as a protest against police violence against the Black, while playing the national hymn and for it was hard treated, among other things, by U.S. President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepernick some musicians had rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 appeared, was eventually criticized by many.
A actor and youtuber puts Egypt's rulers up: for now Mohamed Ali is preferred to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether the streets of Egypt are flowing again have spent the past week both abroad. One of the two dropped again on Friday at the airport of Cairo. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who defeated the 2013 Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against the political Islam and lost no silver over the violations of human rights in the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had warned it against the President Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against the political Islam and had lost no silver over the violations of human rights in the Nile.
Lead to the mistake - this is trying, according to the president of the other man, who is currently determining what happens on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he escapes the access of security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the toning voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, living rooms and tea tables of the country: With his YouTube channel "Mohammed's Secrets" Ali calls on his peoples to rise against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people hung, swing the president in luxury and let themselves build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi runs his rule, predicts Ali corruption and enrichment. Because in his second job as a construction entrepreneur for 15 years he did business with exactly these gentlemen, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least this is the impression of many Egyptians, as the just exploding click numbers show.
After last week thousands had demonstrated against his rule for the first time since Sisi's grip after power and 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million March" for this Friday. That really so many people would dare to go on the streets was unlikely. But there came to uncovered smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo as well as in the town of China near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants Al-Sisi warned corruption and demanded his departure.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where protesters cut banners with the portrait of the president in pieces last week, massive police presence was on Friday. security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outbreak streets. in Cairo several metro stations were closed in the city centre due to "rehabilitation work", most streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which the 2013 supporters of the destroyed Muslim Brother Mursi dispersed until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, one other measure should prevent the unpaid: the future party wanted to hold out a big deal for the president here.
Mohamed Ali caused these precautions to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not collide with police officers."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than the provider suggests, there are different testing options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed details of the providers. customers can, in case of notice, check themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore be achieved, the consumer center of Bavaria explains.
If the connection always seems much slower than the provider suggests, there are different testing options. Thus, the Messtools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measures the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
“The testing of the providers, however, is carried out according to the specific requirements of the provider and is therefore not uniform and objectively calculated,” the consumer center of Bavaria says on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to perform the promised service.
If this does not affect even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also demand compensation.
First high-ranking Republicans for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, Vermont Governor has spoke for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here, is determined by the facts that will be found," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. he wants to know more about the whistleblower case before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the president's resignation - are taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the interventions of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far resigned with criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower case; few have revealed discomfort for that. Scott's statements are a first sign of it in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly turned against Trump's policy, for example, against the lock of environmental regulations and the strengthened immigration regulations.

A baby and four other children drowned in a boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned at the end of a refugee boat in the Egean region. In total, seven people were killed in the crash, the Greek coastal guard on Friday.
The boat dropped near the Greek island of Inousses, which is between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Egean region. last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Aid Agency (UNHCR).
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner, he wants to “inform Turkey about the situation of refugees,” Seehofer said on Friday.
A spokesman for the EU Commission on Friday confirmed Seehofers’ planned trip with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Only on Tuesday 654 people moved to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal work?
The increased numbers lastly raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016. This provides for the EU to be able to return all refugees and migrants who come illegally through Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to accommodate a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every displaced Syrian.
The processing of the asylum applications, however, is due to the lack of staff on the Greek side only hard forward. On Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos Hirai, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, 29,400 people are out. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with a capacity for 650 people are currently accommodated 5200 migrants.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016 there have been so many, the state round radio.

Green politician has to be charged for scary photographs
The chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was for this reason the cups manipulated?
The Canadian Green boss holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and ultimately it has been noticed. The reuseable coffee cup with metal strohhalm has never been held in hand by Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already previously published and was also spread to the media - and there was the cup still a brown (papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post.
The Green Man has to take responsibility for photopane.
The National Post then threatened May to manipulate and that the party produces fake news to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection" and that in the middle of a sub-house election campaign, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a corruption scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and focused on the discussion about fake news.A user shares a counterview of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their one-way bears."
May appeared shocked and spoke on her blog that she had nothing to know about this action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in the hand. The one, however, put her right, was from bamboo. She always had it. A party spokesman said it was just about placing the partyogo in the picture, and not hiding something. From the photo on the site is only a section to see.
“I don’t want to call him foolish, but there was nothing to hide,” she tells the Guardian and also asks something from her overwhelmed team: “If they’re looking to edit a picture again, they can’t do anything with my face so that I look younger?”
Also the German Greens have fallen in shitstorms because of their use of one-way plastic or because of flight trips - their pictures were not photoshoppt. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, eaten ice with plastic cups during the holiday, as merkur.de.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: lifelong flight prohibition at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was to have been insured an upgrade by Mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade to the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a shift from the Economy Class for free.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: an influencer declared himself actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. on Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. on May 30 she flew from Taiwan to New York and on June 7 she returned.
At the departure, the employees refused an upgrade, although they showed a mail in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly planned an upgrade. The letter intends to have received the influencer from an airline marketing staff. The airline, however, accuses Jaqueline of having falsified the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-range flight. This time, the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hunted at the center. And in fact, the employee, from which the mail allegedly came, was supposed to have dismissed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. for $1,400 (around €1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had returned her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost for the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not enter the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline's business conditions also indicate that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy it - and now calls a lawyer.
Oil prices rise according to a report on a ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen says Saudi Arabia has approved a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had lost five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia makes Iran responsible as the U.S. government. A cessation of weapons would aggravate political tensions in the region.
If an agreement really comes into effect, we can focus on growth and demand issues, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw materials strategy department at Saxo Bank, news agency Bloomberg.
One week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost $59 and Brent $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg, referring to Insider, that repairs on oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September advanced faster than expected.
Lastly, there were several press releases with reference to insiders reporting the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repairs, but raw materials experts point to that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock exchange and wants to avoid negative signals.
At the same time there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and the western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the fixation by Iran and the recently granted release is on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing for the departure while the ship is still ahead of the anchor, Reedereichef Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the U.S. announced the shipping of defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the UK had temporarily increased oil prices in the past weeks.
Accusations against Trump are increasing
In the case of potential abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, fraud accusations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have been intense efforts to prevent access to the text of the talks after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This was stated by an anonymous indicator. The spokeswoman of the House of Representatives, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, clearly threw the White House "fraud".
North Korea says Trump and Kim's third summit is controversial
North Korea has raised doubts that it will soon come to a third summit of powerholders Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in the implementation of the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the summit decisions last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said, he also criticized severe U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuver of the U.S. and South Korea.
Trump said on Monday he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he prepared for that. negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have gone down since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. in June the two then met in the de-militarized zone between the two Korean states.
Prince Harry: Weapons Manufacturers Will Help Mining
Britain's prince Harry, dressed in a blue split protective wall, symbolically burned and destroyed an explosion mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he set the fire circle. In a secure distance the explosive body exploded. Looking at the goal of getting Angola free of mine by 2025, he later appealed to the current TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who did not help in the departure, to commit to help."
Pounds under pressure – interest rates are expected
British pounds under pressure
In the light of a rapid interest rate decline, the pound loses its value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a soon falling interest rate by the Bank of England (BoE) add to the pound sterling. the British currency dropped up to 0.4 percent on Friday to $1.2269.
The promoters of the sales were statements by the note banker Michael Saunders. This brought a interest rate reduction to the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be eliminated, since uncertainty will affect the UK economy in a predictable time. This statement is surprising, since Saunders was considered a defendant of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the broker house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already noticed the burden on the economy due to the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a interest rate decline. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country, if necessary, even without a divorce agreement, out of the EU on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian Manipulations Proved
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and today's head of integrity of the Light Athletics World Federation.
At the start of the Light Athletics World Cup, new details about the doping scandal in Russia appear - and they destroy the few of the credibility that the Russian sport had gained back at the beginning of the year and even only practically. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, a systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. The Wada had blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, allowed about 270 athletes of the country to participate under neutral flag, at the 2018 Winter Games in February, 168 Russian athletes were at the start.
Lack of positive findings
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada band again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the mentioned samples. The data should provide evidence of the extent of the dumping of doping cases during state doping. They should help punish athletes subsequently. Three months later they were finally delivered.
But the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. we should check whether the Task Force has received the right data," David Howman said in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that it received from the Russians in January."
The World Cup is not affected
This is confirmed by the IAAF’s attitude: The Light Athletics Federation holds it as the only organization on the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put manipulations into the room and urged Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks.Russia now threatens to re-block the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
