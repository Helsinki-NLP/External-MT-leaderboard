AMs in Wales were worried about 'looking like stupid people'.
There was a fear among some AMs at a proposal that their status should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It was born out of plans to rename the Welsh Assembly.
AM's political audience was worried that it might be called a joke.
One worker from the AM party said his team was concerned about "its sequence with Twp and Pwp".
For the outside audience from Wales: in Welsh, twp means "scum" and pwp means "dirty".
An AM member wearing a fur coat said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh moderate said their group was "open minded" about the name change, but it was identified as a short verbal leap from the MWP to make us look stupid.
In this context, the Welsh w is pronounced as the Yorkshire English u.
The Meeting Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision of any descriptor addressing the members of the Meeting is indeed a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised members to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling for a Welsh Parliament for the meeting.
On the issue of the position of AMs, the Commission preferred to have Welsh MPs or WMPs, although the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternatives, but efforts to reach an agreement with the head of the agency, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft of the amendments in a few weeks, could be a headache.
The reform regulations will include rules on the incompetence of AMs and other changes to the way the meeting operates, including the composition of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on what to call them when they debate legislation.
Macedonians are about to vote in a referendum on changing their country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece over Macedonia's statehood.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgy Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Soron Sow, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
While churches in Harlem struggle, bells in St. Martin's are silent.
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church at every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, none of them".
He said the bar could be seen disappearing.
"People are sociable in different ways", he said.
"Bars are no longer the low-rise living rooms where people go regularly".
Regarding churches, he regrets that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders hope, and that "sooner or later they will return to where they started".
He added that the churches that remained in the basement could be replaced by apartment buildings with multi-storey apartment complexes filled with unsupported people.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartment complexes in these buildings will be white", he said, "so the day will soon come when all these churches will close together because people who move into these apartment complexes cannot be expected to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by the white religious community before Harlem became a black city - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The first white Methodist church was dissolved in 1930.
The black religious congregation, which was worshiping nearby, took over the building.
The Black Religious Council, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major street in Harlem that prevented black people from hiring or promoting, and the Black Church seized ownership of St. Martin's.
In 1939 a fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's benefactors developed plans to rebuild it, and they put the bell in operation.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor".
In July, an expert on the gong described it as something different: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany A. J., a specialist at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the world's first bell played by Dionysius A. Lind, a black musician who had moved to the largest church bell 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's had no replacement.
What has played out at St. Martin's over the past few months, some by amateur church leaders, others by the bishops' hierarchy, has been a complex myth of architects and contractors.
The vestry - that is, the governing body of the contributors - made up of amateur leaders wrote to the bishop in July, expressing concern that the bishop was "looking to impose a cost" on the vestry, even though the bishop was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some donors complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the Crown.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy who is diving for lobsters in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy in California during the opening days of the shark-fishing season while he was diving for shark-fishing.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in Santiago that he was diving for about an hour and a half with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then ran with a team to get him out of the water.
"I was so excited to see him", says Hamel, "that I thought he was just a little bit of a thrill-seeker, but then I realized that he was screaming, 'Bite me!'
I was bitten!
When he approached the boy, Hamel said, his entire vertebra was torn open and his neck was fractured.
"I shouted out, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in Santiago, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles had reported a shark's skull at a press conference a few weeks earlier, but had decided it was not a dangerous species.
Gilles added that the victim's upper torso was severely injured by the shock.
Officials are closing the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the master in Escinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
The report states that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans will boost the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's supermarket chain, staffed by professional assistants, takes over the mall-style boutique including the iconic Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a bid to give a significant boost to the growing beauty market of US$2.8bn amid falling fashion and furniture sales, 11 large beauty outlets across the country will be tested, including Ikea, and if successful, more will open next year.
Cosmetics's proposal comes as supermarkets track down ways to use floor space for TVs, microwaves and furniture.
Sainsbury's said it would double its current range of cosmetics to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, Dr. PawPaw and more.
L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with brands that are similar to existing ranges, from those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its store layout to make more products vegetarian-friendly, something that is increasingly demanded by young shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing discounted sales at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London and the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying a few meals a day from a local convenience store means that people will have to do more for supermarkets to keep them coming to their stores.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coope said that the supermarket chain will look more like a shopping mall as it tries to compete against discount agencies such as Aldi and Lidlhas with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's, which bought both chains two years ago, has hundreds of stores selling Argos, and has also introduced a number of Habitats, which it says will help retailers make acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to modernize its cosmetics and pharmacy stores failed.
Sainsbury's had tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the company was wound up after a dispute over how its supermarkets would share revenue from drug stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for £125 million to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds said that an extension of the luxury leather range with La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands would be used to implement the design.
Paul Mills Hicks, marketing director at Sainsbury's supermarket chain, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our aisles, including our image, to improve the environment for our customers.
Specialised trained assistants are also invested to provide guidance.
Our brand is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an iconic destination for Parisian consumers who now challenge the old-fashioned way of shopping".
Peter Jones was furious when Holly Willoughby withdrew a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has been angered after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wilooby really doesn't have time for their furniture and furniture brand.
The couple's business was connected to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning news anchor used her Instagram account to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby's last-minute exit from the Dragons' Den star Peter Jones's lifestyle brand campaign has sparked outrage - to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when Jones told her during an exciting meeting with the TV golden girl at his corporate empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she really had no time to devote to their furniture and furniture brands due to new deals worth up to A$1.5 million, sources said.
The campaign was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to have doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11.
Willoughby, 37, took to her Instagram account to announce that she had indeed left, and Jones left Britain on a jet to go to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "A lot of it was definitely Holly's top priority.
It was her long-term future that would see her through the next two centuries.
Her decision to withdraw was a complete shock to all involved.
As it was so close to launch, no one could believe what was happening on Tuesday.
"There is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at Marlow HQ".
Experts believe the departure of the morning news presenter, who is one of Britain's top money-making stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to massive investment in a range of products from mattresses and candles to textiles and furniture, and could further delay its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin Jones, have been in a close relationship with his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple is on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production.
Willoughby was to be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartyn as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
After a serious discussion, we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a statement that some would consider unkind to the president and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so backward?
Trump shouted to his funny "newscaster".
"I have left nothing behind".
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump sees as a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the nuclear talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ryeong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "response" from the United States to the previous move to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued to impose sanctions in an effort to maintain pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the meeting.
"We are doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were preparing for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have this wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and bringing back the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach when it came to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to get into these crowded theaters, we're keeping 200 here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of him.
An Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake disaster, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lombok's population being displaced, no national disaster was declared to prompt calls for international assistance.
"In most cases, unfortunately, it is very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", said Sumbung Mu.
Save the Children is deploying a team to Palo, and it is not yet clear if the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Indonesian officials are reaching out to Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort, said National Disaster Agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo.
Given the constant earthquakes Indonesia experiences, the country's preparedness for the natural disaster is at a tragically low level.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not common on other coastal areas.
Despite a tsunami warning, the absence of tsunami warning bells in Palu could cause loss of life.
In most seasons, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters complicate the transportation of cargo.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new tragedy.
Improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure has been a focus of presidential campaign by Joko Widodo, who has also invested in highways and railways.
But as Mr. Joko faces re-election next year, his administration is being hit by a lack of funding.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embrace the more traditional form of faith.
Street fighting by Christian and Muslim gangs using sharp weapons, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons killed more than 1,000 people and displaced tens of thousands.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool, who has been linked with a move to the Championship, has been linked with a move to the Championship.
In the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge scored against Chelsea and saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat.
His team was 1-0 down, and Sturridge was given the ball from Sheldon Shakiri, 30 yards from Chelsea's goal.
He tapped the ball to his left before striking the pole.
As it moved toward the upper right corner of the net, the effort passed over the box.
The ball finally fell over a jump by Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the net.
"It's just trying to get to that spot to get the ball and because players like Shark always play it as far forward as possible, I tried to create as much time as possible myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"Kante came forward and saw one of the decks falling, but he hit it without thinking".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the semi-final after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker returned an offer to Matteo Kovacic in the same round of games before spinning to Liverpool's half, spinning near the midfield.
Kowassic made a quick pass-and-drive in midfield.
He then led Hazard into the box, throwing a beautiful pitch.
Hazard overcame the defensive line and passed Liverpool's Alison Baker, entering the net with a left-footed shot from the post.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm in San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videotron team in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The total death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
The agency's spokesperson, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped among the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, which created waves as high as 20 feet.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered in rubble.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
She was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds on John Street in Grayson Moose, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police are asking the public to report anyone who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would ask anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us.
I urge anyone, including taxi drivers, who have anything recorded on dash cameras to contact us as they may have information relevant to our investigation.
The woman was identified as a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found in a field, a police spokesman confirmed.
Friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said that the next of kin of the victim are being informed and the investigation is ongoing.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews was trying to re-enter his apartment when no one was allowed in or out of the building, police said.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
Residents are now being told that it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard to say that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, weeping.
'It's too dangerous,' she keeps saying.
At about 2 p.m., two police vans were in the patrol area and another outside nearby.
A number of officers were stationed in the watchtower to monitor the blockade of the apartment complex.
Anyone with information can email @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crime Prevention on 0800 555 111 on September 30th, 247 and remain anonymous.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the latest memorial in the 'Rewrite History' series.
Its exile would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of much of England's cultural and religious relics by his radical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was inevitably a target in the current debate over the abolition of slavery.
Cromwell did not give or execute orders to destroy statues during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Thornycroft's stunning portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century opinion and a part of the historical record of a character many believe to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "In the late 19th century, Cromwell was seen by many as a defender of the parliamentary system, in this case the state, against outside influences.
Whether it is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century undoubtedly shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure as one of the representatives of one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are worth celebrating and commemorating".
The killer pig bites and kills the Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuanxu, was found bleeding to death from excessive bleeding near a pigsty in a market in Liuangshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm in Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He was reported to have gone to the market with a cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs from the neighboring province of Yunnan.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and a door to the adjacent pigsty was found open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with moose blood on it.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig beat the farmer to death.
"My brother-in-law's legs were bloody and bruised", said his brother-in-law, also known as Wu, as quoted by the Guiyan Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 am on Thursday.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The pig that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
Police are collecting evidence at the scene and the pig had a separate lock to prevent it from attacking anyone else, a market manager told the Evening News.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly in talks to pay compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs have been reported to attack humans.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig was driven into the tractor of a Welsh farmer by his wife, who screamed and chased the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
They're athletic.
They're cute, they're very attentive... and they don't try to hurt you.
You just have to take care of them properly", he said.
Hurricane Rosa is about to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
By 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Hurricane Rosa had become a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north by Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. Rosa will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States as it approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture interaction with the approaching basin will create a sweeping rainfall pattern that will spread southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of precipitation can also cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, reaches a rainfall rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour for the spots.
In the southwest, especially most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected.
The scattered nature of tropical rainfall can cause sudden flooding with rapidly diminishing conditions.
With the threat of tropical rain, a trek into the desert will be an extremely dangerous and unpredictable adventure.
Heavy rain can turn the dunes into muddy rivers, and thunderstorms can cause locally strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching hurricane will bring locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
More than a half inch of precipitation is possible, causing minor debris flows and slippery roads.
This is likely the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before spreading more widely on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread in four directions on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
Extreme temperature changes will be seen across the United States in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This may cause large temperature variations over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the huge temperature changes across the central United States.
There's a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the lasting summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
With the southern plains spreading into the northeast in the 80s, most of the central and eastern United States is expected to start warming by October.
New York City could hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above normal.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a higher than average temperature in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a 1980s sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, made a gripping statement Thursday that was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, Friday's last-minute incident: The political stance continued with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a deal planned by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake on behalf of the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh grabbed her drunk at a high school party and tried to steal her clothes.
Kawano testified passionately that he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people are expected to watch it on Friday.
The average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC was calculated by the company.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has some limitations on the number of people who watch in offices.
To give you an idea, it's the same size audience as a playoff game or an Academy Awards ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks in the day-long hearing with an average audience of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the trial, the interest was high.
Flake was the central character in Friday the 13th.
After the office of the moderate Republicans issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he was accused of protesting by climbing an elevator to attend a judicial committee hearing.
He was reprimanded and watched live on CNN.
"I am standing before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
"You have power when most women don't have it", he was told.
Flake said in a statement that his office had said he would have more to say at the committee hearing before the elevator was shut down.
As the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for a vote in the full Senate, cable and broadcast networks all covered it live for hours afterwards.
But Flake said he would only do so if he understood the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee for next week's nomination, which the minority Democrats are calling for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after a discussion with Kunz and a few senators.
Flake's choice was made because it was clear that the Republicans would not vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing a "political game" over Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing a political game with Britain's future" and undermining the nation's good fortune.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party summit in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In one of her front-page interviews with the paper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely fraudulent".
Detian Simpson, suspected of killing LSU athlete, is in custody.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old DeTian Simpson was arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder.
A video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson was released by the officers, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wade.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office said in a preliminary report Friday that gunshot wounds to the head and neck were the cause of death.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police's Deployment Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for their support in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for their diligence and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team is devastated and shocked by Wade's death.
"This is what you always worry about", Wade said.
The volcano is burning Mexico City to the ground.
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the crater after it reported 183 gases and ash emissions in 24 hours due to the crater's activity.
The station was monitoring a series of collisions and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have been alerted to an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands of people joined a protest march to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede.
Masked separatist loyalists detained by riot police attacked them with eggs and threw powdered paint, creating dark dust clouds in the often crowded streets.
Later in the day, clashes broke out as police used batons to control the fight.
For more than a few hours, pro-liberal groups confronted trade union protesters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" and shouting "Let Spain last too long".
Local newspapers reported that 14 people with minor injuries were treated during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considered illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated, tensions remain high in the pro-freedom zone.
The anti-separation movement largely boycotted the vote, and despite a declining turnout, voters largely chose to remain independent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured after police tried to stop voting in violent clashes at polling stations across the region last year.
Independent-philanthropic groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The march continued but was forced to go in a different direction.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in the separatist demonstration with his wife and said he was no longer optimistic about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite managing a crucial but sharp victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to hold on to power this year as many of their popular leaders have been forced out of Typo or held in custody pending trial for organising a referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
In support of the police, 42-year-old technician Joan Puig, who was recording the protest on his phone, said the clash was caused by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Putting myself forward as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline and repression of democratic values we have seen in the Spanish parliament", he said.
London: Men arrested after crashing a house in a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being hit by a car at a house in London.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday at the Ballingrad Crescent.
Detective Bob Fleming said the damage was to the gates and the building.
The car could have been hit with a crossbow.
Menga's shot gives the Rangers a 1-0 win over the Cancers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston defended the victory.
Livingston surprised the Rangers by promoting him to manager of Ibrox for Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games.
Gary Holt's side tied with Hibernian in second place, proving Dolly Mango's shot was different.
Gerard's side remain unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face the eight-point chase Hearts on Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, who have extended their unbeaten run to six games this season, are still enjoying defeat after head coach Holt replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses his chances against the Blunt Visitors.
Their directness caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers, and Holt's team had to advance long before they scored.
Scott Robinson was successful but his effort was pulled across the ball, and later Alan Lithgow was able to steer his effort broadly after sliding across the ball to meet Craig Halcott's advance.
Knowing that their fancy style of play could make guests uncomfortable, the Rangers were content to allow the players to play in front of them.
The decisive ball was found.
The Rangers scored a free kick and Livingston opened the scoring, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in a touchdown to help the Mangas score.
By that point, the Rangers had retained their dominance but were unable to break the home court defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was often unmolested.
Despite a strong save from Alfredo Morelos Kelly, the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman's shot was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's foot, and Lithgow hit wide in another of Livingston's usual style of play.
Crossed shots continued to enter Livingston's box and were consistently blocked, with two penalty requests - one for a touchdown and one for a touchdown - abandoned after Halcott's challenge to replacement Glenn Middleton.
The "Miracle" at Livingston - An Analysis
Alessandre Lamont from the Tony MacArthur Stadium, BBC Scotland
The miraculous performance and results of Livingston.
For a human, they are the greatest of all the climbers.
Their style of play and their personalities have not changed since their return to the top, but he deserves credit for how strong the team has become since Holt's arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcott was a formidable defender with a highly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Varrell fully prepared.
However, the Rangers' spirits were low.
As good as they were under Gerard, they fell below those standards.
Their last chance was lost - they only managed to win the host cancer once - and a wake-up call for the Rangers cancer in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
The atmosphere was one of friendship and goodwill when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast on Saturday (September 29).
It was the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at renewing ties between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne to open a new big mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but large numbers of supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - protested, condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The hateful protests reflect the duality of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and denounced as an autocrat by others.
In Deptford, a motorcycle crash kills a cyclist.
A cyclist has been killed in a car crash in London.
The accident happened at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver of the car was stopped and medical personnel arrived, but he died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was hit and run over on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The municipal police said that officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and bus diversions are being implemented and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Laring Prison: Six officers disabled in chaos
The prison office said that six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison.
At 0930 BST, a state of emergency has been declared at HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire and is ongoing.
Special Tornado Officers have been called in to deal with the disturbance, which includes eight detainees from one unit.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison services spokesman said: "HMP has deployed specially trained prison staff to deal with an ongoing incident in Long Laring.
Six crew members have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible will be brought to the police and will obviously have to spend a long time in prison.
HMP Long Laring houses over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were called to the prison to quell a major riot caused by the use of pool balls against the staff.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with imminent flooding (may be good for drought-stricken areas)
Arizona is rarely in a tropical depression, but the residual strength of Hurricane Rosa, which is hurtling through the southwestern desert, posing imminent flood risks, is what is most likely to happen early next week.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern Nevada, southern Arizona, southern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The pink storm, which is expected to make landfall on Monday, is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only 10 tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the border of AZ.
With up to 6 inches of rain in Mogollon Rim, Arizona, the latest National Hurricane Center forecast predicts 2 to 4 inches of precipitation.
Other areas of the desert southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Plains, can receive 1 to 2 inches, with isolated sums of up to 4 inches.
The rainfall from Tropical Storm Rosa is a blessing to areas that are not at risk of flooding, as those areas are severely affected by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, this report will be beneficial to some areas, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Survey, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought, the second largest category, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will be directed through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, Rosa is still in the strength of a hurricane as of Sunday morning, moving 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour north.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, and thus its force is diminished.
So, landslides are expected in Mexico late Monday or late afternoon in the form of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall may occur in some parts of Mexico, causing significant flooding.
Rainfall is expected to be between 3 and 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will then move through Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, before moving through Arizona late Tuesday night and into southern Utah.
"The main danger that can be expected from Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is extremely heavy rainfall in the northwest portion of Baja California and the desert of the southwestern United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to cause immediate flooding and desertification and landslides in mountainous areas that can cause loss of life.
Four attempted murderers arrested in the middle of summer.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with multiple gunshot wounds on the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Redstock area.
Officials are asking anyone with cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh's Democratic Party is "sad, humiliated, angry".
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and unethical tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has endured the wrath and indignation of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, quickly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually abused her as a teenager decades ago.
Ford also testified at her trial.
From Kavanaugh: "The American people have seen the brilliance, the quality and the courage of the people", the president said on Saturday.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm a lawyer with one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, with an outstanding record in public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
Speaking of the importance of voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
I didn't run, but I really did run, he said.
"That's why I fight for the best candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and disruption".
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held on or before Friday.
The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami have killed hundreds and are expected to increase in size.
At least 384 people were killed when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and many more were washed up as giant waves washed up on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
As hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday, a six-metre (18-foot) high wave slammed into the beach in the evening, killing many and destroying everything in sight.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the coast without evacuating immediately and they became victims", said Sutopo Parwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, at a conference in Jakarta.
Noting that the tsunami was moving through the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast, Nugroho said: "The tsunami did not come alone, it washed away cars, flags, houses and it hit everything on land".
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and a flooded mosque.
The coastal city was hit by a series of aftershocks on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Evaluation and Technology Investment Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It states that the city's geographic location at the end of a long, narrow bay would have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
The damage was "extensive", said Nugroho, with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels destroyed.
Several bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing, he said.
The number of casualties and damage could be higher on the coast in an area called Donggala, near the epicenter, 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, said Ngroho.
The communications from Donggala were "completely inoperative without any information", said Nugroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area and that its staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not notifying Palu of a tsunami, but waves arrived around the time the warning was issued, officials said.
According to an amateur video that has been circulating on social media, a man on the top floor of a building has been able to hear warnings of an approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water will break through the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the sighting immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around the bridge, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but the rescued people still need food and other basic amenities.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the detention centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision's staff arrived safely in Palu, where employees are housed in wax tents set up in their office yard, and have seen the devastated scenery on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They saw a number of destroyed houses", he said.
It's very bad.
Although relief groups have taken maximum measures to start disaster relief, some have accused highly skilled foreign aid workers of being prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can only begin to be received if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It never happened.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Olia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Okay, once the government says this is a national disaster, we can be open to international assistance, but we haven't yet".
As the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami dawns on Palu, friends and families of those still missing are waiting in anticipation that their loved ones will be the miracle that will unravel the dark circle of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in a garbage dump.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped in the rubble for two days, standing next to her mother's body.
Two paragliders who were trained by Jendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, for the Asian Games, which began earlier this year, are missing.
The others trapped in the Rova Rova Hotel are Mr. Mandagi and his students.
"As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional calm", he said.
Mr. Jenden recalled how he had been sending WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who were attending the beach festival, hours after news of the Rova Rova Hotel collapse spread among the paragliding community.
His messages resulted in a grey marker, not a pair of blue ones.
"I think the point is that the messages are not received", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport, La.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, $26,750 was stolen Friday morning from a Bronx employee who was depositing cash into an ATM in Levi, Newport.
The driver of the car was preparing to empty an ATM at the entertainment complex and add more cash, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was there, another man chased after the Brink's guard and stole a bag of money that he was supposed to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not give accurate figures, according to the statement.
Anyone with information about their identity should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Kanye West.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "The man officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was nicknamed "Y" for a time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandi.
The show's creator said he will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for emotional reasons.
West Min has previously stated that the word is of religious significance to him, as is an abbreviation for his current professional name.
"I believe the most commonly used word in the Bible is 'ye,' in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, speaking to Big Boy Radio, about the title of his album.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is about us.
It became the "I", the "I", the reflection of all of us, good, bad, complex.
This album is a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the many rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, Puff Daddy, P.D.D. or Didi, etc. were known by different names, but he preferred the names Love and Brother Love this year.
West's collaborator Jay-Z also has a name with or without a dash or capital letters.
AMLO, in Mexico, pledges not to use force against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody counter-insurgency against the students, has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Last Saturday in Plaza Tlatelolco, Lopez Obrador promised that military force would never be used to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America, the military attacked a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing some 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has promised to create a favorable environment for young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more public universities that offer free education.
He said that youth are attracted to gangs due to low unemployment and educational opportunities.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI professional who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, says that the United States should double its spending on research in this area as China shows more activity in AI.
The comments came after various US government officials announced that the US did not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China unveiled its plan: they aim to become the number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research will give a good start, as all other countries are far behind the United States, and we expect the next rapid leap forward in AI", Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that the doubling of funding would also double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will come from the United States.
Li, the author of "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Face++, the most powerful Chinese AI company, which has invested in Sinovation Ventures.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that beat top-level American player Othello, and was an executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's China division.
The previous US government welcomed technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when such a competition would be held again to identify future visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the United States would have to work hard to get government grants.
"It is not China that is taking out the smart leaders; it is companies", Li said.
Recently, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have recruited university professors to work on AI.
Changes in immigration policy would also help strengthen artificial intelligence exercises in the United States, Lee says.
I think people with PhDs in Artificial Intelligence should be given green cards automatically, he said.
China's State Council released its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Ethnomusicology funds individuals in academic institutions, in a similar way to how researchers in the United States are funded by the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li says.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will include industry partners and academics. The White House also announced the creation of an AI Selection Board.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
According to the National Science Foundation, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research related to artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, there has been no news for months about the proposed US law to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to decide whether to change the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a measure to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has been a barrier to EU and NATO membership.
Greece, with a province named Macedonia, was denied entry to NATO and the European Union, claiming that the name of its northern neighbor was the same as that of its neighbour.
The two states reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, raising doubts about whether he will be able to achieve the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid in the face of the strike measures.
The ballot paper reads: "Do you accept the agreement with Greece and express your desire to join NATO and the European Union?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Saev, argue that it is a fair price to pay for Macedonia, a state that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join institutions such as the European Union and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the younger generation of Macedonians for the future of the country, so that they can live in freedom with the EU, which will make us all safer", said Olivera Georgeevska, 79, from Skopje.
A sufficient number of MPs have said that they will look at the results of the election to decide on this, although they are not legally binding.
A two-thirds majority in the parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that as of 1 pm, no irregularities were reported.
However, the turnout so far was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent voted.
Jose Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter from Skopje, said that because the children came to vote, we should belong to Europe.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Sayev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, voted in a referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica to change Macedonia's name, opening the door for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small platform and setting up chairs in front of the tents set up by the referendum boycotters in front of the parliament in Skopje.
"We want to join NATO and the EU, but not through the back door, with our heads held high", said Kaiderkov.
We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they can't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian Alliance.
Prime Minister Sayyev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will agree with this, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Sayyev, casting his vote.
The answer, he said, was "Yes, our future will be a certainty".
A poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that the turnout in the referendum was between 30 and 43 percent, which is below the required threshold.
Another poll conducted by Thelma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 percent of respondents are ready to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
The referendum needs a turnout of 50 percent and one vote to succeed.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City moves across the goal line at Brighton to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling lost to Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute and showed it to be unusually easy.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker got the ball in the midfield.
He runs through the Brighton guards and follows them into the open.
And the angel saw himself surrounded by four green robes.
He pushed one of the guards before overtaking several of the rear guards at Brighton Castle.
Then he looked at Sterling and moved the ball to his left.
Sterling touched the box and aimed the ball back at Aguero, who defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew and directed the ball with his right foot to the right hand of the net.
Aguero suffers from a problem with his leg, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blue the first lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that match, Aguero got the ball in the middle of the field in Brighton.
Leroy passed the ball to Sunny from the left.
Sunny touched the ball several times before Sterling was sent to a distance.
Sky Blue kept the ball in the net.
On Tuesday, the Champions League match will be played between Rhein Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany and Hoffenheim.
Scherzer needs a tough game to beat the Rockies.
The Nationals have stopped fighting each other, so there was no need for another start.
But Scherzer, always competitive, is looking to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies respond by one point over the Los Angeles Dodgers of the NL West.
On Friday night, the Rockies are still fighting for the division title, despite a 5-2 win against the Nationals.
Even if we don't win this season, it's important to know the situation in Denver with the crowd, and playing with the best team can prepare us for any situation.
So there's no reason not to compete.
The National Team will make a formal announcement on Sunday, but Scherzer has reportedly been given the opportunity to comment.
Scherzer, making his 34th start, had a pre-training session on Thursday and will normally have his day off on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and has recorded 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the president indirectly commented on the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Everything we have done will be questioned in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lifetimes.
This is the biggest one we have, -- I'm not just running this, it's important because I'm looking for the best candidates", he said.
Trump goes on to say, "You see these destructive radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They're desperate to regain power, you see the lowliness, the ugliness.
They don't care who they hurt, they'll do anything to get power and control, and that's all they want, power and control, and we're not giving it to them.
The Democrats are trying to do the opposite to get us off our feet, he said.
"You've seen it over the last four days", he adds, "he calls the Democrats angry, mean, and disgusting and lying".
When he mentioned the name of a top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Diane Feinstein, the audience was in a state of shock.
"I was so happy to see her", she says.
Did you release the document?
Oh, what the hell.
No, no -- it was a really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a party that listens to everyone.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
It's no surprise that party activists in my area voted to censor me.
I've just joined the crowd who have been told that because of their opinions, they are no longer welcome in the party.
My congresswoman, John Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood up for anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship was imposed because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy has been vocal about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe and many other issues.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said: "We want to make the meetings inclusive and productive".
In my eight years as a Labour MP, the Friday committee meetings have all been like this.
Unfortunately, that is not the case today, and the promise of a more kind, more gentle politics has long been forgotten.
The intolerant nature of the diversity of views in the Labour Party was increasingly manifested and every opinion was questioned as to whether it was acceptable to the party leadership.
This began a few days after Jeremy became leader, and a man who I thought shared the same political views as my colleagues who had joined me was looking for a radical reversal of my politics and a different patriotic position, whether it was on national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I spoke in public - no matter what I said - I was attacked on social media, and I was told to resign and remain in the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the accusations and comments against me are purely political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who have faced numerous sexual or racial abuse cases but never back down.
One of the most disappointing features of this political era is the normalization of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn declared that a culture of tolerance should be created within the party.
The truth is that we are no longer a party that listens to everyone, and with every vote of no confidence or change in the electoral rules, the party narrows.
For the past two years, I've been told to keep my head down and not talk so much and everything will be okay.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, with my extensive school classroom decaying under the neglect of the Thatcher government, I have worked as a local councillor or minister of state to provide decent public services to the most disadvantaged.
I never hid my politics, not even the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever expressed a confused view of my policy positions and my disagreements with the existing leadership.
To all those who supported Friday's motion, I have to say that at a time when the country is heading for a Brexit that will damage homes, businesses and our public service, I cannot understand why I would waste so much time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth my only message is not to the Nottingham force but to my constituents, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of dismissal or political gain will stop me from working for what I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
The undefeated air to the air.
Two attempts that could have changed the outcome somewhat, but the win of this amazing Tenants Premiership match was certainly justified by the fact that it went to the AIR.
Now they're on top and the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense and good use of chances that got them to that position, and their coach Peter Murchie should be credited with that.
We have been tested in many matches but we have not lost yet, so I must be happy, he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Air has to be credited with using the opportunities better than we did".
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's position was changed by Fraser Climo and Eyre took the lead, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggett to make successful attempts.
Klimt led Eyre with five penalties and scored before halftime and converted a single attempt to make the score 17-5 at halftime.
However, Melrose started the second round well and was reduced to five points by a Patrick Anderson effort blocked by Baggett.
Then a serious accident to Ruud Knott took him to hospital, and the race was suspended for a long time, and after the resumption, Eyre continued with the effort of Stafford McDowell, who was turned by Climo.
Interim team captain Blair McPherson was then given a yellow card, where the Melrose team under great pressure thwarted Bruce Colvin's attempt.
However, when Klimho tackled the ball and Sturgeon Hutchison received a yellow card, McPherson returned the advantage to Eyre.
After the resumption of the match, Kyle Rowe took a punch from David Armstrong and thwarted Gregor Henry's attempt.
The actor of "Still Game" is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry.
"Steal Game star Ford Kieran is set to enter the hospitality industry "with the revelation that he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old, along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill, writes the popular BBC drama series and plays Jack Javis.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be its last, and Kearnan appears to be preparing for a new life after Craigslist.
He is the director of Adriftmorne, according to official records.
The Scottish Sun reported that Kearny was considering joining up with another upscale restaurant in Glasgow, but he declined to comment.
The ocean is ours: Bolivia, cut off from the mainland, hopes to reopen the road to the Pacific via the court.
The sailors visited the naval base at Lhasa.
The flags of the sea will be flown at the top of the government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval base is haunted by the motto: "The ocean is ours".
It is our responsibility to recover it.
For landlocked Bolivia, the beaches are a distant memory - the result of a bloody resource conflict with Chile in the 19th century - but they are eager to sail across the Pacific again.
Decades later, these expectations culminated in the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has the strength of unity and peace, and looks forward to a positive outcome, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kelsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, and it is expected that the tribunal in The Hague - after decades of uncertain negotiations - will do justice to Bolivia's demand that Chile must agree to negotiate a sovereign sea route to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous unpopular president, who faces a contentious re-election contest next year, is also at high risk of Monday's decision.
"He was about to sail again to the Pacific", he vowed last August.
But some analysts point out that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and that even if it did, nothing would change much.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to grant such a gift of Czech territory and cannot be held responsible for the outcome of any negotiations.
The decision of the International Court of Justice comes six months after the final hearing, which means that the case was "not a complex one", said Pas Sarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia's goal was to be solved in the last four years.
The issue of access to the sea is being addressed by the current Bolivian administration, said Sarate.
She said Morales' violent speeches had also eroded the goodwill that had been left in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will be discussing at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velázquez, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily hasty.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to enter a new era of relations with Chile, ending 139 years of disputes and bringing mutual benefits.
And, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, Morales denied that the maritime issue was being used for political gain.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean", he said.
This decision is an opportunity to put the past behind us.
North Korea says it will not be able to disarm without the US's help.
North Korean Foreign Minister Yong Ho says his country will never denuclearize unless he can trust Washington.
The following statement was made by Reyes last Saturday in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly:
He said the pledges agreed at the summit in Singapore between the two rival countries should be implemented.
He was speaking less than three months after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held a failed nuclear diplomatic meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Re says that continuing sanctions and protests against the declaration ending the Korean War are a dream if the North is to be brought to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration until significant disarmament clearance is made from Pyongyang.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump have called for a second summit.
But Pyongyang's denial of the news of the breach, which it sees as the only way to ensure the country's security, has raised considerable doubts.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion scene in Paris suggests that you bring a big, naked dress nearby.
If you want to increase your hat collection or block out the sun completely, now is your chance.
Valentino and Tom Brown had added a crazy-sized sleeveless headscarf to their SS19 collection, which was a hit at Paris Fashion Week.
The ultra-practical hats were all over Instagram this summer, and the three designers left eye-catching designs in fashion.
Valentino's most famous design was a light brown feather-like hat with a wide handle that completely covered the model's head.
Other costumes of considerable size included jewel-encrusted pumpkins, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has a strange set of masks that will be perfect for the upcoming Halloween season.
Most of the colorful masks were lip-locked and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than the fancy designs.
One design, with snook and goggles, looked like a scuba diving suit, and another, like a melted ice cream cone.
If you're looking for a major fashion show, you're in luck.
As fashion enthusiasts predict, these fancy hats will be on your street.
The large hats of this size came with a two-foot wide straw hat, the Zula Bomb, which could be seen everywhere from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
At the height of the impractical, social media sensation, another design came along with this hat - a straw beach bag the size of a swimsuit-wearing model.
The burnt-orange straw bag with a white leather handle was a highlight of Jacques La Rivera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told Femme: "I expect big hats and beach bags next summer - the designer has made such an impact that the potential demand for big clothes cannot be ignored".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a record of academic excellence, with a stronger track record in sports, arts, music and other community activities, and continued to do so in 2018 with a further outstanding test scores.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) represents schools that strive to provide the highest standard of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are proactive in their goal of preparing their students for further and higher education as well as their chosen careers and as global citizens.
We see modern languages as a popular and preferred subject to study in schools as a field of education where a formal school curriculum can be designed and implemented.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, what you say goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will touch his heart.
This is a great lesson to us that we cannot rely solely on English when it comes to building relationships and gaining trust with people in other countries.
Recent exam results this year show that languages are at the top of the list of top independent schools with the highest pass rates.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received top grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored higher in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, and 69 percent in French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill for children and young people in the future.
Languages, which are an elective subject on the curriculum of independent schools as well as elsewhere, are considered on an equal footing with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and the Hacking Industry found that 17 percent of the difficulties entrepreneurs had in filling job vacancies were linked to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increasing number of jobs that require language skills, these skills are becoming essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if one is learning a second language, it is very beneficial to have this lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people in foreign countries will always put a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
In a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent found that they could not speak a foreign language with the ability to maintain a conversation, and 15 percent spoke only French as their second language.
That is why it is important to invest in teaching languages to today's children.
In developing lands in particular, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment if they are able to speak several languages.
In Scotland, the language of instruction varies from one school to another.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are seen as important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, independent schools have a choice of languages and have specialised teachers to teach them.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children for the future and perfects them with the necessary skills.
In a global business environment, it is undeniable that languages are crucial for the future of the country, and these needs must be reflected through education.
Modern languages should be considered international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young community.
It must be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
Labron starts his Lakers season in Santiago this Sunday.
LeBron, with his opening game against the Los Angeles Lakers, will end a long wait for fans.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in the pre-season opener on Sunday in San Diego.
However, he has not yet decided how long he will play.
Walton told the Lakers official website that it's going to be a little over a minute and 48 seconds.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play a limited number of minutes.
After a pre-season practice earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-matches to prepare for the level I'm at in my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia Waves, his YouTube channel
President Trump begins his campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be Trump's first of five waves planned for next week, with stops in several friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote to decide his choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy was suspended, and Trump is building support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress with the November vote.
When and how will Trump's West Virginia rally be held tonight and watched online?
The rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. today.
On YouTube, you can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube via the following stream.
Meanwhile, Trump will speak about the delay in the Senate vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court for a week because of the FBI's investigation into a sexual assault allegation.
But the primary purpose of these heated meetings is to get the Republicans in the running for the November election.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign says the five waves of campaigns over the next week will focus on Republicans seeking to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as boosting volunteers and supporters.
As we head into a busy election campaign, control of Congress is crucial to his agenda, so he will travel to as many states as possible, a campaign spokesman for Trump who declined to be identified told Reuters.
Metro News, West Virginia, reports that the rally, which will take place at the Westbank Arena in Newnan, will bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will receive Pittsburgh media coverage.
Saturday's trip to West Virginia, which received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016, is Trump's second trip there in the past month.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senator Patrick Morrissey of Virginia, who is on his way to the polls.
Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said the president's presence to help with the ninety-first election was not a good sign for Morrissey, Reuters news agency reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is in the midst of a highly anticipated game on Sunday.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's four-man team may be the thing to beat for the Ryder Cup.
Swinging vertical acceleration is a completely newly invented game concept but something that players rely heavily on, and this game is a perfect example of that.
Where are they at with the speed now?
"They had a six-point field goal, now it's four, so I think it's a bit of a momentum", Jordan Speith says.
With a four-point lead and 12 games to go, Europe is in a really good position.
According to Speeth, the Americans have little wind to sail their cruise and much to cheer them up.
From T to Green, he played with a spirit and set an example for all.
The resulting celebratory sound echoed throughout his playing days, and he and Thomas scored on equal terms.
He scored 15 runs and made a similar sound as he pushed the ball, showing everyone that the American team was still in the game.
"You have to play the game, you have to be afraid of your own game", said Speeth.
That's all these players have left.
There are 18 holes to make it.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have outscored Thomas and Speith, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's favorite players are unlikely to be mistaken.
The only pair not to hit more than one home run on Saturday night was Hollywood, but they also missed the game on Saturday, playing Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
Their strength, driven by rising tide, was seen to be a remarkable display of strength, as they realized that they were the only ones who could beat the others on Sunday and that no one but Fleetwood or Molinari could beat Europe at La Golf Nationals.
Most often, this occurs in other openings at the same time.
But it's too early to talk about the splendor of Europe.
Baby Watson and Web Simpson, the hero of the morning's Fourball, Sergio Garcia, made a quick farewell when they paired up with Alex Noreen.
With one extra hit and a double in the front nine, the Spaniard and the Swede fell into a pit from which they could hardly recover.
However, on Sunday, there's no one to help you.
Football and foosball matches are fascinating because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice given, the advice not given, and the instantaneous change of strategy.
So far, Europe has played well as a team, and has a significant lead going into the final day, but in this Fossum match, the U.S. team has shown that it is also a significant contender.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 10-6.
Europe is moving strongly into the final day of the Ryder Cup, with a 10-6 lead over the United States after Saturday's foosball and foursome matches.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari beat Tiger Woods to tie the game at La Golf Nacional and took two victories.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, determined to win back the trophy they lost two years ago, beat the Americans 3-1 in the morning football match.
In Fosham, the United States showed more resistance and won two games, but they could not score fewer points.
For Jim Furyk, he needs eight points from 12 singles games on Saturday to win the Cup.
The first European to score four points in a row was Fleetwood's arm, known as the "Mollywood", and he and Molinari became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in each of their opening four games.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foibles, Woods and American Bryson DeCampo were defeated by another strong 5 and 4.
Despite his two-game hitting streak on Saturday, Woods lost 19 of his 29 Foosball and Foosball games, including seven straight.
After a break for the morning foosball, Justin Rose joined his teammate Henrik Stenson for the Foosball World Cup, losing 2-1 to world number one and second place Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopeca.
Europe did not find its way to this pleasant, windy Paris in the far southwest.
Three-time champions Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas scored a two-point lead over the Americans on Saturday.
They beat the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Polter 2 to 1 and beat Polter and Rory McCroy 4 to 3 at Foursome, losing both opening holes.
A team with four points less was in the Ryder Cup only twice, but Furyk's team needed a tie to win the Cup.
After two days of second best, Sunday looks to be even further along.
North Korea says it will never unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are increasing mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances his country would never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Speaking at the annual general assembly of the world body, Ri Yong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has taken significant positive steps, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, removing nuclear sites, and not increasing its nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no relevant response from the United States", he said.
"We have no confidence in our national security without any confidence in the United States, and under no circumstances will we disarm it unilaterally".
While Ri has repeatedly expressed opposition to Washington's "phase-by-phase" approach to denuclearization and North Korea's complaint about the systematic steps taken there, one thing that has emerged is that Pyongyang has not been unilaterally denied its control over denuclearization, as it has in the past.
At the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 2, Frey commented on the joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, in which Kim pledged to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang has first abandoned its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of severe sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States will be forced to denuclearize first and will increase the pressure on the sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, including the declaration of an end to the war", said Re.
The idea of being identified by connectors is a fantasy for those who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that continued sanctions increase our distrust.
The UN did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was planned earlier this week.
Referring to meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the minister said: "If the other side in this disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so impeded".
However, the tone of Re's speech was very different from his statement to the UN General Assembly last year, in which he said that North Korea's missiles would inevitably target US soil after President Trump called Kim a suicide rocket man.
At the UN last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, but praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm this year, but also said they had worked through it and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, and that it was fine if it took two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia say they should be compensated for Pyongyang's actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions is very strictly enforced until we see that disarmament has been completed, final and verifiable".
Since 2006, the Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea by unanimous decision to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, and the last one was not so good.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying North Korea accused him of making assassin-like demands despite making progress.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised that it would remove a missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate action.
He said Kim said the "corresponding measures" he hoped for were Trump's security pledge in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard teaches students a course on getting enough rest.
To counter the growing culture of caffeinated late-night naps, Harvard University has introduced a new course to help graduates get more sleep.
One scientist found that students at the world's number one university have no idea of the most basic aspects of taking care of their health.
The course was designed by Charles Seizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it will be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
A student came up to me and asked: "Why are you telling me this in my senior year without telling me first?"
She said that no one had ever taught her about the value of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains the basic concepts of how adequate sleep affects academic and athletic performance and how to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after a week of students suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
This one-hour course will consist of a series of interactive tasks.
In one episode, there is an image of a laboratory room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, we discuss how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, stress, and cancer.
There is a map of the university with interactive icons where participants are guided to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
"But we believe they have a right to know about the health benefits of smoking and to know about it", said Prof. Seizler.
He says that the pride of the culture of sleep-dwelling and studying all night long still prevails, and that modern technology and ever-increasing stress indicate that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough quality sleep is a secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety - and it's important to prevent weight gain, because when you don't sleep, your brain goes into fasting mode, which causes you to starve constantly, he says.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, attended Professor Zeissler's classes in his first year and helped him design the course.
He said that this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to make it a course offered throughout the university.
He hopes the next step is for graduate students to complete a similar course of study before joining this competitive institution.
Dr. Zeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm to wake them up and to put them to sleep, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electric screens and LED lights, which can interfere with your brain's circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Menga's goal has dragged Gerard's team down.
Dolly Menga defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 in Livingston, giving the Rangers another tough attack.
The Ibrox team were looking to claim their first victory since their 4-1 win over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team marked Gerrard's second defeat.
Menga scored his goal with seven minutes to go and the Rangers lined up without any defenses.
The Rangers will drop to sixth place and Livingston will drop to third, trailing only Hibernian in the division.
And the Rangers will have a harder time after Kalam Spence is sent to repair a head injury from a kick from outside the stadium.
Gerard had eight changes in his side when he reached the semi-finals of the AIR from the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went ahead with the same 11 lives and scored a run off the Hearts last week, and their well-dressed suit showed a breathless shadow of all the other players on his opponent's team.
Despite the Rangers' good possession of the ball, Livingston made good use of his own.
Menga's first stop saw Scott Pittman throw the ball into Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder got his chance.
Keegan Jacobs' free throw went to skipper Craig Hulket, and his defensive partner was able to escape from the backfield.
The Rangers took control, but their game was more about hope than confidence.
The Colombian referee Stephen Thompson rejected the request, saying that Morelos felt that the ball that had hit Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lolos should have been a penalty kick.
The Rangers were able to hit the target in the first inning, but the shot to the head by former airbox keeper Liam Kelly or Ovi Ezaria was not a challenge.
Levy's opening shot in the 34th minute proved to be a counter-attack, but no one can deny that they had it.
The Rangers again failed to fight Jacob's attack.
Scott Erfield was doing nothing when Declan Gallagher pointed the ball at Scott Robinson and was calm for Menga's final easy hit.
Gerard Ryan replaced Kent with Kolibaly, who was a good substitute but was blocked by Kelly.
However, with Lithgow and Hulket pushing the ball for hours, Livingston continued to fail to deliver the match that the crowd was eager to watch.
Holt's shot could have increased the gap to the final round, but McGregor held Jacobus up before hitting Lithgow with his head.
Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for another penalty, but Thompson refused.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
Now for our Sunday morning edition: On this day, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm von Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this discovery later developed into the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which occupies a prominent place in science, also became a staple of popular culture. This was made possible by the 1950s film The Gambles of Coronado, starring two cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is this?
A Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
You put these earphones on a mountain, the radioactivity in the minerals makes the sound of atoms.
Yeah, now blow it up!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his discovery will immortalize his name.
A new cancer vaccine trains the immune system to recognize dead cells.
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to detect and kill deadly cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine trains the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
In this technique, immune cells are taken from a patient and modified in a laboratory.
They can then detect a protein that is common in most cancers and inject it back.
The experimental vaccine has been shown to be effective in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received treatment with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, found that her ovarian cancer disappeared after 18 months.
In this technique, immune cells are taken from a patient, where they are modified in the laboratory to produce HER2, a protein common to many cancers, and then injected back into the cells.
"Our results suggest that this vaccine may be a good thing", said Professor J. Bersovsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 is implicated in the development of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, prostate and anal cancers, explained Professor Brozovsky.
The use of immune cells from patients to target cancer cells has also been shown to be effective in treating leukemia.
Kanye West, after the SNL show, will wear a mega hat and make a Trumpist comment.
It didn't go well.
After praising US President Donald Trump and saying he should run for the same office in 2020, Kanye was booed during a Saturday Night Live show.
That night, he wore a "Make America Great" hat and played Ghost Town as his third song, and then he lashed out at the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they ask, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
"If I had thought about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
The SNL program began with a satirical sketch by Matt Doman, created by Christie Blasey Ford, mocking Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a charge of sexual harassment.
West's rebuke was not broadcast, but it was leaked to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if the post was made by Rock to mock West.
West also told his audience that his helmet made him feel very uncomfortable behind the scenes.
"They mocked and harassed me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with your hat on".
They hurt me!
Then they said I was in a failed state, reported the Washington Examiner.
"I can wear my Superman logo, I can't tell you what to do. Do you want to see the world go on?"
Try to make love.
His comments brought a howl from the SNL audience twice, and Variety reported that the members seemed to be in a state of shock, with one saying: "The whole studio was engulfed in a deep silence".
The late rapper Mac Miller has replaced his girlfriend Ariana Grande as West's backup singer.
West's song "I Love It" was a surprise to many, wearing a Perrier bottle.
Candace Turner, leader of the TPUSA Conservative group, tweeted her support for West: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you for standing up to the rioters".
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just acting like him, it's really beautiful".
But I would never agree to support someone I believe holds a view that is harmful to my community (by supporting his art or buying his music or clothes).
He's free.
"We too", she said.
Before the show, the rapper announced that he had changed his name and would now officially be known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he's following in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pee Dee.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and was later known simply as Prince.
The charges of conspiracy to murder in the Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following a stabbing in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The police said the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast County Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harrington is speaking out against being a bad guy.
Keith Harrington is the swordsman John Snow of HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor speaks out against the stereotype of the stylish hero, saying that by showing such characters on screen, he sends a message to young boys that to be respected, you have to be stylish and tough.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that the season was a mistake, and questioned how to deal with the toxic issue of the pyramid in the #MeToo era.
Recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Keith said he felt compelled to take on the challenge.
I feel, personally and deeply, at this moment, where we went wrong as men", he said.
What did we teach the men who were involved in this matter as they grew up?
Kit believes that the more aggressive male characters on television are partly responsible for the rise of this toxic idea of masculinity.
He added: "What is it that nature brings, what is it that it teaches?
From the television and on the street, young boys are taught that we must be built up in this way to become men.
I think this is one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change this?
Because there is clearly something wrong with these young boys.
He admitted in the interview that he would not be participating in any pre or post-Game of Thrones episode, which ends next summer, saying that his time with the battlefield and the horses was over.
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, a play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that the best thing he's gotten from Game of Thrones is meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife here, and in that way it gave me my future family and then my life", he said.
Rose played Yegret, the love interest of Jon Snow in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases.
China reports a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, there are over 820,000 cases nationwide.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a different story from the past.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, HIV is transmitted rapidly through the bloodstream of infected people.
But a Chinese health official told a conference in Yunnan that this approach had reduced HIV infections to zero.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted infection (STI) has been a major problem among China's gay, lesbian, transgender community.
China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997, but discrimination against the gay, lesbian, transgender community is widespread.
Studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
The most common cause of transmission is inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, as part of the effort to address the problem, the organization has pledged to provide universal access to treatment for HIV-infected people.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP senator's information was leaked by a member of his staff, exposing dangerous lies and elaborate war theories.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information on three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were made by "far-right" scholars and websites.
Waters' spokesperson on Twitter said: "Mouse, mouse and most awful mouse".
The release of the information said to include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Michael Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators were questioned.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified as the source of these posts were linked to Waters' offices, and Hill reported that a member of Waters' staff had leaked the information.
"These unproven allegations are completely false and misleading", Waters said.
The identity, privacy and security of a member of my staff have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, and the member is not responsible for any leakage of this information.
These unproven allegations are completely false and misleading.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This refusal is outrageous", wrote Fletcher.
This shows that she lacks the emotional characteristics of a congresswoman.
If someone is accusing someone of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They shouldn't object.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must remain calm and composed.
Fleisher Waters's response appeared to be a way of trying to reconcile criticism of the judge with criticism of the judge, who was accused of being furious at Thursday's trial.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
"The truth is it's huge", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said she had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent allegations.
"We assure you that these perpetrators will be quickly exposed", she said, "and will be held accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to anyone and everyone on my staff".
Johnny English Strike Again - Rowan Atkinson, the unqualified, fraudulent spy
It is now common to link Brexit to any new British-oriented film, including the return of the action-comedy series Johnny English, which began in 2003 as Johnny English and came to be known as Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Does this satirical self-comedy show how useless we are as a nation in this new export era?
The eye-catching, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has received his license to do everything wrong for the second time - a name that signals, above all, a wide-ranging comedy creation designed for non-English-speaking film fans.
He's actually a silly detective with some semblance of Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the man who played the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in his bizarre disguise.
He's also based on the now-lost Barclaycard TV commercial starring Atkinson, the mysterious International Man and Traveler.
There are a couple of great scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I love the scene where Johnny English rides into a helicopter in medieval armor with helicopter blades attached to his helmet.
While it is a good example of Atkinson's ability to present physical humor, the satire is somewhat weak and overblown, as the character is now incorporated into the more serious 007 and Mission: Impossible films.
The satire seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and I find Johnny English's absurd errors not as creative and innovative as Atkinson's silent performance in Mr. Bean.
This timely example shows that Great Britain is now in a serious crisis.
A cyber hacker gains access to a top-secret British intelligence network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, and provoking the panic of a low-level agent on duty for Kevin Elden.
It is the final straw for the then politically disgruntled and utterly deformed Prime Minister: this half-Theresa, Emma Thompson, who plays the role, is doing very well, but she has little to do in the script.
Her intelligence advisers say that since every spy has been captured, she should bring in a retired one.
The man is employed as a schoolteacher at a prestigious institution - but he teaches to operate undercover - John English: Here are some jokes about English teaching espionage in a modern school.
He is summoned to the English White Hall for an emergency call, where he is reunited with his longtime colleague, Bo (played by Ben Miller).
Now that Bo is married and his wife is a high-class submarine commander, Vicky Pepperdin is apparently not being used properly.
The two, who have done everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are reunited and meet the beautiful and sexy Ofelia Bulotov, played by Olga Kuryelenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is caught by a tech billionaire from Hebei who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem, and is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bo begin their adventurous journey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause a huge stir on Volta's luxury yacht, and English attempts to use a virtual reality headset to gain insight into the interior of Volta's home, becoming in complete chaos.
Each episode leads to the final quarter, but overall, it's a bit of a children's show.
It's all normal.
And I wondered about other Johnny English films: Couldn't the British film industry have a role that matched Rowan Atkinson's talent and was fair to it?
Labour rejects a plan to change the British working week to four days and pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is being considered for a radical plan to bring Britain's four-day workweek to five-day pay.
The party reportedly wants the company owners to use the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution to provide employees with one day off.
The new arrangement allows workers to have a three-day weekend and receive the same salary as before.
According to sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to lead the country towards better working conditions.
The idea of a four-day workweek was introduced by the Trade Union Congress as a way to gain advantages for workers in the face of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year".
The four-day workweek is in line with the Party's ambition to rebalance the economy in a way that benefits workers, and with the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The idea was not first proposed by the Labour Party, which promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole has not yet endorsed this intention.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a policy of the party and is not being taken into account by the party".
Vice Chancellor John McDonnell, outlined his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
Mr. McDonnell has stated that he is determined to take back power from the faceless directors and beneficiaries of the subsidiaries.
Another thing that the Vice Chancellor's plan means is that the current shareholders of water companies will not have to buy back all their shares because they will be subject to deductions for wrongdoing.
He also outlined his plans to include employees on company boards and to set up inter-group ownership funds to provide employees with 10 per cent of the private sector's gross annual dividend of around £500.
"Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, tells 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation into Ken will change his mind".
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether any Republican senators will back him in the face of revelations by the bureau.
Sunday's 60 Minutes will air with reporter Scott Pelly asking Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI might uncover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
I think, really, Kennedy said.
Woma went to the trial and spoke to Judge Kawano.
I called him after this happened, when the accusation was made, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was very firm, determined and very clear in his views.
However, Graham's vote seems unlikely to be changed.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it will be a big charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham Christine Blasey Ford said in a statement.
No one who named him could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't think anything will change.
What is the Global Citizenship Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizens' Festival, an annual superstar-themed music festival with the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
The Global Citizenship Festival marks its seventh year this year, with thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only hear Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizenship Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that aims to increase the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees at the show have to complete a series of tasks, or volunteer, email a world leader, raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty, and engage in other meaningful activities.
But how successful has the Global Citizenship Festival been at a time when it is only 12 years away from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of giving away free tickets to a concert a genuine way to get people to do something about it, or is it just another so-called "clicktivism" where they think they're making a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens Group says it has documented the activities of its 19 million supporters in various causes.
These actions have led world leaders to announce policies and flagship projects related to the goal, which is said to have a total value of over $3 trillion that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first half of 2018, the group showed that it had 390 projects and had raised or spent at least $10 billion in funding through its activities.
The group says that the funds raised have so far directly affected more than 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key projects are Power of Nutrition, a partnership of U.S. investors dedicated to helping children develop their full potential, which has pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the injustice of malnutrition in history", said Tracy Ullman, representative of Power of Nutrition, at a live event in London in April 2018.
The group added that after more than 5,000 such initiatives to motivate the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responds: "It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we may fall and fail.
But like the great movements of civil rights and anti-apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger when we unite.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars of this year's New York show, which will be hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use naval "barriers" to disrupt Russian energy exports, Interior Secretary says.
US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has said that Washington could use the Navy to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, if necessary, reports the Washington Examiner.
Zinc alleges that Russia's intervention in Syria at the invitation of the regular government is a strategy for its exploration of new energy markets.
"The reason they are in the Middle East is because they are connected to the energy as they are in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", he said.
The officer has a way and means of handling the situation.
"The United States is able to work with our Navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and block them to prevent their energy from reaching the market if necessary", he said.
Zinc made the announcement at an event hosted by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that is known as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
Comparing Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, he said they were similar.
"The economic option between Iran and Russia is more or less leverage and fuel substitution", he said, noting that Russia is already economically dependent on fossil fuels and is only capable of doing so.
The statements came as the Trump administration is trying to expand its liquefied natural gas exports to replace Russia, which has so far been a more profitable option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to force Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, as Trump has said it will be a disaster for Berlin and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is planned to increase the existing pipeline to a capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's strong opposition to the project is based purely on economic considerations and is an example of unfair competition.
"We all agree that energy should not be used as a tool to create pressure, consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in September after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
The move by the United States has sparked strong opposition in Germany, which has therefore reiterated its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries, Germany's main organization for industry, has informed the United States to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very concerned about the interference of a third state in our energy supply", Dieter Kemph, head of the Federation of German Industries, said after a recent meeting between German Ambassador Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts says she will seriously consider running for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the upcoming midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was running for the office at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it is important that a woman is at the top", she said, the Hill newspaper quoted her as saying.
I am seriously considering whether to run for president after November 6th.
City Hall Mayor Warren spoke of President Trump as leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "We really need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a poll released on Thursday found that a majority of Warren's own voters say she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who were "ready" to vote in Massachusetts said she should not run, according to a Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported it.
Former Governor Deval Patrick received the most votes in the poll, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other top Democrats discussed as potential candidates for the 2020 presidential election included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, he will make a decision in January.
Sarah Palin speaks at a rally for Donald Trump about her post-traumatic stress disorder
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
"The pain my child is going through, the pain he is going through after he returns, is like other families suffering from the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, our soldiers come with these wounded souls", he said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said of his arrest: "It is an obvious but not a negotiable issue. And her son, like other war veterans, comes back with a certain difference, they come with a hard heart, wondering if their fellow soldiers and airmen, all other members of the military, have any respect for the service they have done to this country".
He was arrested in Vasillia, Alaska, on Monday on charges of unlawfully assaulting a woman and carrying a weapon while intoxicated, according to a Vasillia police spokesman.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia will support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies shelter to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a transcript of a lawsuit in Washington last Friday in support of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the attorney was not disclosed during the August session of Grace v. Civil Liberties Union's suit against federal policy.
She claimed that she had been abused by her partner and her sons, members of a violent gang, but US officials had denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described that a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are from El Salvador, Honolulu and Guatemala, countries that have been plagued by gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy, which allowed undocumented migrants who suffered domestic violence to apply for asylum, has reversed the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rakin issued a statement Friday saying the new policy violates decades of state, federal and international law.
"All claims for asylum under federal law must be judged on their specific facts and circumstances, and this would violate that principle", the brief reads.
Lawyers further argued that since immigrants often provide labor to entrepreneurs and suppliers, denying them entry into the United States would harm the country's economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims seeking protection from domestic abuse and gang violence.
Those who leave their home country due to any discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion may be protected", said Sessions, announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not a solution to all problems, including the serious problems that people around the world face daily.
With the death toll doubling, a massive rescue operation is underway in Palu to search for survivors.
The survivors have been exposed to extreme conditions.
"I am under a lot of stress", said Reza Kusuma, 35, comforting her feverish son in a completely abandoned detention center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulance is bringing in bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents are seen moving to their destroyed homes, grabbing up their wet, flooded belongings and trying to recover everything they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded in the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Dwayne Harris and several other wounded with broken back and shoulders are being treated outside the Pallu Military Hospital for multiple post-traumatic stress disorder.
He was in his hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter, and his eyes filled with tears as he contemplated the violent earthquake.
We didn't have time to save our lives.
I think I got caught in the broken walls. " Harris told the Associated Press, they were in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of playing games with propaganda.
A Chinese state newspaper, along with a US daily, published a four-page ad about the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, accusing Beijing of using the US ambassador to China for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the supplement paid for by the Des Moines Register, a newspaper with a local store in Iowa, accusing it of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a new phase in Washington's increasing efforts to put pressure on China, a US official told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, this is especially the case as Beijing and China are currently in a growing trade war and have imposed a number of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and US experts say China's counter-tariff impositions at the start of the trade war were designed to target exporters from states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, which exports agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an op-ed for the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China is now doubling down on the violence by advertising in our own independent media.
"In the course of this propaganda campaign, the Chinese government is exploiting the US tradition of free speech and free press to its advantage by posting paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Bransted wrote.
"Here in Beijing, all media are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, so you will not find any true representation of the Chinese people's views on China's troubled economic journey in the street newspapers", he wrote.
He said that a major Chinese newspaper, without naming him, had omitted to publish his article.
With the upcoming election, Republicans are isolating women, analysts warn.
As many high-profile Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in several sexual harassment allegations, analysts warn they will be pushed back by women in particular in the upcoming election.
The mood is very high and many Republicans have already declared a need for a vote.
"Nothing can be undone", Granerheuer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told the Hill in an article published Saturday.
Senator Jeff Flake (Representative from Arizona) was cleared at the last minute for an FBI investigation, but it is doubtful if it will be enough to appease angry voters, said Rieher.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and in November, said Kerin Jean Pierre, national editor and senior adviser at the progressive group Move On, the Washington, DC newspaper reported on Friday.
On Friday morning, as the Republicans controlled the court to proceed with the nomination of Keanu despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters protested outside the Senate, shouting that November was coming.
"The enthusiasm of the Democrats is enormous", said the neutral political analyst Sturtenberg to a news website.
People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can go higher, especially among the disengaged cantons in the suburbs and young people aged 18 to 29 who don't usually vote because they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee were made public, analysts warned that there could be some setback if the Republicans go ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a mess for the Republican Party, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News.
"It's not a question of whether the committee votes or the final vote or who gets to examine it, it's a question of how the Republicans handled it and how they handled her", Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that supports the Democratic nomination, told the news outlet.
However, in the face of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, most Americans are left with the question of who to trust, even if they are in favor of Kavanaugh.
A new poll from YouGov showed that 41 percent strongly or mostly accepted Ford's testimony, and 35 percent strongly or mostly believed someone else.
In addition, 38 percent said that Cavanaugh was often or definitely inaccurate in his testimony, and 30 percent said that Ford did.
The Guardian reports that the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and Deborah Ramirez at the insistence of Flake.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was poisoned by a drunk driver when she was 17.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party in the 1980s when he was a student at Yale.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a new Internet to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from this tech legend, InRapt, builds on the open source platform of Solid by Berners Lee.
Solid allows its users to choose where they want their data to be stored and to choose which information which person can access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee jokingly stated that the idea of InRapt is to rule the world.
"We must do it now", he says of his origins.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of online private databases is that the user can completely choose which data can be accessed by which people.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
John Bruce, CEO of INREPT, said the idea is that the company should bring the resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
At the moment the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, a community of developers and volunteer coders contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrapport website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking about making or not making a complete change with Facebook and Google as their business models are all upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Saturday Medium, Berners Lee states that the mission of Inraptor is to provide a commercial powerhouse and ecosystem that protects the authenticity and quality of the new web built on solids.
In 1994, Berners-Lee, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent times, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
While launching Inraptor, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era in the world of the web", said Lee.
The first World War, the Victoria Cross Cathedral
The first Church of England parish priest to serve as a fighter in the First World War and be awarded the Victoria Cross is celebrated in his hometown for almost 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Belenglis and Lehighcote on September 29, 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper's bullet, unaware that he had been awarded the highest British war honour.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial to him on Saturday in the middle of a war memorial in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the unveiling of the monument 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning battle is "very symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van Zandt was leading his troops across the Canal de Saint Quentin amidst thick fog and the shelling and machine gun fire of the battlefield.
He then ran to the line of fire and with heroic courage, single-handedly used his field guns to defeat three legions.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month before the war ended.
"I never could forgive myself for the actions of my grandparents", says 72-year-old Michael Van, "but they had a profound effect on us".
He and his brother Dr. James Van wore a bouquet of flowers after the parade, led by the Brettonwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
"It was a great honor to be part of the parade", said Michael Van, "and the award for a brave and true hero was well presented by a large crowd".
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 get Peppa Pig instead.
Think about it, you're up all night watching Ballerina 2016, and you end up not seeing the main event.
The San Jose tournament featured 13 matches, including six majors, and was shown on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
As Gagar's Mussi and Rory McDonald prepare to face off at 6pm, UK viewers were overwhelmed by the sudden appearance of Peppa Pig on the channel.
Some who had been sleeping for the match were disappointed.
A sports fan on Twitter said the switch to children's cartoons was "crazy".
In an interview, Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said that if by 6pm the current program is not suitable for children, it is a government regulation to switch it to a children's program.
Peppa the Pig, yeah.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker says he's working on a schedule that includes U.S. viewers in the future.
"Every time I think about a re-evaluation, I think about it, and I think maybe something can be done about it", Cocker said.
But it's Sunday morning at six, Sunday our time, and Monday their time, and I don't think we can do anything.
But we're working on it.
There were a lot of messages after that game change, none of them friendly.
We're trying to fix it, but we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it's not, it's a government issue.
I can promise you that next time it won't be.
We're trying to keep it five games instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we've tried to make this a little bit more for our fans, but it's unnecessary.
This is a sad situation.
Tom Dalí had a sexual fantasy about being gay.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says that he grew up with more of a dream than anyone else because of his sexuality, but that it inspired him to succeed.
He said that he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he was in high school.
On the Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that being a father had made him less concerned about his Olympic achievements.
The regular presenter of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daly, who joined Laverne's first show as a different person, said that he grew up feeling inferior to others because he was not as socially accepted as boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, feeling inferior, feeling different, gives me the strength and energy to succeed".
He said that he wanted to be seen as something, so that no one would be disappointed when his sexuality finally became known.
A two-time Olympic bronze medallist, he is a high-profile member of and advocate for the lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. He was used to urge other countries to decriminalize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said that he was blessed to be able to live in openness and spoke openly to give others the same hope.
He described how he became a three-time world champion and fell in love with a man he met in 2013 - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Dalí, who was married to the Oscar winner 20 years his senior, says that age difference was never a problem.
Having experienced so many things at such a young age - he competed in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died three years later - he said it was hard to find a peer with the same victories and defeats.
In June, the couple had a son, Robert Black Dalley, who is now a completely different person.
"If you asked me this last year, I would have said winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more things than gold.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer.
His father never believed he would die, and one of his last wishes was that if he got tickets to London in 2012, he wanted to sit first class.
I couldn't tell him you weren't gonna be in the front row long enough, Dad.
"I was there when he stopped breathing, holding his hand, and I felt I could beat him, and the moment I knew he stopped breathing and died", he said.
The following year, in 2012, Daly won an Olympic bronze medal.
"I knew my whole life that this was my dream - to dive in front of my countrymen at the Olympic Games, it's never felt better", he said.
It was also the basis for his first song selection, Heather Small's Pride, but his body felt still limp on the Olympic track.
Desert Island Disc is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who played poorly, will be disqualified from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson, who will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup race, will have to sit out to prevent it from becoming a disappointing moment.
Mickelson, playing in his 12th biennial, was ruled out of the football and foursome games on Saturday by captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of playing normally in the United States, the five-time winner was out of the game, encouraging players to wait until the cause of his pain was corrected.
The 48-year-old, who was not the best at hitting straight, was not in the best shape for the tough golf tournament.
If this path doesn't leave him too far behind, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
Mickelson's game will be crucial to give the Americans a warm start, four points behind in 12 singles.
Furyk didn't trust this man because he had something else to do.
"He was fully aware of the task ahead of him today, and he tapped me on the back and put his hand on my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a very talented player and he's done a lot for the team in the past and this week.
I never saw him play two games.
I was hoping for more, but with this mine, we thought this is what we should do.
He wanted to be there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games ever.
This may be his last Ryder Cup race on the course, which has often been his personal best.
Furyk said that the presence of Mickelson brought a certain sensitivity to the team, but he won 18 and lost 20 and a half seven.
He's funny, he's not a prankster, he's a fun person, and he's worth having in the team room, he explained.
Younger players enjoy being with him, and it's fun to watch.
He's going to give us more than a game.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the gap between big scores is quickly disappearing.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the gap between these points will be unbearable throughout the Ryder Cup final.
The Danishman played against the Americans in the 1997 tournament in Valderrama with the support of Steve Ballesteros, with a five-point lead, and won with a low score of 141⁄2-131⁄2 in the end.
"We had a big gap in Waldemar on Friday and yesterday, and we had a big gap in Brooklyn, and we lost, and we won in Waldemar by a very small margin", said Björn.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that this is not over.
You will be at your full strength tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
This isn't over until you score on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to try to win this medal, and the goal is to do it.
As Mavisin said from the beginning, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but on the other side - we know very well that they are the best players in the world".
"I was so happy to see the way a hard golf course played out", said Björn. "I could not have done this on my own.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the day when individual talents will do something different.
It's nice to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're alone, you're completely tested for your abilities as a golfer.
To get the most out of yourself tomorrow, that's the message you need to take to your players.
Now, let your partner follow in your footsteps and give it his best shot".
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform well individually rather than as partners, and Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three of the four points, are not included.
Furyck, who was part of Brooklyn's winning team before being eliminated by Europe in the "Miracle at Medina", played on both sides in those final days of the tournament.
When asked in 1999 how coach Ben Crenshaw had lined up his players for the final day, he replied: "I remember every word of it",
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'll want to get that quick start like you saw in Brooklyn, you saw in Medina.
When that speed goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We'll prepare accordingly and get the members to compete in a way that we feel is right, and as you know, we'll try to do a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with leading the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the top half, and other Europeans in the top half, Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, respectively.
"I went ahead with this order with this group because I thought it would cover everything", Björn said of his singles choices.
The new German battleship has been postponed.
The German Navy's newest warship was due to enter service in 2014 to replace older Cold War warships, but due to faulty systems and the rising cost of the Zeugreifen, it will not be deployed until at least next year, local media reports.
The commissioning of the new Baden-Württemberg-class flagship, the Rhineland-Pfalz, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit newspaper reports, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems hampered the completion of the forward project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class ships.
They will have a powerful artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and secret technologies such as low radar, infrared and sonic sun.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the newest ships must be able to stay away from original ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships that allow Germany to project power overseas will be obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
When the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the ill-fated F125 made headlines last year.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back after being delivered.
Although the reason for the repatriation is not known, German media have cited a number of serious "software and hardware vulnerabilities" that would render the warship useless in a military operation.
The Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by 120 sailors, about half the crew of the older Bremen-class ships. Software flaws are significant.
Also, the ship is incredibly overweight, which reduces its performance while limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Falls" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the staff, is also becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached a whopping €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of acquiring the latest vessels are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defense committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "going beyond the range of ships that can be deployed".
The official said that the problem has developed over time as old ships have been taken out of service but new ships have not been delivered.
He expressed his regret that no Baden-Württemberg class ships would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust secretly listens to the secret life of bats.
A new study at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to find their food.
These findings will shed new light on the unique behavior of flying mammals and are expected to help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will observe common and soprano pipistrals as well as brown long-eared Dobbenton bats in Inverway Park, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
Hand-held detectors will also be used by NHS staff and volunteers to conduct mobile surveys.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's call and what species is doing.
A habitat map and report are then presented to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management tasks such as grassland design and how to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the bat population has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development that affect their roots and habitat loss.
Flies can also be caught by chemical agents in paper and building materials, as well as by attacks from pet cats, but wind gusts and lighting can also pose a risk.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use advanced acoustic-location technology to accurately detect spiders and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
The facility is staffed by ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, bird inspections, and occasional rescues.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Trew Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The mansion is the ideal home for them, says the manager, David Thompson.
"We have a large area for bats in Thrive", he said.
"We have old buildings, old trees and good homes.
But there is still so much we don't know about bats that our work here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to improve".
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before maintaining the property, as the accidental destruction of a single mother herd can kill 400 females and juveniles and wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their herds.
The Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Farrell, has been urged by the public to help.
"We have so much more to learn about our bats", she says, "and we don't know how their populations will develop for many of our species".
Lawyers are suing the German magazine, and Ronaldo denies corruption allegations.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", and says people using his name "want to promote themselves".
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus suspect Forward of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayoga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
A report in Der Spiegel on Friday said he was accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Hours after the allegation was reported, Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video, denouncing the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
What they said today, fake news", the Ballon d'Or winner says five times to the camera.
"They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's not unusual.
They want to be famous enough to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm happy and everything is going well", the player said with a laugh.
According to Reuters reports, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek "moral damages of a scale that matches the gravity of what could be the most serious violation of privacy rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a residential unit of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and claimed he was "99 percent" a "good man".
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but in a standard way.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was worried about "feeling reprisals" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old said she was continually shocked by the alleged incident and is now seeking to cancel the arbitration.
At the time of the alleged incident, Ronaldo was set to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will 'always be worried' about losing carmakers
If the UK loses its position as a world leader in car production after Brexit, the UK "will regret it forever", said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He also said it was "remarkable" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily suspend production at its plant in Barnaston, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the borders would increase labour costs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's Bernstein plant, which produces Oris and Avenices, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think we will see production at our plant stop if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March", said Mervyn Cook, managing director at Toyota's Barnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will be conducted.
For example, BMW says they will close their factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The key issue for carmakers is the supply chain risk in a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "on-time" basis, with parts being delivered to order cars every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
The industry says that if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and stock shortages.
Toyota will not be able to keep more than a day's worth of stock at its Derbyshire plant, which will stop production, the company says.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's chain-linking plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to stop those onions at the border".
"We need a deal deal. I say we want to make the best deal that allows us to not only enjoy the success of today but also to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we must definitely be able to maintain what was a very successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, and warned that additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and ultimately increase labor costs.
Peter Tsovallariz, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is a convener of the plant's United Trade Union, said his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience once these jobs are lost, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
The White House says the meeting between Rosenstein and Trump may be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday that a crucial meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein "has been pushed back another week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump supporters and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Washington has been feeding off rumours for months about whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and whether that will threaten Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN in New York City at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want to expel Rosenstein", but the hearing was later postponed to avoid impeding a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, further delaying a full Senate vote, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There is no date set for that, it could be this week, it seemed to me like another week of pushing back for everything else that is happening at the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I always like to keep the media informed".
Some reporters object to the statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the press conferences were not lacking in anger at TV reporters for "getting a big hit", adding: "I don't agree with their rise to prominence".
She then suggested that more direct meetings between Trump and the media would be held.
"The president has more question and answer sessions than any president before him", she said, without citing evidence: "We counted them".
Press conferences are ongoing, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly from the president of the United States, it would be more appropriate than talking to me".
We're going to try to do it pretty much, and you've seen us do it so many times over the last few weeks, that it's going to be like a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with potential guests.
Private press conferences are rarely held.
The president will explain to reporters gathered in New York City this week why his behavior is so free-spirited and sometimes absurd.
The NHS Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears.
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter saying the UK has less than six months to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to reimburse the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its entrusted public services.
In her letter, Ms. Preman noted: "Over the summer, discussions between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with the expected decisions to be reached this autumn.
But the UK government is also accelerating its preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very troubled time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the crew, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring invaluable experience and skills to strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, which benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we need you to stay".
After suffering a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Mike Ogan of Tennessee reports that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for a head injury after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
The accident occurred shortly before the end of the half, Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters.
"He came along the line and there was some kind of fall", Reed said.
Trainees and medical personnel put Abercrombie aside and gave him oxygen before putting him in the infirmary for further analysis.
An official with the Tennessee State team told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "there is no information yet on the type/size of the injury", and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Redshirt amateur Abercrombie is in his first season with the Tennessee State team since transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the race, bringing his total to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers are charged a high stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will help homeless people under the new Tory scheme.
This course of action will neutralize Corbyn's mission of attracting young voters.
The UK will charge stamp duty to non-taxpayers
The Treasury expects it to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and that the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to target younger voters by promising to provide more affordable housing and targeting those with higher incomes.
The stamp duty hike will be charged to non-taxable individuals and entities in the UK, and the extra money will encourage government action to fight back against sluggishness.
The surcharge, in addition to the current stamp duty, is likely to be around three percent of the higher levels introduced for second homes and buy-and-rent two years ago.
The Treasury expects this move to generate £120 million a year.
The price of newly built London properties has risen, with 13 per cent of them being bought by non-UK residents, making it harder for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" as more foreign buyers often spend time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut for young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of plotting land and keeping property prices high without using them, and he called on the lady to drop quotas for affordable housing to address Britain's "housing crisis".
Mr. Corbyn has proposed a series of sweeping housing reforms, including the end of rent controls and "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give the churches more power to build new homes.
She said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
It means stabilizing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, ease of home buying cannot be a good thing for people who do not live in the UK, as well as hardworking British citizens and companies with foreign sources.
The dream of many people of home ownership is far from being realized, and the humiliation of a rough sleep is becoming a reality".
'My only hope is to run Scotland.'
Sunderland captain Jacques Ross says his "only hope" is to become Scotland manager in some capacity.
The 42-year-old Scott is currently facing the challenge of reviving the third-placed club in League One.
St Mirren moved to the Stadium of Lights this summer after leading the team to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I got a B cap for it", Ross told BBC Sports Sound in Scotland.
"But I watched the Scottish team at Hampden a lot with my father when I was a kid, and it always pulled me back.
"I will only have that opportunity if I succeed in social management".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Aloha athletics director says he has no fear of leading a name in such a well-established club after previously turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I will measure my success at this moment by 'Can I send this club back to the Premier League?'
The structure and facilities of this club will definitely make it a Premier League club", he said.
"It is not an easy task to get there, but I can see that I have succeeded only if I can bring the community back there".
After a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hart, Ross has only spent three years in his managerial role.
He then helped Aloha return from relegation to tier three, and the following season transformed St Mirren from near relegation to championship winners.
"I'm so glad that I got to play for the club", says Ross. "I'm so happy that I'm playing for the clubs of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy".
"It was a real turning point", he recalled about taking over the Aloe.
"I honestly believed that I was better suited to managing than playing.
It seems amazing because I did the right thing, and I got a fair way of life from it, and I enjoyed a fair amount of benefits.
But playing games can be difficult.
There are many things you must accomplish each week.
I still do them when I'm under stress and pressure at work, but I feel like management is the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and it's the most comfortable thing I've ever experienced in my entire adult life".

A survey found that the best time to buy a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat waves are drawing more people to Britain's busy pubs but putting more pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales in bars and restaurant chains increased by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent, the statistics reveal.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continuing sunshine and the longer than expected delay in England's World Cup qualification meant that pubs saw sales rise by 2.8 percent in July, following a similar pattern to the previous month, June, and restaurants were hit harder than ever.
The decline in restaurant sales of 1.8 percent in June was worse in July.
The number of restaurants has declined, but restaurants and liquor stores tend to be more active than before.
Even restaurants that serve food, but not as much as those that run restaurants, have been hit by the sun.
It shows that people are going out to drink.
Sales of managed restaurants and pubs increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events are the main factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
With restaurant chains particularly vulnerable to ongoing cost pressures with year-on-year sales declines of 4.8 percent, it is no surprise that they continue to struggle.
Time will tell if the long hot summers have not brought the worst of times for the catering industry and the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will allow for the space needed".
The overall sales growth of restaurants and cafes, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand exposure.
Cofer Peach Tracker, an industry sales tracker for the UK restaurant, pub and café sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children has a secret social media account hidden from their parents
One survey found that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social-media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
This news has increased the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that are hidden from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in "fake Instagram" accounts, prompted by photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they maintain a "main" account that is satisfactory to show their parents, while also maintaining a private one.
One mother who accidentally entered her 13-year-old daughter's private Web site saw a teenager urging others to "rape me".
A survey by the Digital Awareness and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) in the UK found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and more than half of them tend to have personal accounts.
"It is a sad reality that so many young people are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them", said HMC CEO Mike Buchanan.
Eliad Doyle will become the "voice of the sport" of the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eliud Doyley has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and President Ian Batty described this as a great opportunity for the sport's administrators to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elide enjoys great recognition among the Scottish, UK and global athletic community and we are confident that bringing her to the Board will be of great benefit to athletics in Scotland", said Bathey.
"I am excited to act as a voice for the players and I believe I can truly contribute to driving the sport in Scotland", said Doyley.
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is now a regular on the BBC, was left unable to walk after a horse-riding accident.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a very tiring task, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and am now practicing mobility!
Thank you for all your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump company has been creating controversy online with an online ad comparing cows to mothers.
A breast pump company has distributed online advice with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of what is being called "the world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company LV released a commercial with a satirical music video depicting the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance from a haystack with cows to a song that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I drink milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you didn't know these nipples aren't wrinkled, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump, pump, I'm giving it to the kids, pump, pump, I'm giving it to my girls".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it understates the "concern" over the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Rather than having their babies stolen from them within days of giving birth, they, like us, must conceive and give birth to produce milk".
The LV breast pump fits perfectly into the breastplate.
Another commented: "It is understandably unpleasant for both mother and child.
But why don't they use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to keep their babies?"
Another commented: "That's a stupid ad".
Others defended the ad, with one woman saying she found the song "ridiculous".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'll have one if I'm still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad sounds a little silly, but I know what it means.
This is an intelligent product", wrote another.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad targeted at mothers who are breastfeeding (often in their workplaces or toilets) and who think of themselves as 'the customers.'"
This is not a commercial that praises or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women's group shows them all dancing with this clever pump inside their nipples.
The idea behind this ad is that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
However, the LV pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and fits snugly into a breastplate, allowing women to move around, hold their babies, and move around during pumping.
Mother's partner and EED, Anna Balerin, commented: "The LV pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and socially conscious introduction.
By announcing a parallel drawing between women and dairy cows, we wanted to showcase the unique sense of freedom that the new pump will provide in a fun and informative way, bringing to light all the challenges of breastfeeding and the challenges it presents.
This is not the first time that the Elvish pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two models used the product to model for designer Martha Jakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children being held has risen sharply, with monthly border crossings remaining relatively stable as a result of harsh weather and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants, who fear that offering to have a child would threaten their ability to stay in the country.
The risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other senior members of their household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that dozens of people who applied for orphaned minors' sponsorship were arrested by the agency.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the members of the sponsors' or sponsors' households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminals who have fled the country.
"We will continue to track them", said Mr. Albans.
In an attempt to arrange the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that, according to the detention center staff, require some of them to be held in custody for 60 days instead of the previously adopted one and appear in court within a month.
Many people will appear in person rather than via videoconference to request legal status for their case before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit to receive relief are immediately deported.
According to detention center workers and reports emerging from the process over the past few months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent riots or escape attempts.
Advocates said the problems were exacerbated in a larger location such as Tornillo, where a child may not show signs of aggression because of its size.
They said that taking children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can complicate the trauma many already have.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish 'reserved forces'
The war in the country is now in its eighth year, but Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem has also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, speaking to the UN General Assembly.
Foreign troops were illegally present on Syrian territory under the guise of fighting terrorism, and "they will work on that in the future", said Maulalam, who also serves as deputy prime minister.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the General Assembly.
More than 360,000 people have been killed and millions more displaced since 2011, and the war on terror is "almost over", he said.
He said that the Damascus state would continue this holy fight "until all terrorists of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign residences" are removed from the Syrian territory".
There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are over 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
Maulaam claimed that the situation was good enough for them to return on the issue of refugees, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that led refugees to leave.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these benefits", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in Idlib, the former rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks, UN ambassadors say.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army on the province of three million people.
However, Moullam stressed that the agreement had a "clear timeline", and expressed confidence that military action would "eradicate" jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda.
UN Ambassador Stephane de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the documents of the current constitution", Maulalam, on behalf of the Syrian government, imposed conditions on the committee's participants and warned against interference.
Why would Trump win a second term?
If his presidency is not ended prematurely by impeachment and scandal, as many liberals hope, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020.
The president's speech was followed by a speech by the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy.
At this point, the visitors show no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen reports, Fox News's average prime-time viewership has dropped to 2.4 million from an average of 1.7 million four years ago, while NBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the largest cable ratings of all time, with 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.

And you're in a situation where you've gone beyond the average person who waits six hours for a debate by an expert witness on the use of "deep background" by Bob Woodward as a source for his book "Fear", Paul Manfort's $15,000 oyster-skin bomb jacket ("a flashy suit", the Washington Post said), and Storm Daniels's chilling account of Mr. Trump's passage.

The most intense midterm election contest will be a cash flow.
It's no surprise to see a cash flow in Pennsylvania's 17th District thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district that has two leaders from the same race running for the same seat.
The Democratic representative from the suburban Pittsburgh district of Montgomery County, who won his seat in a special election last spring, recently withdrew from the race.
Lamb is in a tight battle with another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which is in sharp conflict with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally aligned in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th race has been a campaign finance stitch between the main party's financial army, the Democratic Business Congress Committee (DBCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a dramatic victory in a special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district that many were watching.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The Democrats have been pushed into a corner by political pundits.
The United States has returned the amount of fines imposed on El Salvador for supporting China.
The Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a slight setback with Washington, diplomats said.
Mr. Trump had a warm discussion with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and managed a hotel in Panama until partners removed the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan further", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support, was considered as fines against El Salvador.
The proposed fines, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will have a very severe impact on this Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, a similar meeting aimed at preventing migrants from entering the United States was followed by a high-level summit aimed at security and economic prosperity by North American and Central American officials.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that the summit should move forward, with no effective conclusion to any considerations of sanctions for El Salvador.
As a sign of announcing administrative locations for the meeting, Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to address the summit in mid-October, diplomats said.
Meanwhile, without further strong messages or sanctions from Washington, three US ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats, and agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
An external analyst close to the administration confirmed their accounts and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a book that is full of truth.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's obstruction of justice could be the next shot, and there is now very significant evidence in the public record of that.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the attack on our election.
If the Congress is transferred, Mr. Trump will be prepared to go before the electorate and a jury of his peers, and he will face accountability for the organization.
There are many possible outcomes, and I do not mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and they will affect how long the fight may last.
Only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich, in 1938 German officials were prepared to launch a coup against Hitler.
We failed, and we missed a chance to prevent years of murder.
The course of history revolves around such definite points, and the inevitable advance of democracy is swift or slow.
Americans are now facing a number of these paradoxes.
What if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rodrossenstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a precarious position since this article reported that he proposed secret recordings of the president's conversations last year and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is inaccurate.
"If the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony - how will we respond?"
Above all, should we vote midterm for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be dormant for a long time.
But I believe that the lesson I learned in Prague is that we will not fail.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and sent me away after 60 years to light a Sabbath candle on the same table that held the swastika.
It's my legacy, and how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna collision.
After an impressive win in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a win over the Austrians putting them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance was unable to make his first appearance of the season due to a knee injury until the Villa were level 2-2 but he believes this can be used as a springboard for the Rangers to move into the top tier.
"It was a good thing for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could win something and came back with something.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but overall, no wins and no losses was a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
By Thursday, it will be another great European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it will be a tough match because of their good results in the final, but with the people behind us, I believe we can go forward and get a good result.
With everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes in society that have taken place, the last year has certainly been very difficult, but there's a factor that makes it feel good now.
The squad is good and the players in the team really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully, after the last tournament, we can now move on and succeed".
This fear of retirement savings keeps women awake.
The survey participants had a clear idea of how to care for themselves, but few had discussed it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to negotiate", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
We should start here.
Talk to your spouse or children: Your family cannot prepare you for care unless you give them your consent in advance.
Since that choice can be a significant factor in determining the cost, work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a financial value to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own money as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts.
Keep a healthcare pre-class with you, so you can nominate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals are in line with your wishes when you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider preparing a power of attorney for your money.
You will be selected by a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Remember these small details: Imagine that your aging parents are being rushed to the hospital for an emergency.

A man was shot several times with a gas rifle in Ilfracombe.
A man was walking home at night when he was shot several times with an air rifle.
The victim, a 40-year-old man from Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 GMT, was described by officials as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attackers.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called for witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to communication disruptions, relief officials have been unable to receive any information from the Donggala area north of Palu City, near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some highlights of the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck just as the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongola is a region stretching for more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) along the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main parts of the economy in Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is largely concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, the Palau and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific earthquake zone and is prone to frequent earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years include:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake struck off the western coast of Aceh Province, East Sumatra, Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast were killed, more than half of them Aceh residents.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami hits the southern coast of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the capital city of Padang, West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake strikes one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Pidi Jayia region of Aceh, causing devastation and terror by reminding people of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami disaster.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died when buildings collapsed.
2018: More than 500 people were killed by a massive earthquake on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been arrested on charges of assaulting Palin.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Cavalry, a 29-year-old Palin suspect from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, tampering with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he took her phone when a woman known to report alleged crimes tried to call the police.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su pretrial compound, and he is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was questioned and said he was "certainly not guilty", the network reported.
Palin faces three class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also convicted of a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Supreme Court of Alaska.
He was charged in January 2016 with domestic assault, interfering with a reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by grassroots groups for linking her son's violent behavior to a PTSD condition caused by serving in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The tsunami caused by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake has destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not handed down in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Sipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to overtake pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path along a freeway on the West Side of Lower Manhattan in October.
To justify the death penalty, the intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York would require the prosecution to prove that Sipov "intentionally" killed all eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both counts carry the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter, a practice commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime trials, and the brutal and destructive use of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", and the manner in which Saipov carried it out was described by the accusers as "brutal, cruel and disgraceful".
"By Cifulilo Habbulevik Sipow, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decadette, Darren Drake, Ariel Arledge, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucco, the families and friends of whom he was a friend were beaten and injured", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last death sentence was carried out in a trial in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal trial in New York to carry out the death penalty was in 1953, two years before the couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saypov, a Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators that he did the right thing.
According to the indictment, Saypov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Sipow, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than a life sentence without the possibility of parole will be a lasting shock to all involved in this incident", Patton said.
The defense team of Saipov had earlier asked the accused not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MPs say Brexit talks should be left to Nigel Farage
At a protest at the Tory conference today, Nigel Farage threatened to "lead the People's Army forward".
The former Iranian leader - who said politicians should feel the 'warmth' of Eurosceptics - suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU, while Theresa May's own MP suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bohn said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would have 'left' by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the Tory Reckman has highlighted the challenge she faces in coming to terms with her long-divided positions by joining a separate opposition to Brexit City.
Amid the attacks of Brexiters, savers and the EU, the Prime Minister is trying to keep her peace plan in place.
Allies insisted she would go ahead with a deal with Brussels despite the setback and push the anti-EU and Labour Party to choose her package and 'confusion'.
Mr. Bon, speaking at a rally called Live Means Live in Solihull, said he wanted to 'cut the chicken' off.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a peer and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had become a steward, we would have left by now", he said.
The MP for Wellingborough also said: 'I am in favour of Brexit but we have to cut the diamonds.'
He said: "We did not fight the world wars to surrender.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people want to change their minds and stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march, telling reporters: 'I'm simply saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The use of the baton is not popular among the general public, and the opposition does not expect to vote for it, in fact it is not popular among our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please put down your gloves and start listening.'
In a letter to this lady, she stated: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs by keeping promises.'
If politicians are prepared to betray the decision they made in the 2016 referendum, they should be prepared to feel the 'warmth', Farage said at the rally.
"It is now about building trust between us - the people and our political class", he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to warm up our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We will continue to lead the people's army of this country that gave us victory over Brexit and will never give up until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those who preferred to stay traveled through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Since the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists have been turning to the Tories against the Brexit banner.
The Labour Party's contemporary Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives in a party application at the start of the convention over the security concerns they faced.
"These are the people who tell us that seamless IT systems can be implemented for borderless duty-free trade in Ireland and all technology etc for Canada", he said.
It's a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to focus on running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "be very focused on running for president" after the November election.
The Massachusetts Republican spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, reports the Boston Globe.
Warren, a consistent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP Republican Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has moderated speculation that she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting using the city level since Trump took office.
One of the audience asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded by stating that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that includes a woman in the top job".
Sims was arrested for the shooting death of a man at LSU.
LAPD in Baton Rouge, LA announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old DeTian Simpson was arrested at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a person in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed Friday morning outside Southern University.
"Wade Sims ultimately died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wade was shot by Simpson while trying to protect his friend.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to possession of a weapon and shooting Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and turned over to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: the World Championship is approaching after teams ordered Lewis Hamilton to hand the victory to Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valter Botas qualified Saturday over Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team will play a big role in the race.
From the end, Botas got off to a good start and defended his spot in the first two rounds, not allowing Hamilton to score any points and inviting Vettel to launch an attack on his teammate.
Wettle was the first to act decisively and Hamilton was the first to lead the team in the chase.
Mercedes then came a lap behind Wettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a fierce race, and seeing this Ferrari reluctantly kept the driver free inside and avoided the risk of passing two to defend third place.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the system and finished seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then stayed in the race for a quick finish and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place, he was ahead for a large part of the race.
He finally entered the race in the 44th round but was unable to improve speed in the remaining eight rounds, and Ryokan finished fourth.
It was a tough day and Valter did a wonderful job all weekend and as a true gentleman asked me to pass.
"The team has done such an extraordinary job to get one second", Hamilton said.
It's really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for not leaking a letter from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accusing him of sexual harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "lower and mean and false".
"One of the things that could happen in the last few days in the Senate, and the beautiful thing that's happening, is that when you see anger, you see people who are angry and mean and mean and lying", he said.
"When you look at the exits and exits, they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release it?
Remember her answer... did you hand over the papers?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't fire him".
Well, wait a minute.
"We're not fired", he continued in a senator's style.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein outlining the allegations against Kavanaugh, which was left in early September - but Feinstein denied it came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not release her story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked".
But her refusal did not seem to suit the president, who said during a rally on Saturday night: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she's not, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
Defending the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the baseness, the ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control", the president's statement said.
Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3 in the Elite League
Pantswear scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Winning the relegation game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday, the Dundee Stars reclaimed their Elite League title after a defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday.
With the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier, the Giants have scored two goals in the opening period.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the bar for the hosts before Dwyer filled the gap for the Giants.
Lucas Lundwald equaled François Bouchard Dundee before Nelson defended his victory with two goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who were looking to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams in the tournament, and the Giants won their previous three games.
At 3:35 in the fourth minute, Dwyer, with the help of Kendall McFaul, entered the field with the starter David Rutherford to help the Buellers double the gap.
In a busy opening period, Matt Markward took over as Co-host of the game at 15:16 before Sullivan returned to the hosts at 13:10.
When he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter, Dwyer made sure the Giants had the lead for the first half.
The host team regrouped and Butchard again brought it down with a power play ball at 27:37.
Cowne and Charles Corcoran helped Neilson lead Dundee for the first time late in the second quarter and he secured the win with his team's fifth-half lead in the final quarter.
The Giants, having lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home field in Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller, who was trying to ensure that hundreds of passengers survived the earthquake, died.
An Indonesian air traffic controller who died while trying to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off is considered a hero.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continues to be hit by strong aftershocks, with many people trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Guwan Agung refused to abandon his duty at the fast-swinging control tower at the Muezzim Syed Al-Jufri airport in Muezzim.
He was waiting to make sure that the flight 6321 of the Batik Air was safe to land on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower, thinking it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
The decision, according to Indonesia's aviation operations spokesman Johannes Sireit, has saved hundreds of lives, ABC News in Australia reported.
We have arranged for a helicopter to fly him from Balikappan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were heartbroken to learn about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigyi and Butong is restricted.
"The number is believed to continue to rise as many bodies are still in ruins and many are not accessible", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated the city, and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in a body", said Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, to Sky News.
Clean water is scarce.
"The small markets everywhere are being looted".
"The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what the outcome will be", said Jan Gelfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia visited the city of Palu on Sunday and told the Indonesian military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the rescue operations.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crashes, one person missing in a crash in the Gulf, says New Guinea Airlines
The airline, which operated a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously said it had rescued all 47 people and crew safely from the sinking plane, but now says one is missing.
Air New Guinea issued a statement saying it could not be held responsible for the death of a single male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information, such as the passenger's age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Seven people were taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
As of Saturday, six passengers were in hospital and all were in good condition, the airline said.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
Both the Air Force and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane failed to target the runway.
"The plane came from a very low altitude", said American pilot Bill Jans.
"It's a very good thing", said Janes.
"I was able to walk through the chest-to-chest water to the emergency door of the sinking ship", said Janes.
He said the flight attendants were screaming in fear and had minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade a steamer also helped bring people to shore using a windbreaker before the ship sank 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered plane crashes in the past two decades, but nothing has happened to Air New Guinea.
An analyst traces the nightly timeline of women brought back to life.
In 2014, the prosecution proved its case at a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the traveling parts of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Contrary to earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed she was with Teles Chambers the evening of her death.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to call Sanford.
Sanford came into the station on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecution if Tellis' claim that he was in Sanford's truck that night was true, Sanford said, "My truck was in Nashville, so he's lying".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis may have deleted Chambers's text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The final arguments in the defense are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected to refer the case to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
It takes a hip-hop trio to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group Highbreed says hip-hop is moving away from its political message to address social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Loki.
Another black man?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for expulsion after a "racist" text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory eviction after receiving a misleading text message from their mother complaining of "another black man".
The couple denies being racist and liken the case to "forced kidnapping".
Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, and Giselle Morris, a new child care provider, were shocked when they learned she was black on her first day at work in 2016.
"No more black people", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, "concerned" by her late mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that an African-American woman had done a bad job of caring for the children leaving the service and hoped instead to be a Filipino.
Ms. Morris was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber taxi.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal, and for $350 a day for the six months she was originally hired without a contract.
"I know it's discriminatory", she told Post on Pride, "and I want to show them that it's not something they should do".
The couple have responded to accusations that they are racist by saying that firing Morris was the only reasonable thing to do, fearing that they could no longer trust her after her conviction.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", the owner, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But even if you make mistakes, would you want to put your children in the hands of someone who has responded harshly to you?
Your newborn baby?
Look at this".
Comparing the case to "money laundering", Plasco said his wife had been out of work for about two months after the baby was born and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you go after someone like that?
It's not a very good thing to do", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still pending, and the People's Court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers feared that readers would not care about a talking bear, according to a new article.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult for someone else to understand the thoughts of a first-time reader before they are published.
It's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's enormous success".
Her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, said he would have been disappointed if his work was rejected, calling the 60th anniversary of the book's publication "a mixed one" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "the most important member of our family", she said that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not a boastful man", she said.
"But because Paddington was such a special person to him, it's almost like having a child who you can accomplish something with: it's not something you actually did, but you're proud of them.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
"Though it was his invention and imagination, he always used to pay tribute to Paddington".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye by phone.
Immediately after landing, her daughter was admitted to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life, but to no avail.
"Nad regularly called and said it was really bad and she was not expected to recover", said Ms. Ednan-Laperos.
"Then I received a call from Nad telling me that she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
And then I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be right there.
The medication the doctors had given her to operate her heart was slowly draining out of her body system.
She had just died and this was the closing of it all.
Knowing that this was all about to unfold, I had to sit there and wait.
I couldn't scream or mourn or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to put up with it".
Finally, Mrs. Edna-Laperos, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the seriousness of her situation.
"No one knew", she said.
"I kept my head down, tears running down my eyes the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women post suicide prevention cards on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries have posted cards with messages of comfort and phone numbers for people to call for help on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, had suffered from depression since he was 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I would not want any parent to suffer the way I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, said that her son was always smiling and had aspirations to be a chef.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up any room".
However, he was "in a really dark place" and had to give up work before he died.
In 2014, Tyler, then 11, was found dead in his home by his brother's suicide.
"I am constantly worried about my fate", said Mrs. Davis.
Ms. Davis designed the cards, "even if it's about a friend, to let people know that you have people you can go to and talk to.
"You must not be silent - you must speak".
Humphries, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He never said he felt a breakdown or depression or anything", she said.
"We noticed a change in his attitude a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - he didn't look at the children's faces or do anything else when they opened their presents".
She said his death was a huge shock to them, but they needed to cope: "It left a gap in the family.
It'll turn us on our side.
But we all need to keep fighting".

As the FBI begins the investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance.
"I thought, in fact, if we could get something like what he asked for - a time-limited, scope-limited investigation - we could have reached a little bit of a consensus", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "crumble" amid a strong loyalty standoff.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was almost entirely due to time.
With only five weeks to go until the November 6 midterm elections - if the Republicans do poorly as expected, efforts to nominate the person they want to the nation's highest court will be severely undermined.
George W. Bush has received phone calls from House senators asking them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
A vote will be held in the 51-seat Senate with 49 Democrats and Republicans.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to secure at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the peerage and be elected to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees is "falling".
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byung-seok said there were 1,127 displacements last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons for this were the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high fees charged by human traffickers.
The Pyongyang administration has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of those fleeing from the North are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
The Seoul government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is easier to cross, and across China, which has the longest border with North Korea.
China treats convicts as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Over the past few months, relations between the North and the South, who are still technically at war, have developed significantly.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that began with the postponement of nuclear talks.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on comprehensive terms for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But since then, the lack of progress has been blamed on US sanctions by Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho.
"Without any confidence in the United States, our national security cannot be trusted, and under such circumstances, there is no path to unilateral disarmament of our first", Mr. Deere said in an address to the UN General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the court.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview at the Texas Tribune event in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't control it, but imagine if a woman ever behaved like that, they wouldn't call her 'crazy,'" Pelosi said Thursday, referring to her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kawano was very emotional, and at times discussed his family and his high school days, almost crying and gasping for breath.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he has made himself unfit by those statements and the way the Clintons and Democrats have been chased", she said.
When asked if Kavanaugh would seek impeachment if his conviction was upheld and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi was skeptical.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, I say he not only doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court, he doesn't deserve to be on the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Since he was considered a moderate judge, Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was also concerned about Kavanaugh's ability to pass the Affordable Care Act or rule against Roy V. Wade.
During his confirmation hearing, Kawano skipped questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time to expect a crazy, biased person to go to court and tell us 'it's not fair,'" Pelosi said.
And women must control it.
It was a valid criticism that sowed months and years of anger, and she couldn't get it without mourning.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "A woman who was a CEO and who helped me a lot told me that when she was angry, she cried, but when she was angry, she could tell the person she was talking to, 'You can imagine I'm crying because I'm sorry.'"
I'm pissed off".
Then she moved on.
And I thought it was great".
Because they are basically misunderstood, tears have been given space as a way to vent anger.
One vivid memory of my previous job is when I was working in a male-dominated office, where I was always a little scared, and I was crying in my unspeakable rage, when a white woman, a security manager, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will be happy to see you sad and to make you sad".
Patricia Shoder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Shoder, deeply disappointed, realized that there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she said, laughing with me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was another one.
"Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
She was late in raising funds because the campaign was already over, so she vowed not to enter the contest unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her sponsors who had given men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotions - expressing gratitude to the people who supported her, raising money and fighting against the system that made it harder to target voters than candidates - that held her breath - like anger at sexism.
"You might think I was in shock", Ms. Schroeder recalled of the media's response to her.
"You may think that Clinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my grave?"
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing's control
The initial overtones of the US-China trade war were deafening, and experts say a dispute between the countries at a time when the war is far from over could benefit Beijing's control in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A significant shift has taken place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, with tariffs affecting half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has been repeatedly attacked in this way, and what has recently happened is that it has imposed a five to 10 percent tariff on $60 million worth of American goods.
China has also vowed to adapt to the US blow, and the world's second largest economy is not ready to leave anytime soon.
Washington's retreat means compliance, but publicly bowing to the United States is a disgrace to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressure could be beneficial to China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"It's actually more dangerous than those who were waiting to see it happen that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic collapse in either country", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mawlum said the situation in the country was improving.
"Thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the country today is more stable and secure", he said.
The government is continuing reconstruction efforts to restore areas devastated by terrorists.
The refugees who have been forced to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods are now in a position to return voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maulalam said the Syrian regime appreciates the support for the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe is set to win the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States have lost six straight games on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Denmark captain Thomas Bjorn's team won the European title again as they reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The most hard-working American of the tournament, Phil Mickelson, has taken his first shot at the par-3 16th hole, handing his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his tournament rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The lowest-ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjørn Olsen, defeated American Jordan Spieth 5 and 4.
World's top player Dustin Johnson, who is believed to have played his last Ryder Cup, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter.
Eight-time Ryder Cup champion Sergio Garcia of Spain became the all-time European winner of the tournament with a career score of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't stop myself.
This has been a busy year.
Thank you so much, Thomas, for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very, very happy to be able to get the Cup back.
It's a team effort, and I'm happy to be able to help with it", said Garcia, who was emotional after the European victory.
He hands the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who eliminated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's singles.
"Beating Tiger Woods makes me feel incredibly proud, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a professional Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus, an odd record for one of the greatest players of all time.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-performance golf throughout the entire tournament, the United States went to great lengths to find a boat every weekend.
US captain Jim Furyk, speaking after the disappointing performance of his squad, said, "I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a sort of European tour.
We lost.
Thomas is in our sights.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
Let's get back together, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I'm a fan of the 12 and proud to be their leader.
You should say hello.
"We were overtaken".
