It was in late 2017 when Siminoff appeared on the QVC television shopping channel.
Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement with a competing security firm, the ADT Corporation.
Although evidence suggests that an experimental vaccine is capable of reducing mortality from Ebola, to date no drug has clearly demonstrated its ability to treat the infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in this area, but other formal studies indicated that it had less of a benefit than expected in preventing mortality.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, that is, the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other drugs with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's charter and accepts the imperative need for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, could be better served by looking to the future with a significant change within our organization, rather than withdrawing the certification.
USA Gymnastics is supporting an independent investigation that could clarify how abuses of the dimensions so boldly described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone unnoticed for so long and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics as a sport, as well as others, as safe as possible so that female athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.
It was during the 1960s that Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy in an advisory capacity and, subsequently, for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory already widely held) and also provides other data that fossils generally do not provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal's feathers were brown on top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also offers insight into how feathers evolved in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed cannon, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers (beards and barbels), researchers have deduced that the rachis probably represents a later evolution of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or as ornamentation. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen features adult plumage and not feathers from a young offspring.
The researchers suggested that although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the specimen has adult plumage and is not the plumage of a young child.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They discovered that the Sun follows the same basic principles as the rest of the stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is governed by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a stellar Rossby number, related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the activity of the star in relation to the magnetic reversals.

The work was fundamentally theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts its attraction on the Milky Way galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as much as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is composed of many small particles.
TV reports show white smoke rising from the plant.
Local authorities are warning residents in the vicinity of the plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not drink water from the pump.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely worrying and cause for alarm, due to its extremely high mortality rate".
It's possible that some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, in Dr. Moll's opinion, and at least two of them were health care workers there.
After a year, one infected person may infect 10 or 15 of their immediate contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the whole group with TB still seems low; 6,000 out of a total of 330 000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

In France, voting has traditionally been an experience with little technological presence: voters walk into a voting booth and insert a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the chosen candidate into an envelope.
Once officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registration.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedure very strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can check that no ballot has been entered at the beginning of the vote, nor are envelopes added, except those of voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each and every part of the process.

Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused respond to the names of Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki explained that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with murdering his son.
He is being held pending arraignment and trial, but any witness evidence could be altered due to the widespread publication of his image.
This is common practice in the UK, but Scottish law works differently and the courts have found that the publication of the photos was potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University points out that journalists seem to be following a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects
The Crown Office, which generally handles the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is formalised.
The document, according to the leak, will reference the border dispute, which the Palestinians demand to be based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics allegedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to maintain that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control test would be closely monitored by guards during the monitoring of the test and the evaluation of its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation were given extensive guidelines and safety training.
Martelly invested yesterday the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine people.
It's the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to widespread protests against the regime that began in October with the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the inability to hold elections, some of which had been pending since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod overheating failures have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it had 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling it "truly regrettable" that Apple delayed the report.
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that no tsunami notification was recorded.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A large number of hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released in the first instance, as well as the photographers from the Philippines.
Later, the photographers were exchanged for an elderly woman who needed to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a tocolist and began work at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if the hormone was given, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered the two flight recorders - the "black boxes".
Fellow fighters also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first representative, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons, something extraordinary, almost like her.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even more so... and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her view during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the respondents share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme ends of the survey, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to problems with his fitness he is in the air.
He couldn't take the medication he needs to cope with the pain because it's forbidden in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever.
Numerous people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, which was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the origin of the arrival of water on Earth along with organic matter that can create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and lies".
Rumor has it that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save billions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being offered and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley; parking and park-and-ride are not available on the surface.
Fears of a lack of transportation opened the possibility that the game would be held behind closed doors without the team's attendants.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden pointed out that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have lasted much longer due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch (geospiza forte) and a Spanish cactus finch (geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be turned into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and glued to other metals. Its thickness can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings, called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance.
The cabbage changes color depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H of the pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then with clean, moist hands mold them into a ball.
The moisture from the hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had cisterns in practically every house, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewer systems have been found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets also existed. In Roman civilization, toilets sometimes formed part of public bathhouses, shared by men and women alike.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back almost immediately.
A rocket launched the satellite into space, and scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere is part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, and the most important thing it has done for us is provide us with easier and faster modes of transportation.
We have the train, the car, and many other forms of transportation.
Below these, more medium-sized cats are found feeding on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat much larger amounts of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the idea of the niche, a specialized job that each cat has assigned and keeps them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the cats and live in large groups, called herds.
Herds consist of one to three adult males who are related, along with up to thirty females and pups.
Females are often related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act very similarly to a wolf or dog, animals surprisingly similar to lions (though not to other big cats) in their behaviour and also highly deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can gait (although not very well), swim, jump long distances, and throw with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is included in the same group ("genus panthera") as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not the same as a lion's roar, but rather a phrase with words scrawled in screams.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find prey using their sense of smell, sniffing where they have moved on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by mixing with their surroundings to jump on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, they cross a mountain range or a river, or they go to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from where they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be until then.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it also begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that we humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we can exhale (that is, expel by our breath).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our houses with plants and we also make clothes with them, most of the food we eat is also sound, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the ultimate predator of its time and was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long chin was adorned with over 70 sharp teeth like those of a knife, plus an additional set of teeth at the base of its mouth, meaning that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We can't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a bipedal tongue, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-rex would not be a match for it.
While most of their foods would seem familiar to us, the Romans had a handful of items for the feasts that were unusual or unusual, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called a hedgehog.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could recline on one side while eating.
Ancient Roman lunches could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coconut, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered to be the home of that deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard and, subsequently, an inner sanctuary that only priests may enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called "ziggurats", were sometimes erected to integrate into the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew families was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the tents were simple open counters that faced the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the region of Canaan there were no major forests, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for committing a murder and, while traveling west, to have found a territory which he named Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes had been living there since then.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many distinctions between the people, the kings, the traditions and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Hunt, you probably think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct, and even if there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, this document was kept in a large-sized (29⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) scroll.
So it's likely that this annotation was just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still overrun.
It was ruled by Vichy France, the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward the Germans.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a sizeable group of people living and working cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, relative to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which also to some extent defines the size of a society.
Cities are the origin of nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is passed on through different generations, a lasting cultural remnant and considerable dissemination.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations of their own.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed solely of Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes and, with no national executive or legislature for the enforcement of all its laws, was dependent on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate.
Nor did he have the authority to invalidate tax legislation or interstate tariffs.
The articles required unanimous approval by all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national team, along with Germany, are the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Some popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheel hockey and Formula 1 competition.
Winter sports enjoy more popularity in the northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
It has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its island group, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, thus initiating the transformation of the production practices of the aboriginal grain and giving employment to Chinese laborers who worked on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Winds.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu's restoration had been completed, and the work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photographic image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It still occurs today, but more importantly is the aspect ratio that the image sensor formats of digital cameras inherited.
The 35 mm format, in fact and for confusion, measures 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So, the aspect ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio is divided by twelve) is said to be 3:2.
Different common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The oft-quoted and often ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a little bit of order in an image.
It states that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under attack.
For thousands of years, Christianity united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its dominant power in all areas affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the elementary principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the relief of suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been Rome for a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this pious piousness was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting vital civilian and military supplies, although this blockade violated the generally accepted international law codified by many international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain has sown mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horror and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to prevent a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to live in the United States of America where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter in which he was recommended by Charles Batchelor (his last job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China there was a unique method of showing the different time periods; each era of China or each family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, there was a bloody war between different nobles who were trying to get the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of dead people fighting to sit at the highest position in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even so, after the Revolution, the occupations were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and determined to achieve success.
It's the same with the military, because the ranks of the army have become based on rank, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters related to the beyond of this mundane life, and he often went to a cave that came to be known as "Hirana" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to do contemplation.
That same cave, which has survived the passage of time, provides an intense picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on one of the mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find out at all if one knew it existed.
You can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures that were built in honor of the death of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu while a number of other pyramids, tombs and temples of smaller size were built in honor of the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The upper arch mark resembles a V and the lower arch marks a clamp or square, missing the lower half.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, while down means you should start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow normally produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notations, but don't forget that the printed marks in the bow are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young sons (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4), as well as the king's sister, Madame Isabelle, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to take the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob ripped off the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the extraordinary benefits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history comprising the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by general convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological impulse or technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass vehicle ownership also generates a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geographical context emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of that society, turned out to be better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the cradle of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status was declining during the 12th century, due mainly to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital changed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the period between the 10th or 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, resulting from the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence farming is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses native seeds kept for subsistence combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of all these factors.
Members of a subculture often make their association apparent through distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, manner, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the few unfortunate cases of boys who, through neglect, misfortune or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
Some wild boys have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these boys is due to the parents' rejection of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may experience severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were presumably raised by animals; some are said to have lived solitary lives far from civilization.
When raised by nonhuman animals, wild cubs exhibit behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to that of the particular animal that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, staging goes one step further.
A stajam is not a learning method but a tool that provides support to individuals who are undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
The stays can be both virtual and real, i.e. the master or mistress is a form of stays, but so is the clip in the form of a man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual images are embedded in the software and their purpose is to question, provoke and explain procedures that could be complicated for the student to face alone.
Children come into foster care for a wide range of different reasons, which can range from neglect and abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not enriching, affective and educational, but it happens.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for this little girl.
It's taken for granted that our foster care system provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
Foster adoption is supposed to provide all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The particular features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the focus of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continued relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements of a few milliseconds in duration.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect when a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to understand speech as a result of brain damage suffered are nevertheless able to determine sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these interpretative abilities of human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix up and down variations between the two reserves in each generation.
In the savanna, it's complicated for a primate with a digestive system like humans might have to meet its amino acid requirements from existing plants.
And the consequences of not doing so are serious: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large volume of protein that integrates all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a relatively similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and then falling back asleep shortly afterwards (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively silent alarm clock that helps you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find that you end up delaying the alarm clock without waking up, you can put it on the other end of the room, to force yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, forcing you to stand up to move.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present.
The only obstacle that stands between us and this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is part of the teachings of the Buddha, but these have been extended by the Mahayana path of love, as well as through many techniques of Indian yoga.
To start with, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to all-encompassing love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, through the visualization of the different deities the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are reactivated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, the clashes between systems, processes and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
After two years since the end of the war, the former allies have now become enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It would last for the next forty years and be fought in reality, through proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other different places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete overnight, when 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Russia-Poland Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain in the same way it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have first been domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise cattle to gain easy access to milk, fur, meat, and furs.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, in a manner similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These grazing methods are still used today.
Waggonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and to move heavier loads over the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The railings were introduced very early to secure the tracks in position, however, it gradually became apparent that the tracks would be much more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more severe wear than the wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels replaced iron wheels, and in 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known method of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus (meaning "man standing").
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join an environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it is equivalent to treating the symptoms, but if we don't want a solution that is purely temporary, we should go to the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is more than evident that the world has changed considerably as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances and that problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's excessive lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a couple of blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
That very night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the Dunlap Flyers.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. Another additional copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 known Dunlap scrolls are the oldest extant copies of this document. The original manuscript document has not survived.
Different paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
These birds have many features that are still very similar to those of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today start out by manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as vomiting, are so generic that it is impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household substances.
Refer to the label for the specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bicho" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term has its origins in the classic familiarity with bed bugs, insects with a great capacity for adaptation to parasitize humans.
Both redwoods and bedbugs are predators, adapted to living in their own nest or that of their host.
Across the United States of America there are approximately 40000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the child's best interests to raise a child.
These couples may choose to draw up an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works through scientific methods. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It's not just through experimentation, but experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was accepted in all matters relating to science, including psychology.
As the wisdom of the Greeks declined, the West became detached from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are nothing more than responses to external periodic patterns, in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free running even in the absence of external patterns.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the first to suggest that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their class, the relevance of the element of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline.
Only mutations in germline cells are susceptible to be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-centred tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural spaces to enjoy the landscape as well as the fauna and flora.
Examples of in-situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, as well as the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural villages by car to go to their workplace, crossing paths with others whose work destination is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone is somehow connected and supports the private vehicle-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massive coal-dependent economy has changed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two billion years.
We all participate in society and use transportation, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such a level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more elemental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of drivers and particular vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they maintain with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers often behave within reasonably consistent ranges; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be made an approximate mathematical representation.
To get a better representation of traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan and design traffic service operations.
Insects were the first to fly, and their ability to fly helped us to escape our enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the devil's knights and the ephemers.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others thought otherwise; the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
It makes sense, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and most flowing river on Earth, carrying eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the total water in the world's rivers that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed in size or technical superiority.
The ancient Egyptians of the new reign were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population density.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while in religious ceremonies Latin is often used.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized on the principle that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it was also theorised that they transform into new substances that give shape to what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more materials, and it's important to remember that the periodic table includes many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and uses.
Now people can type messages on computer screens without having to go near a stapler.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like dragging a heavy truck up the coast, and then when you split the core again, you release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The cork has a thickness of approximately 70 km at the nearest and 100 km at the farthest.
It is thinner below the sea areas and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more marl on the near side, because the bark is thinner, and the lava is easier to get to the surface.
Content theories focus on what motivates people or what is appealing to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured and became adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want certain things and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues: At one extreme they will try to remain "one more colleague".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and demanding accountability from people.
On the other side of the coin, you become an unrecognizable individual who believes you should change everything the team has done and adopt it as your own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual computers meet the same standards of excellence as conventional computers, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams will be able to meet depending on the different time zones, which the national management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the management group to which each member is accountable. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of setting up an organization that fosters learning?
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can give rise to a new innovation process that responds to customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as sharing knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method employed to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research, and so they narrow the area of research and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The spread of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides a wealth of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction overtones, it is an important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is looking for machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to patient diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These kinds of things have become independent disciplines, trying to provide solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently employed in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they have been integrated into multiple home software applications and video games.
Excursions are a very important part of any classroom. Often teachers would love to take their students to places that bus travel is not feasible.
Technology offers the solution through virtual school tours, where students can see museum equipment, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting at their desks.
Sharing a virtual school trip can also be a great way to reflect on the trip and shared experiences with other classes in the future.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the website is moved, but the previous versions are kept online to act as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing.While students often begin their blogging experiences by showing poor command of grammar and spelling, in general, the presence of an audience makes them change.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog editor begins to work on improving his writing and avoiding criticism.
Furthermore, keeping a blog "forces students to learn more about the world around them".[22] The need to feed the interests of the public inspires students to show their intelligence and be interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "enables students to become more analytical and critical; by offering an active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of what others have written, as well as their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's adorable bilingual capital, home to a selection of art galleries and museums where you can contemplate the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and many more make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider to be intrinsically Canadian.
Large areas towards the north are barely populated and many are virtually uninhabited wilderness areas.
Here's a comparison of populations that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent of its own in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated nations of France and are famous for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region settling deeply in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that women traveling here claim to be married, regardless of their marital status.
It may also be helpful to wear a wedding ring (which does not seem too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment and it is common for them to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Show your firmness in rejecting men and don't be afraid to assert your position (whether it's because of cultural differences or not, it's not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber seafarers in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants, who established trading bases there, gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as taxis, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and most of the streets of the city, particularly in the center, were buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be researched to learn about the state of the confrontation that still persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base from which to ascend to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
To travel around Goma, motorcycle taxis can be used, the normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for this short journey.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktu in English has become a metaphor for exotic and remote islands.
Today, Timbuktu is a very poor town, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and also has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a stark contrast to the rest of the country, due to its more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-west of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which maintains a different fauna and flora.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entry fees.
It is also likely to be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the entire territory and is the place that many tourists consider to be the most relevant.
The parade of buildings defining the skyline in Hong Kong was likened to a brilliant bar graph made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best panoramic views of Hong Kong, you'll have to leave the island and head to the Kowloon Pier on the opposite shore.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the north coast.
British settlers adopted this place as their own, so if you're looking for samples of the territory's colonial history, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of mangroves on the planet, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coastline of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest that is on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps: they include some of the last strongholds of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 chitais in the area.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (crossing the river) uninterruptedly throughout the day, but most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
As the buses between districts are usually full, it is recommended to buy the ticket in advance.
Most districts have the service of small Japanese Coaster buses, comfortable and solid vehicles.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient method to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 metres (275 ft), the bridge is 378 metres (1,220 ft) long and has two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The drawbridge under the bridge is 15 metres (50 ft) long. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now known as eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spaniards lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to largely retain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December in the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
There are also tournaments and smaller matches during other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, you can consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas Pound (FKP), whose value is set in equivalence to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is generally accepted on all islands and Stanley itself also accepts credit cards and US dollars.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and US currency will be accepted; owners should be consulted in advance to determine which payment method is most acceptable.
It is virtually impossible to exchange the Malvinas currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to make the exchange before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cool: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to cause a feeling of colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost unchanged throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to humans, they are wild animals that should not be fed or tamed.
The park management recommends keeping a minimum distance of 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wild animals.
Docile as they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries from not keeping a proper distance, and these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they must be given space.
Also, bear in mind that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of the infamous naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except a British cruiser, with about 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence, a peaceful demonstration in the city was ended by the assassination of the Tupua supreme chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because of its location between two harbours, Auckland has many beaches, the most popular of which are divided into three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are sandy beaches safe for swimming and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Bay, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are usually very busy family beaches with a good variety of tents along the coast.
The most famous local beer is the "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many types of French wine to choose from, but probably New Zealanders and Australians can handle travel better.
The water brought in locally can be safely drunk, but bottled water is easy to find in case of doubt.
For Australians, the idea of a "milk coffee" is alien. A coffee is just an "espresso", the cappuccino takes a layer of mounted cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate in the bowl meets Belgian expectations, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and reef injuries are rare.
However, the advice of the authorities should be followed, the signs be observed and special attention paid to safety warnings.
Cuboids are found near beaches and river estuaries between October and April in the north of 1770.
Killer whales do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most whales are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he has arrived at his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to or from the airport, or even combined airplane and hotel packages.
You can also save the reservation if you need time to assess the offer or look for other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
However, any modification or request should be handled in the first instance through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees choose to camp inside the festival itself and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
To get closer to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a camp near the music.
It should be remembered that even if the music ends on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music well into the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with younger girls.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during the winter, you should check the cabin location, as the crossing through the ice generates an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more.
The St Petersburg cruises include a stay in the city, and cruise passengers are exempt from having a visa (see conditions).
Usually, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They often have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and staying in the premises.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good players are aware of the importance of staying sober.
People who are going to drive at high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low, so you can't drive the way you would on normal asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to become trapped.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries and traffic is maintained virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest attraction for tourism in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to surface travel to see the impressive African wildlife, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, will come very close to cars, so a normal kit will allow for good vision.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so the best way to see them is through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a mountain-climbing safari, hiking safari, or walking safari) is a form of hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, things may get complicated.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March most coronavirus cancellations will not go beyond July 2020, the scheduled date of the Olympics.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with the average price of admission being around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels have irons and boards available for use, even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron is not available or you do not feel like putting the iron on your socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Do not let the material weaken excessively (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, you should consider buying the water in sealed bottles from an accredited company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases per se or dangerous animals with the ability to injure or kill people by force are generally not considered pests.
Shopping at Duty Free is an opportunity to purchase items free of excise duties and taxes in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont features the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the middle of nowhere.
If you are not used to driving on minor roads, take it easy: steep back roads, narrow lanes and tight corners are the most common.
The speed limits indicated are considerably lower than those of the front and rear sections (generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and their strict observance is even more important than the reverse.
However, it is curious that the mobile telephone service has more coverage here than in other sections of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pies are quite good and, in Bavaria, they are quite sweet and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbours: Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples cooked in the packages all year round, with cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German bakery products also include almonds, bees and other types of dried fruit. Popular biscuits often go perfectly with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to try some hard and consistent pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used to cook curry; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
However, employed without any other qualifier, the term usually means the typical food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a range of simple condiments, with the predominant flavours of Javanese favorites being peanuts, chiles, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and different aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet becoming trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged by the horse if he tries to escape. To minimize this risk, there are a number of safety precautions that can be taken.
First, most motorists wear boots with heels and a flat, rather narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle by being pulled back from it in case of a fall from the saddle.
The Cochamó valley, Chile's main destination for rock climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks have breathtaking views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world continually establish new routes between its walls of infinite potential.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular and involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity, with many followers, occasionally referred to as "skiing toddlers", planning entire holidays around skiing in one particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting female skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Hiking skiing: This activity is also called trail skiing, tourism skiing or hiking skiing.
It is related, although it does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, as the latter is done on sloped terrain and requires much tougher skis and boots.
You should think of the ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, slightly longer distances can be covered than on foot, but only occasionally will cross-country ski speeds be reached without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries would require applying for multiple visas and going through multiple passport controls.
However, the Schengen area in this sense functions to some extent as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, so you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured items are an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, in which the limit of antiquity may be lower in places like North America than it would be in Europe.
Craft products could be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar items produced on a large scale.
Reindeer farming is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture surrounding its trade is important for many other professions as well.
Even traditionally, not all Sami participated in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, caring for the reindeer primarily as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism is a major source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although its use is widespread, especially among non-Romanies, the word xitano is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the people.
If safety recommendations are issued for the country to which you are travelling, your health or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may want to consult the advice of governments in addition to your own country, but your advice is directed to your own citizens.
For example, it is possible that American citizens in the Middle East face different situations than those Europeans or Arabs might experience.
The alerts are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are generally superficial, general and overly simplified compared to the information more often available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a generic term for any type of dangerous atmospheric phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types, which will depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Wind gusts, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of extreme weather conditions, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Some regional and seasonal severe weather events include hail, snow, ice and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inform themselves of any severe adverse weather conditions that may affect their area, as this could influence their travel plans.
Anyone considering visiting a country considered a potential conflict zone should get professional training.
An internet search for a "hosted media course" will likely find the address of a local company.
A course will typically cover all the issues discussed here in greater detail, usually with practical activities.
A course will normally last between 2 and 5 days and will include role-playing games, many first aid exercises and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are less common.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for traveling back.
Governments' willingness to issue genderless passports (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with such documents also varies considerably.
Security check hacks also became much more intrusive after 9/11.
Transgender people who are pre-surgery will not be required to undergo scans to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Returns are the flow that returns from the waves after breaking against the shore, usually against a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of the groundwater, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and it is possible for a fast current to form towards the deep water from that point.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming again is no more difficult than usual.
You should try again in an area where there is no possibility of being trapped or, depending on your swimming ability and whether you have been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The return shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
By returning home after living abroad, one has already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of one's own.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed with travelers returning home.
The light and sound show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for the young girl.
The pyramids can be observed in the dark and contemplated in silence before the show begins.
Usually you hear the noise of tourists and vendors, the story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids, which are all illuminated.
Many countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819; these host the largest number of bases, with sixteen of them active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula that borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plain to then resurge and form the 360 km-long range of the Ellsworth Mountains, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, with Mount Vinson in the Vinson Range reaching 4,892 m (16,840 ft).
In remote locations without mobile phone coverage, satellite phone is likely to be the only possible option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outside with a direct satellite line to be able to make a call.
This service is frequently used for shipping, including leisure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice.
The local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan to take a sabbatical is to go on a journey and learn.
This is particularly popular among high school seniors, as it allows them to take a year off before entering college, without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical year abroad can actually improve the chances of accessing higher education in the home country.
Generally, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are undoubtedly large enough for any type of yacht, the smaller boats or even a kayak allow for a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is still quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one for every forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include an extension of the stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and sleep back on the boat at night.
If you only plan to land with the excursions on board, you will not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As seen on the above map, Berlin is far from the sea and city visits are not included in the cruise cost.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to feel ashamed about: it's not unlike the personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during flight may help them to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering items quickly. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for smaller companies this was a problem.
If they sent things by air mail, it could take several days for certain routes to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there sooner was to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations prohibit sending unchecked baggage, which is where you come in.
An obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have the company pay for it).
Yet, it is not cheap - as a rule, you could pay four times the price of a regular business ticket and up to eleven times that of first class!
In general, it is not worthwhile to look for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a select group of passengers who are willing to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of reaching their destination in a quick and convenient way, with the corresponding charge.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in western Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but no UN member states recognize it.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, with the second most important port after Istanbul and an excellent transportation hub.
In the ancient city of Smyrna, there is now a modern, sprawling, busy commercial center, framed around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are mixed with traditional red-washed roofs, the 18th century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European feel than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal plan church.
In the cemetery, interesting marble sculptures of doves can be seen on the tombstones.
It's worth a half-hour stroll through such an intriguing town.
To the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which was popularised among foreigners after Lord Byron's eulogistic description of its wonders.
Bus 403 from Scotturb travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (the sepulchre) is worth visiting, a center of worship world-famous for the apparitions of the virgin.
Remember that you're basically visiting a mass grave, as well as a place that has immeasurable significance to a huge proportion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived their passage through there and many more whose loved ones were murdered or worked to death there, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
This place should be treated with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
It is forbidden to damage the surroundings by painting marks or scratches on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Castilian. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, which most understand, and virtually everyone knows Castilian.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Castilian is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Normal announcements of the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide range of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although the best way to develop in Paris is still to behave and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-educated).
The abrupt exterior of the Parisians will quickly evaporate, if a few basic manners are displayed.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has a dense forest mass, mainly of beech, different types of spruce, such as the spruce and false spruce, and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a considerably wide variety of plant communities, due to its extensive range of microclimates, different soils and variety of altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here you can find exotic fauna such as European wild bears, wolves, eagles, mouches, lynxes, mountain cats and mountain otters, in addition to many other common species.
On visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts up to the knees and also cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries offer cloths for women who do not come unprepared, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover them up to the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the pile at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable or comfortable wearing those skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (pork, in particular) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular meal, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any available seasoning, for example, cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, with the word Sie meaning you, are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
It constitutes a significant way of differentiating between some verbs and objects.
In theory, it facilitates reading, although writing is, to some extent, complicated by the need to decide whether a verb or an adjective is used in a noun.
Pronunciation of Italian is quite easy since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to be watched out for are the c and the g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel below.
You should also make sure to differentiate the pronunciation of the r and the rr: caro means dear, while carro means animal-drawn vehicle.
Persian has a considerably simple and fairly regular grammar.
So, reading this basic grammar could help you learn a lot about Persian and understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you already speak some Romance languages, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people with some knowledge of Spanish might jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is similar enough that they do not have to study it separately.
The premodern observatories are generally obsolete today and are preserved as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, which were much easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes consist of gigantic facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The flowering of cherry trees, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants are most beautiful when they are in their natural environment, so you should resist the temptation to pick even a single speck.
When visiting a formal-designed garden, collecting "samples" will result in immediate expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit where it is very easy to get around; you can also buy virtually anything once there.
However, being in the high tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to both the (constant) heat and the intense sun (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses that head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you're thinking of taking is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a vacation on.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or cruise the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking or cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christendom, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter in a vigil in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely that it was a pre-Christian ritual to exalt spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold a paschal vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, after which congregations often break out in a celebration at the start of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands saw them swim, fly or bark.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, so the giant tortoise became the first grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you may experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This presents an excellent opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for practically 24 hours.
As those areas are barely populated and light pollution, therefore, tends not to be a problem, you can enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are a standard business attire, and co-workers address each other by their last name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is critical, highlighting the effort of the group rather than individual achievements.
Often, workers must obtain approval from their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to comply with their instructions without objection.
