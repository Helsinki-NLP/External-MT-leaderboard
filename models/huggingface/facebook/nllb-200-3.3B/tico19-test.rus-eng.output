Rapidly rising cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
Cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) countries and in the UK, confirming that, despite its different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase their preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, was responsible for the infection.
From this point on, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was called the coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild form of the disease, i.e., a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most people recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases progress to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, and in the remaining 6%, it becomes critical, requiring intensive care.
The death rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
The study analyses the cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with the trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with the data for Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the rest of the world is now experiencing a COVID-19 pandemic in the same dynamic as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO determining the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020  all three cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 deaths, were in Italy alone.
Determining the cumulative number and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country in the world, obtained from official sources such as the ministries of health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse the trends of COVID-19 spread in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
The cut-off cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days was calculated as an indicator of the level of spread of active cases of COVID-19 taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as of 8:00 on 15 March 2020, compared to the data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trends in truncated cumulative COVID-19 prevalence over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA and the UK were generally consistent with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (further material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have seen similar trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the corresponding figure for Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this data, the total number of cases already reported as of 8:00 am on 15 March in the 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number reported in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, different response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different patient selection rules for testing for COVID-19, including 'infiltration' testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients require intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already overcrowded.
Currently, data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available for only 6 and 1% of cases respectively (data not provided).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data to supplement current surveillance data on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-2011 found that there is a significant variation in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100 000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010/2011).
The sixth update of the ECDC's COVID-19 Express Risk Assessment outputs provides a modelling scenario of health system resource burden with estimated COVID-19 hospitalization data in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of available beds in intensive care units is over 90%.
As cases are currently grouped by specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a population of a specific territorial group, it is recommended that information on cases and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided as far as possible in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2) level 2.
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a SARS-CoV-2 contact scenario that persists for a long time, and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as seen in the affected regions of Italy, for example.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, an expeditious, proactive and integrated approach with a subsequent shift from containment to mitigation is important to contain SARS-COV-2 because, given the projected rapid increase in the number of cases, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to design, adopt and adjust their response accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short window of time in which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world at the moment, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving field of research.
We will look at the basic aspects of the epidemiology, the etiology, the virology, the diagnosis, the treatment, the prognosis and the prevention of this disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help us understand and eradicate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) which falls on January 25 in 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people, who have been urged to stay home for the entire festival and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 named this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease  coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the 'number one public enemy' and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
We will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other coronavirus-related diseases as much as possible, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which first appeared in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts that are currently known about prevention and prognosis, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens and are largely responsible for about 15% of all respiratory diseases 4.
However, we have seen two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses in this century, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries with horrific rates of morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first report of clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown origin was received by the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death in Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known that health workers had been infected, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, a quarantine was imposed in Wuhan, and public transport was shut down.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease found that 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to approximately 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
Given the rapidly evolving situation, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, the following updated epidemiological picture was presented (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA) from a multi-center clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19.
All age groups were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, but people aged 30 to 65 years were the most affected.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was spread by clusters mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, it took 5 (29) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.07.2) days.
The average time from onset of symptoms to death was 9.5 days (4.813).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.514.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.234.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infections, coinciding with the large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.101.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.024.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large envelope viruses containing a single strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
In the case of SARS and MERS coronavirus, the glycoprotein of the spiny outgrowth (S) binds to the cell receptors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA, together with the membrane glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new type of beta coronavirus, with a genome that is 99.98% consistent with 10 sequential samples collected in the first outbreak at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin slices of human respiratory epithelium by translucent electron microscopy.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human enzyme ACE2 less strongly than SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The protein orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play some role in terms of pathogenicity of the virus and suppress IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on the structure of the full-sized human enzyme ACE2 with a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which includes open and closed conformations, is assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in drug screening for suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans via civets and camels respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was determined that bats are the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unclear which species became the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Ji and his colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, in the process of homologous recombination in the S-protein.
Chinese Guangzhou scientists have suggested that pangolins  long-beaked mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine  are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this suggestion is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory settings, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 4050% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and heating to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents can effectively block the activity of the virus, but chlorgexidine cannot.
The human population as a whole does not possess immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so humans are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on the detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).4).
Typically, a host virus is first recognized by the innate immune system via pattern-recognition receptors (PROs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, due to N-protein, SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon an adaptive immune response kicks in to fight the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the body's defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
T helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell function, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an immune system overreaction causes a localized build-up of large amounts of free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario, lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
The chances of infection are higher for people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or have a compromised immune system.
According to the results of the study of the data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 37 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.
A later study described above, based on demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.07.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the timing of the quarantine measures introduced to the most accurate calculations of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected who are asymptomatic.
A 14-day quarantine for those who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus has become common practice.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and most common symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which may be the only symptom or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, dizziness, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/ or hypoxia within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory illness, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis even if there are no abnormalities on chest X-rays.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 found the following symptom prevalence: 98% high fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath, and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies of familial infections and transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals.
Similar results were obtained in a 2012 study of MERS-CoV patients, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required ventilation, a much higher rate than for COVID-19 patients, and corresponds to a higher rate of death from MERS than from COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%)
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99100 %), dry cough (2975 %), shortness of breath (4042 %), diarrhea (2025 %) and sore throat (1325 %), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required in 1420 % of patients.
As of 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 stood at 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the mortality from SARS by November 2002 was 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study had determined the baseline reproduction index (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 to be 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) within 5.717.23, whereas the R0 for SARS-CoV was only in the range of 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is provided in Table Table 1.1.
The above indicators suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher capacity to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, the containment of SARS-CoV-2 would be much more difficult than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster disease often occurs when the infection occurs within a family or in a group of people who have come together for some reason or who are in a group on a transport such as a cruise ship.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or had contact with infected or sick people in the last two weeks before the onset of illness.
However, reports indicate that people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and that cured patients can become carriers of the virus again after being discharged from hospital, and this is a worrying sign for the extension of the quarantine period.
In the early stage, patients have normal or decreased numbers of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L, including white blood cell count < 1×109/L, as well as elevated levels of aspragin-aminotransferase and viremia.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin, while most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood erythrocyte deposition.
In patients with severe disease, the levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin, in the blood were elevated and the number of lymphocytes steadily decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have had chest X-rays that show irregular blackening on both sides or blackening of the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory illness (ARID).
In the development of an acute respiratory syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis lead to significant impairment of gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and II pneumocytes lowers the surface-active compounds and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Thus, the worst results of the radiographic examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathology analysis demonstrated pneumocyte deposition, formation of hyaline membranes and intertissue lymphocyte infiltration, and the multicellular syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease, corresponding to the pathology of viral infection and ARV and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19 was the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high rate of false negative results, which could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from 13 February 2020 China began to diagnose based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
It was a similar situation with the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray findings is critical for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, a group of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methodology, based on the repetition of CRISPR, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a density of 20 × 1018 mol/l to 200 × 1018 mol/l (10100 copies per microliter of the original sample) by indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new technique, if it is successfully tested in clinical drugs, could significantly improve the sensitivity of the tests and the convenience of their execution.
Due to the lack of experience in treating a previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can generally only provide supportive therapy to COVID-19 patients, while attempting to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or suggested for treating other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapeutic approaches include current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered plasma, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs, and may also affect other ACE2-expressing organs to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and malfunction are the main threat and cause of death in patients.
Thus, supporting respiratory function is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-concentration oxygen delivery, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary blood flow technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, water-salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are of critical importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine storms are the result of a hyper-reaction of the immune system in patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammation that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ARD and multiple organ failure.
In treating cytokine storm, especially in patients in critical condition, immunosuppression is of paramount importance.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that act as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of the immune response to control T cells; blockade of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus kinase; and use of Blinatumab, cytokine signal 4 suppressants, and histodeoxyloarbutamate inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS viruses to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in low and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been shown to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided this compound to China for a paired study in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be associated with diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects.
Interaction with other medicinal products should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease has been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the healthy population for a long time.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
The antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target-neutralise them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and then injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation and viral load decreased, and their oxygen saturation increased.
However, to propose the widespread use of this method before the introduction of specific therapy, it is necessary to have not yet carried out the verification and not to have drawn up explanations.
In addition, some of the drawbacks of plasma should be carefully considered in the light of its therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, is potentially life-threatening.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It's not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
So it's more important and more practical to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and identify the genetic code of the active antibodies or to do a screening to find active antibodies against the critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go right to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an indeterminate effect, as it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of patients recovered from COVID-19 was in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the lowest recovery rate was recorded (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment must be made taking into account a host of other influencing factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western-only and Chinese-combined treatments.
They found that the time taken to normalize the body temperature, to eliminate symptoms, and to provide medical care in a hospital setting was significantly shorter in patients treated with a combination of Western and traditional Chinese medicine than in patients treated with Western medicine alone.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who experienced a worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine than in the group treated with Western methods only (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the first group than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more closely controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain a description of the mechanism of action and to explain the aspects of the efficacy of the components used in the techniques of traditional Chinese medicine, or their combination.
Patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are more likely to experience intense fear of acute and even fatal illness, and people in quarantine are also more likely to experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritability.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as treatment side effects such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause further anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric illnesses were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, can increase anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of the infection, quarantine, and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric support should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and contacts, and to all others who require it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary psychiatric support teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain outbreaks caused by novel viruses.
Work has been done on S-protein-based vaccines, which are intended to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed.
However, before clinical trials can be initiated, the efficacy of these potential vaccines in natural settings when administered to elderly patients, the pattern of infection with lethal doses, and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses must be determined.
Perhaps it's because SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and there have been no new cases reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS-CoV-borne disease continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements have been developed to combat MERS, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for individuals who are not immune is an urgent and critical task that requires solutions to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious challenges due to the long time (on average 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic mutation of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only just beginning to reveal the full clinical picture of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high complication rate and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this context, it is critical for health authorities to develop a disease predictive model to prioritize their response, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical trial data currently available, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years old, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive therapy were more likely to have underlying conditions and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require intensive therapy (average age 66 versus 51), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Morbidity and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute myocardial injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It's worth noting that age and underlying medical conditions are closely related and can distort the results.
Abnormalities identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor for the course of the disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
It was also suggested to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity, and COVID-19 prognosis.
In addition, the result can also be predicted by the increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase.
These enzymes are secreted in large amounts by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
So they're traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: For predicting outcomes and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, the data from chest radiography and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be considered along with other factors.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressors that are widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if steroids are required for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with high levels of uncertainty, and witness the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve stress in such patients and help them return to a normal life, psychological counseling and long-term support are essential.
According to demographic studies conducted to date, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic in its characteristics.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all in the early stages of infection.
This is why patients who are in the early stages of the disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period can, by living their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, whereas most cases did not occur at an early stage of infection.
So the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe than the SARS epidemic, and it's much harder to control.
China is currently working hard to declare a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, and to extend the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, which was introduced to interrupt the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures are causing huge damage to the economy and other areas of life in the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, suggesting that the spread of the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of decline will last 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the team led by Ira Longini have created a model to predict the end of the epidemic and have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in nasal and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, the decline in new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Initial estimates put the number of Ebola cases at up to a million, with half a million deaths.
But with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may lose its infectious capacity and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which means that oral-fecal transmission is also possible.
A recent study found that 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been due to hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare workers.
So, serious precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially health care workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders who come into contact with patients or those infected.
The first line of defense in reducing the risk of infection is wearing a face mask; both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent micro-droplets of potentially infected fluid from flying through the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series No 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of virions ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm, they only pass through 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks folded together, healthcare workers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear a protective gown that is fit for their body to further reduce the risk of exposure to the virus.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his system through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health-care workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type goggles.
All people in affected or potentially affected areas are strongly advised to wash their hands more often with disinfectant detergents, to stay indoors, to self-isolate, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to humanity, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020, that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the public that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity in human-to-human transmission and that preventing and controlling the spread of the disease would not be a problem.
The announcement significantly reduced social tensions, especially as the country prepared for the Chinese New Year, and missed a critical time when the disease could have been contained within Wuhan with minimal loss.
Chinese health authorities can learn from this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more careful public statements, as every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages, rather than to calm the public; and (4) conduct frequent, targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly check and improve the public response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unknown severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread across China and, at the time of writing, to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS has been reported to have recurred during an outbreak of COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of both containment and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and death rates among older people is also higher than among younger people.
The death rate from SARS is higher than that from COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients usually only infect others when the disease is severe, making COVID-19 more difficult to contain than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much more rapidly and extensively than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have a negative result from routine tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, patients who have been cured can test positive for the virus again.
All of this greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With COVID-19 research advancing so rapidly, some key questions remain unanswered, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the detection of a 96-percent homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot say that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated from bats.
What animal became the intermediate species that passed the virus from an original host, like bats, to humans?
Without the answers to the first two questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path and the epidemiological situation could escalate at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical tests have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter the airways and cause the subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-producing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve as it passes from human to human?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it recur like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life, whatever the cost.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, over millennia.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause a mild illness such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus in central China in late 2019 has once again drawn attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmissibility but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The identification of vector animals has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of animals that are carriers of coronaviruses may also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this review, we summarize the available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their discovery histories, as well as their zoonotic origins and modes of interspecies transmission.
It's important to note that we're comparing and matching different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
The conditions necessary for successful vector switching and the effect of virus evolution on the severity of the disease course are also noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of enveloped viruses with a single positive-polar RNA strand.
These viruses, with the largest RNA-containing virus genome, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which when viewed under the electron microscope resembles a crown.
Structurally, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reader frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins of the pp1a and pp1ab replicases.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, denoted nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike protein (S), membrane protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronaviruses also encode a number of non-specific lineage-specific accessor proteins.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronaviruses), with the beta-coronaviruses including most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, whereas birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have continually crossed species barriers, and some of them have evolved into human-danger pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus of the second type SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory illness (ARID) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first human coronavirus strain, HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a nasal swab sample from patients who had come down with colds in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause local infection symptoms.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in recent history; it affected over 8,000 people, and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a protracted epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019 and subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of 3 March 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people.
A wake-up call has been received and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are zoonotic in origin, with sources being bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to which viruses have adapted well and in which they do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge to China and the world.
Studying the zoonotic mechanism of human coronavirus origins will help to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution, and the factors that limit interspecies transmission.
It may also suggest or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important for preventing the re-emergence of the disease in the future.
This overview provides general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses are derived are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir hosts, but acquire pathogenic character after interspecies transfer to a new host.
We also analyze the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, where increasing transmissibility is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from nasopharyngeal samples from patients with the common cold, different coronaviruses had been found in different infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in the past decade.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966; this virus was subsequently adapted to multiply in the WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with high fever and cough being observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from an organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of suckers.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, which is not distinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are ubiquitous worldwide and are usually transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.
The incubation period for these two viruses is usually less than a week, followed by an illness of about two weeks.
In a study of volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the 'atypical pneumonia epidemic', was the first well-documented pandemic caused by a human coronavirus in human history, and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus identified.
The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Excluding the most active carriers, it was estimated that each case could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was at the 10th day of the illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle aches, headaches, fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough and respiratory failure.
Common laboratory abnormalities in SARS include lymphopenia, liver test abnormalities, and elevated creatinine kinase levels.
SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophage levels.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In severe cases, other organs than the lower respiratory tract can be infected, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, which are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be lethal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open biopsy of the lungs of a relative of a patient who had arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been directed at human coronavirus research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands.
It was first found to mainly affect young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
HCoV-NL63 causes symptoms such as runny nose, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the same virus being isolated from nasal swabs taken from an eight-month-old boy in the Netherlands who had pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it's actually widespread.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory illnesses, with peaks in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 has been associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been associated with exacerbations of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which causes mild respiratory illness, has been detected worldwide.
All four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation leading to highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have occurred and their causes are unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused a severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Typically, by acquiring the ability to be effectively transmitted and preserved in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Near East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but imported cases and sporadic secondary cases of close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are similar to those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  Both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other human-transmitted coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there were over 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), thus making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now, in retrospect, associated with infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been named coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in Hubei province in China is 4.2%, and outside of Hubei it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS, causes severe respiratory infections characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients also experience diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but has a higher transmissibility compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly worldwide.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have similar incubation periods and duration of disease course.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits the same tendency as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) in terms of severity of symptoms.
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly seen in infections with human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections, including nonspecific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, there are also interesting patterns in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that are characteristic of both human coronavirus causing out-of-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing out-of-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as that of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, a characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity, and sustained spread after transmission to humans.
All four human coronaviruses that cause non-hospital infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it's possible that these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be considered the sole survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe disease in humans, and people whose human coronaviruses cause severe disease, just didn't survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body to an extent that adaptive mutations accumulate to counteract the host's limiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its transmission to humans through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
There have been four out-of-hospital coronaviruses circulating in the population for many years that cause the common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need a reservoir animal.
Highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses have not adapted to humans well enough, and their human-to-human transmission cannot be supported.
They need to survive and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek out susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four non-hospital HCoVs.
It is very easily transmitted, as are hospital-acquired HCoVs, at least at present.
But it is more pathogenic than hospital-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying, and reservoir carriers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier for HCoVs if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the reservoir host is continuously carrying HCoVs for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoVs were only introduced into an intermediate host just before or around the time when they were introduced into humans, they were not well adapted to the new host and were often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as a reinforcing host, allowing the virus to replicate rapidly and then pass it on to humans, amplifying the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can survive a dead-end infection if they cannot withstand transmission within an intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to an intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS patient zero had a history of contact with game animals (wild).
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traders have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were the first confirmed carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, no SARS cases were reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in the Himalayan civets living in the wild or on farms and not reaching markets, SARS-CoV was not detected in most cases, which allows the conclusion that the Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifying carrier, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded that numerous species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate amplifying carriers.
They all appear to be dead-end carriers of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for a natural animal-borne SARS-CoV identified a close relative bat CoV, which was named the atypical HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) associated with HKU3 and which is present in Chinese HKU bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 8892% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been detected in bats, but none of them, except one, which is designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the receptor for SARS-CoV is human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from bat fecal samples, has been shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of recovering SARS patients could have neutralized WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV parental virus, and bats are not a direct SARS-CoV reservoir carrier.
Phylogenetic analysis has placed MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 of bats and CoV-HKU5 of bats.
Bat Co-VHKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor for the carrier, dipeptidyl dipeptide-4 (DPP4), to enter the viruses.
The sequences of the MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase are phylogenetically closer to those of bat beta-coronavirus found in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The homology of nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 of bats is only 87%.
So, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-tailed camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, has been isolated from nasal swabs from single-horned camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV showed mild symptoms but massive viral excretion.
Remarkably, infected camels not only excrete the virus through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus excretion in bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before symptoms occurred and are likely to be due to human-to-human transmission or transmission through unknown channels including unidentified animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides is 96.2% identical to that of the bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from the Asian horseshoe shrew Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may or may not be the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
The immediate animal carriers of SARS-CoV-2 are likely to be among wild species sold and slaughtered at the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which has been linked to many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission case.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also carry the parent beta-CoV, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes is 8592% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% nucleotide sequence identity.
They cluster in two sub-lineages of differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RBD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with amino acid sequence identity at the 97.4% level.
On the contrary, the RSDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contingencies in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other assembly and manual processing techniques to obtain a genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
The possibility that pangolin has become one of the intermediate animals-carriers of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2's relatives, there is currently no evidence to support a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has not yet been established.
Whereas the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 relatives, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between pangolin beta-coronaviruses, related SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is due to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is for recombination between pangolin beta-coronavirus, a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in a third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A definitive decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still pending.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parental strains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
Bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American three-colored ground sloth, has been reported to show close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that camels could be its intermediate carrier.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission events in the anamnesis.
When HCoV-OC43 was transmitted between species around 1890 and humans became infected from domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not so clear.
Bat alphacoronaviruses, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been detected.
Between them is the alpha-coronavirus alpaca.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who were able to interact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
At the same time, humans are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs, related to HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoVs have caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca coronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas may have received an alpha-CoV, a related HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses may have served as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and one-horned camels may have been intermediate carriers that transmitted the virus to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial identification and has subsequently been confirmed by subsequent studies.
It's clear that bats provide a rich pool of different viruses for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Their longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make bats "ideal propagators".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was introduced to one-horned camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, MERS-CoV is very mild in its disease and has a relatively low mutation rate.
Its episodic transmission to humans is incidental, and humans remain a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the dead end carriers of beta-coronaviruses, related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or rule out several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be reservoir carriers for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or by cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate reinforcing hosts that a related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently encountered.
People are infected by the virus through the cutting of carcasses and the consumption of wild meat.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Third, as noted above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third form that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for an animal origin for SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of host animals, three main factors from viruses also contributed to the crossing of species barriers.
First of all, they have a relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of coronaviruses can be considered Moderate-high with an average replacement rate of approximately 104 replacements per year in a single site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a corrective exoribonuclease, which, if removed, leads to an extremely high rate of mutation and weakness or even death.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than that of their hosts.
Furthermore, the mutation rate can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It's believed that this virus has already adapted to another host close to humans.
Aside from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-capped camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 will rapidly lose efficacy as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution favorable to the emergence of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are present.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, because of their unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the host, which serves as a mixing vessel, there is often a switch of threads.
Highly homologous full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interaction of the carrier with regard to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
This article uses SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV is rapidly adapting to different carriers, especially mutations in the S protein RSD.
In general, the RSD of the S protein of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor, and the host antibody response intensively selects it.
The RSDs in SARS-CoV are amino acids, 318 to 510-u, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coreceptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
SARS-CoV RSD is able to recognize APF2 receptors from different animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, making interspecies transmission of the virus possible.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in the RSD that are different from human and civet viral strains, with 4 of them being in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV cyvette has K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spike-like protein interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for the virus to adapt to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of protein S leads to the fact that the binding affinity of protein S to human APF2 could have changed.
Indeed, a study using cryo-electron microscopy suggests that the affinity of this link is 10×20 times higher than that between human APF2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors are required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the N amino peptide for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsilic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecific transmission of HCoVs is also driven by other factors of dependence and limitation of the carrier.
Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, unicorns and rodents, may represent a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoVs must usurp dependence factors and subjugate host restriction factors.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the host still need to be defined and categorized.
Impartial whole genome screening of dependence factors and restriction of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology could yield good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunity for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoVs.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving forces of HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with alpha and gamma coronaviruses, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Localizations of the recombination have also been identified in the non-structural proteins nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that epidemic MERS-CoV underwent recombinant events between different lineages, which occurred in one-horned camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs have recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of the virus being removed from selection pressures, such as from the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to binucleotide deletion.
While an intact open ORF4 reading frame can be observed in bats and camel viruses, related to HCoV-229E, alpaca coronavirus exhibits a single nucleotide insert, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
Infection of bats with coronaviruses has been associated with mild symptoms or no symptoms, suggesting a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the aprigulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and low expression of molecules of the main complex of histosocompatibility class I.
Furthermore, the high levels of active oxygen forms, which are provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while simultaneously affecting the exoribonuclease reads, thus creating selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus, which when penetrated by a new carrier are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that in the last 20 years, there have been three new human coronaviruses.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without causing a strong immune response in the host.
That's the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mostly associated with an overactivated immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of unbinding the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early phase of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, the bat has a disrupted NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
Based on this, inhibiting the NLRP3-inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-coronavirus has been found that has 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that has 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found that are strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of the pangolin beta-CoV gene may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronavirus has attracted worldwide attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Strong evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection originates from human-to-human contact with civets in markets, closing wildlife markets and destroying civets in them could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of diverse lines of beta-corona pandas, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pandas should be removed from food markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via pangolins and other mammals and how this might occur remains a matter for future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed for a long time in one-horned camels.
These camels are an important means of transportation, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the Chinese wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a complex approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks.
There are a variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulating around the world.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There is a huge potential for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, leading to novel coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
To reduce the amount of unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
After the hardships of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we need better preparedness and a plan to respond to these situations.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the opportunity arises to take over new territories.
Although many of the bats' properties are beneficial for the spread of viruses, educating people to stay away from bats can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, we need to conduct continuous surveillance of mammals, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
There are still some fragments missing from the puzzle of zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to pangolins, it's interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, then it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is the true intermediate host, then we need to figure out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin, or another mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural hosts.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a brief reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and validated recommendations for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research findings and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the document "Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19" (version 7) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was named severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication has attracted a great deal of attention.
It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research findings and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, the National Health Commission of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published seven editions of the "Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19", with some of its provisions substantially changed.
A recent paper by Zhou and co-authors commented on our recommendations, providing simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added to our recommendations new practical evidence and has also provided valuable reference information on this pandemic that has swept the world.
We acknowledge the high value of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (trial version 7) and the results of current studies, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (dated 3 March 2020), for a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case of the disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or stay in Wuhan and its surroundings or in other settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings or from other settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed illnesses (≥2 cases of high fever or respiratory symptoms reported within 2 weeks in small areas such as a classroom, apartment, office, school, home, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) having outward signs of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count is normal or low with decreased lymphocyte count at early symptom manifestation.
Diagnosis for a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) genome-wide sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies IgM and IgG; or a change in test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody IgG, or a titration of at least 4 times per recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It should also be noted that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document added a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples.
Pathogenetic blood test diagnostics were added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then in the seventh edition the need for serological proof was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to find the optimal set of nucleic acid detection for rapid diagnosis and to analyse samples from the respiratory tract, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
However, there is increasing evidence that caution should be exercised in treating patients with atypical symptoms and those without severe symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a low risk group.
The scoring system also requires refinement in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to provide more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
In terms of the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that readers follow and strictly follow the latest recommendations given in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19  daily maximum
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a single day.
That's the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were registered, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
There were 17 deaths in all.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzabi, two of the deceased were over 60 years of age, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
A clinic employee told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was undergoing treatment at the Kuwait-based Meitri clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned, until next Saturday.
Public transportation was suspended on March 26 and was supposed to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Carriage of essential goods  medicines, fuel and food  was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth infection mark worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people have died from the COVID-19 coronavirus.
The breakthrough came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first case and Zambia recorded its first death from the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that had not reported any cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 CET (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection, of which at least 5,900 have resulted in death.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the self-isolation regime of the city's citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite the self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew lasted only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand was planning to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state's home isolation order has been extended through May 1.
Stores in Australia are limiting the amount of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time in all stores across the country to two and one pack respectively.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
The restrictions were announced in box office ads and on the network's Facebook page.
Citizens have reportedly begun to stock up for emergencies due to fears that COVID-19 could lead to the imposition of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one pack.
Previously, on March 4 and 5 respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packs.
Retail chain Coles in its March 8 press release reported that with the introduction of the four-pack limit, "toilet paper is still being sold too fast in many stores - one delivery within an hour" - and called such demand "unprecedented", while ALDI's Facebook post on Tuesday called the trend "unexpected".
According to a Woolworths representative, there's been a sharp increase in sales over the past week.
Costco in Canberra last week also limited the number to two packs.
To make up for the shortfall, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increasing the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to stock up, but are struggling due to local government restrictions on truck schedules.
He expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but fewer and fewer good offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the exhaustion of stocks, some stores can not hold promotions on Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are stocking up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the stock is small, and after selling the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of shortage of stocks.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and products like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizer could be placed on those shelves in large quantities, shoppers probably wouldn't panic so much", says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of Who Gives a Crap recycled toilet paper announced that they were out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which also makes Sorbent products, said they were working around the clock to ensure sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne dropped due to the lack of buyers during the Labor Day holiday week, some real estate sellers started offering free toilet paper to the first auctioners.
A four-page issue of the NT News daily, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, stores were reluctant to put restrictions on the number of items they bought at first, saying they had no plans to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, groceries, hand washes, and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was noticed on Sunday evening that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic .
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "pandemic" refers to the scale of the disease, not the danger of specific cases, the WHO notes that governments need to take measures:
All countries together are still in a position to influence the course of the pandemic.
This is possible if countries identify, test, treat, isolate, monitor and mobilise their citizens", explained WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming rate of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming rate of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has yet been traced from its inception to its continuing global spread".
Mr. Gebreisu expressed a similar view, saying that we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
We've also never seen a pandemic that we can control before.
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then upgraded it to a pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "It's just beginning, and it's going to get worse".
According to the Associated Press, as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020, a public health emergency of international concern was declared, which was subsequently recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first appearance of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
At present, there is no vaccine or specific treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and recommended prevention measures include hand washing, covering the mouth for cough, maintaining social distancing, and identifying and self-isolating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic consequences, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods, exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's students.
Online disinformation about the virus has been spreading, with cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese nationals, other East and Southeast Asian nationals, or people who resemble them, and other groups of people living in areas where significant outbreaks have been reported.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trains and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market of Hue, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently discovered virus that has many similarities to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019, and the infected person had not visited the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the cases recorded in December 2019 were linked to this market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified South China Morning Post report suggested that the first case was a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province on 17 November 2019.[1] On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases in China had decreased, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
The number of cases may be significantly underestimated, in part because of the large number of cases with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of infection among young people had been reported, with patients 19 years and younger accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide.The United Kingdom's Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population would be infected by the time effective group immunity was established in the country's population.
The statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been found positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted official policies that mandate no testing for only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected, and that such unrecorded patients were the source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure could be as high as 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients recover from the disease well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being  14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% of deaths were associated with concomitant diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official data on COVID-19 pandemic deaths typically include deaths of patients who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include deaths of people who have not been tested  for example, deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy suggests that the actual death toll during the pandemic was 4.5 times the official COVID figure.
A spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges: "We know that [the declared death toll] is lower than the actual number". His words are supported by reports of some isolated cases in the US.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines, and outside Asia  in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All of the indicators vary by region and time of incidence; they are also influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of health care systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status. The mortality/disease rate is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases during a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
The data varies by region.
In China, the mortality-to-infectiousness ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms on January 1-10-2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of deaths due to disease (CFR)  the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of certain population groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these numbers for specific groups of people.
The death rate from this pandemic as a whole is estimated by the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine to be between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
The WHO says the current pandemic is manageable.
The peak and exact duration of the outbreak are not quantifiable and may vary by location.
Maceo Bozziani, a researcher at Penn State University, says that "uncontrolled outbreaks tend to plateau and then, when the number of available carriers runs out, they begin to subside".
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, says that "it could all be over by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 will circulate, possibly for a year or two.
According to a study conducted by Imperial College, under the direction of Neil Ferguson, "Physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is developed (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University researcher, believes: "I don't think this coronavirus will ever go away completely, because it's so easily transmitted, and it could turn into a seasonal disease, with outbreaks every year".
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on the collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, mucus in the airways (slime), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, itching, vomiting, blood-thirst, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims that approximately one in six people develops a severe form of the disease with respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such immediate symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or feeling of tightness in the chest, sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up, and reddening of the face or lips.
Some people who are infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical signs, but test results confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that people who are in close contact with confirmed cases be monitored closely and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of asymptomatic cases ranges from a few to as many as 44 percent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. The symptom of loss of smell is not yet fully understood: initial estimates of the percentage of COVID-19 patients who develop this symptom initially were 30%, then fell to 15%.
Some details about the way the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is thought to be transmitted primarily through close contact, as well as through small droplets that are released into the air with coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is defined as contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies have shown that when a person coughs, the drops can travel from 15 feet (4.5 m) to 27 feet (8.2 m).
There is speculation that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets emitted into the air during a conversation, which can remain in the air for a longer period of time.Respiratory droplets may also be formed by exhaling, including during a conversation, although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air.
The droplets can go into the mouth or nose of people nearby, and into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, can cause the exhalation products to be sprayed and, therefore, the virus to be spread through the air.
It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most transmissible during the first three days after symptom onset, although it can be spread both before symptom onset and in later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the test came back positive three days before symptoms appeared, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted before symptoms become severe.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also found cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one person can infect 2-3 others, and the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus is able to live up to three days, on cardboard surfaces  for one day, and on copper surfaces  for up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a novel virus first identified in three people with pneumonia from the group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by using household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great deal of similarity to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole-genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in the amino acid sequences of certain parts of the genome of pangolin viruses and humans.
Whole-genome comparisons to date have shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not sufficient to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be diagnosed preliminarily on the basis of symptoms, although this must ultimately be confirmed by analysis of the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (PCR) of the infected secretion or by computed tomography.
A study comparing PCR and CT scans in Wuhan found that CT scans are significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of their imaging functions are similar to those of other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Testing for polymerase chain reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is performed.
It can be done on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually done with nasopharm, although it can also be done with a java swab. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been found to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral clouding of the type of the matte glass and the absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of confirmed cases.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19, the images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A large study in China compared chest CT scans with PCR tests and found that although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be decoded more quickly; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
Concentrating neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the virus using x-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using tissues when coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a face mask in public.
Physical distancing is also recommended to prevent transmission of the disease.Many governments recommend that people refrain from any non-essential travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in a population some members of which do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare workers caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions for contact with other people and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use of government data on people's mobile phone locations for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on developing solutions to ensure the privacy of personal data  for example, logging the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, they will receive a notification, and there are unsubstantiated versions of how to prevent infection - for example, by rubbing one's nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on developing one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if your hands are heavily contaminated, and before eating, after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, when outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks open its protective shell.
Additionally, if soap and water are unavailable, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel the disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) containing 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.27,5% povidone-iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in the case of suspected or confirmed COVID in an institution such as an office or day care facility, all spaces in such an establishment, including offices, restrooms, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by people who are ill, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that when you cough or sneeze, you cover your mouth and nose with a back elbow or a towel, and discard used personal hygiene items immediately.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and range of the dissemination of the products of the exhalation that are dispersed into the air by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of a face mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their faces, and touching the face with dirty hands is the main way of infection".
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear face masks if they are at high risk, such as those who care for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing a mask does reduce the amount of contact with the face.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing cloth face masks for non-medical purposes.China separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, wearing a mask is recommended in public transportation or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are urging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are not allowed to go out without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government has also asked citizens to wear masks in public.
On April 1, Taiwan, which has been producing ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, mandated the use of medical masks by all passengers on trains and intercity buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a face mask when going outside; those who cannot afford to buy masks have been advised to make them at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Prevention measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions particularly affected by the outbreak are now mandating or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people allowed to gather in one place as recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (in regions where there was no data on COVID-19), to 50 and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of severe disease. The CDC recommends that they stay home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term social distancing with physical distancing, thus clarifying the purpose of this measure  to reduce physical contact within social networks, whether through virtual communication or physical distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been interpreted to imply that people should subject themselves to complete social isolation rather than remain in contact with other people through alternative means.Some agencies have published sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it was recommended that you only have sex with your regular partner, with whom you live and who you are sure is free of the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they may be infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation, and many governments have either mandated or recommended that all residents in affected areas self-quarantine.
High-risk individuals have been ordered to strict quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected individuals, or who have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, were advised to quarantine for 14 days from the date of their last possible contact.
Outbreak control strategies include containment, containment or mitigation.
Containment is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate those infected, as well as other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer contained, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Prevention and control measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage an outbreak of an infectious disease is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the leveling of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to deal with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in promoting and participating in such measures; and environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and has set up a system to alert people of the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected individuals who were in self-isolation and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased production of medical masks and has imposed fines for stockpiling excess medicines. Modelling in the UK and the US has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak health burden by two-thirds and death rates by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and health system collapse.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if earlier), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have social and economic costs.
There are currently no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can only cause harm.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the primary response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to facilitate the redistribution of resources on several levels, including focusing laboratory services on testing for COVID-19, eliminating non-emergency procedures when possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and expanding intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available IVLs and beds.
There are various theories as to where the very first case of infection - the so-called "patient zero" - might have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus infection likely occurred on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei Province has been steadily increasing over the past month.
They were mostly associated with the wholesale Huanan seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.On December 26, a case of mass illness with pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in a clinic in Hubei Province, treated by a doctor, Zhang Tianjin, who reported the case to the Zhejiang Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan City Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a coronavirus similar to SARS.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police about being held responsible for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for causing panic.
Later, on 31 December, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
Wuhan's health authorities reported a number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January, with the number of cases doubling roughly every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation and major railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had developed symptoms of the disease.As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and over 364,000 recoveries.
About 200 countries and territories have reported at least one reported case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and have established border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay-at-home, mandatory shelter-at-home or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the United States population, were under some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later, that figure had risen to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the date has not been verified, this is 17 November.
On December 26, Zhang Jixiang, a doctor, was working on a case of a mass pneumonia of unknown type, which was reported by her clinic to Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of samples from patients, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
In response to such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about the responsibility for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the newly discovered virus' ability to transmit from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later dubbed a "people's war" by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China.
The "largest-scale quarantine in human history" began to unfold, with a sanitary cordon and a ban on travel to and from Wuhan announced on January 23, later spreading to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The city has banned the use of personal transport.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary Huoshenshang hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built to accommodate other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also re-purposed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
Hong Kong and Macau have introduced a number of measures, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, authorities have imposed a remote work mode.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside Hubei province.
Public transportation schedules were changed, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Many cities have introduced citizen controls, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of outdoor restrictions. After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the importation of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city, and as of 23 March, there has been only one case of domestic transmission in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases of the disease transmitted within the country had been largely stopped and the outbreak in China was brought under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei, except Wuhan, were lifted, two months after the province was closed to quarantine.On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March.
Those wishing to visit China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government called on enterprises and factories to resume work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, a national three-minute "silence" was held at 10:00 am, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coinciding with the holiday of Qinmin, however, the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the dead online, observing physical distancing to avoid a repeated outbreak of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Health Ministry reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji in Daegu.
Shinchondji's followers came to Taegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 (about 13%) of the church's 9,336 followers reported having symptoms of the disease.
Korea reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases on February 28, and that number had risen to 3,150 by February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been placed under quarantine after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The outbreak affected travel, hence airline schedules were changed.South Korea has deployed a program to screen the population for the presence of the virus, contact tracing, and quarantine contact persons.This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of symptoms via a mobile app for all foreign arrivals, a head-on test for the virus, with results ready the next day, and an expanded testing capability that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in combating the outbreak, despite not isolating entire cities there.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for what they considered to be the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had recorded its lowest total number of cases in a single day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be placed under a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, 121 countries had contacted South Korea for help in testing for the virus on April 1.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be placed in quarantine.
In March, plans were announced to limit inter-city travel, but intensive inter-city travel continued before the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, with Iran becoming the centre of the virus's spread after China in February.
Amid claims of a cover-up over the extent of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February, more than a dozen countries had linked their cases of the disease to Iran, indicating that the extent of the outbreak there may be more severe than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that date.
Iran's parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, tested positive for the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all prisoners who fall into this category.
The organization says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
By March 23, Iran was reporting 50 new coronavirus cases every hour and one new coronavirus death every ten minutes.
A WHO representative said that the case rate in Iran could be up to five times higher than the official figures.
It is also suggested that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased on countries that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the disease was confirmed to have entered Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law on containment of the outbreak, under which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed under quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entrance and exit to the outbreak area will be blocked.
The Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country on March 4, as 100 deaths had already been recorded in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for the establishment of the queue of medical care for patients who may have to be involved.
On March 19, Italy overtook China in coronavirus deaths to become the world's number one, after 3,405 deaths were announced.
On March 22, it became known that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, Italy had 128 948 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 15 887 deaths and 21 815 recoveries, with most of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report notes that the high death rate in Italy may be due to a combination of two factors: the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the lack of capacity to screen everyone who has coronavirus to date.
The United Kingdom has responded to this virus more calmly than any other affected country, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not require citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticised for not responding quickly and seriously enough to the danger facing the country's population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contact be avoided, suggesting that people work from home whenever possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment venues such as pubs and sports clubs should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay working citizens up to 80% of their wages, but no more than £2,500 a month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the imposition of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for those that provide "living activities" for the population, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington was a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15.
On January 29, the White House created the Coronavirus Task Force.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government's lead organization for public health, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, testing the population in the United States did not begin immediately, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the failure of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval until late February for the use of non-government test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done by appointment).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States as of February 27.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been administered by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, waited for their test for hours or days". After the first case of coronavirus death in the United States was reported from Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which was soon followed by other states.
On March 3, Seattle schools were cancelled, and by mid-March schools were closed nationwide. On March 6, 2020, a group of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, briefed the United States on the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.

On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency, which allowed federal funds to be used to combat the crisis.
Starting on March 15, many businesses across the US began closing or cutting hours to help combat the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the outbreak was confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.On March 23, it was reported that New York City had recorded 10,700 cases in a single day, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing was likely to be an effective measure as the estimates of doubling cases dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, New York City had reported 32,308 cases and 672 deaths. It was reported that the US had recorded more confirmed cases of coronavirus on 26 March than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, the United States of America had confirmed 400,335 cases and 12,841 deaths.
According to media reports on March 30, President Trump has decided to extend the social distancing period until April 30.
That same day, the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort docked in New York Harbor.
On 3 April, 884 deaths from coronavirus were reported in the US in 24 hours.
New York State had more than 100,000 cases as of April 3, and the White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring open data by using Vice President Mike Pence's office to monitor public statements and publications by health officials and academics related to the virus.
President Trump's supporters are divided on how well he has handled the crisis.
Some officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. dependence on importing critical materials, including basic necessities, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns that was used to map and predict patterns of disease spread.
Based on the 2018 International Air Transport Association data, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei hosted the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali was named the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared.On 7 February, Australia adopted its Emergency Response Plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this context, it is said that there is much to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communication in the event of a threat.
On 21 March, Australia declared a human biosafety emergency.
Due to the effective quarantine measures applied in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights to their home countries, for which the Chinese authorities gave their permission.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan evacuations of their citizens.
Pakistan has said it has no plans to evacuate its citizens from China.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner.
On February 21, a plane with 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government departed with 112 South African citizens on board.
The passengers were given a medical examination before departure, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
Tests were taken from all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and as a precaution they were all kept under observation and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students studying at American universities have banded together to collect and send aid to regions of China affected by the virus, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to Hubei Province clinics on 30 January.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a donation of US$100 million to WHO to fund the development of a vaccine and treatment for coronavirus, and to protect the "at-risk populations" of Africa and South Asia from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.

After the situation in China stabilized, the country also sent aid to other countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute to its member states.
He later also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVs to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada, and the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus testing kits that are only 30 percent accurate, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were thought to have been made in China, but it was later discovered that they had been shipped from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank began implementing emergency aid operations for developing countries.
WHO has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted the stark differences between the 2002-2004 outbreak of SARS, which accused the Chinese authorities of withholding information, allegedly hindering the prevention and control of the disease, and the current crisis, where the central government regularly provided updated information on the situation to avoid panic ahead of the Chinese New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Gauden Galea noted that while the measure was not specifically recommended by WHO, it was also "a very important confirmation of the implementation of the epidemic containment commitment in the place of greatest spread", and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the infection was confirmed to be capable of human-to-human transmission outside China and the number of infected in other countries was increasing, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth such emergency since 2009, when the measure was first used during the influenza pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the announcement of PHEIC was due to the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said that there was "no reason for measures that unnecessarily impede international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for US$675 million to provide strategic preparedness for low-income countries, citing the urgent need to provide assistance to those countries that do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries.
Mr Tedros also said that "the measure of our preparedness is the degree of our weakest link's preparedness to an epidemic", and called on the international community to "make a choice: invest today or pay tomorrow". At a press conference on 11 February, WHO officially named the disease "COVID-19".
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem".
The result was the creation of the UN Crisis Management Team, which coordinates all UN responses; these steps, WHO says, will allow "to focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to address the outbreak in a broader social and economic context".
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint task force, which provided international experts and WHO staff on the ground in China to assist in the country's domestic situation and assess the "seriousness of the disease and its contagion", organized workshops and meetings with leading national institutions, and field trips to assess the effectiveness of provincial and district level response measures, including urban and rural areas. On 25 February, WHO stated that the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that "it is too early to call this disease a pandemic, but countries should not be ready for it".
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global spread of the coronavirus would be raised from high to very high highest alert and risk.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet for readiness to the real world: it's time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country and you need to be prepared and also stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the worst-case scenario.
Ryan also stated that the current data does not serve as a basis for a global pandemic to be declared by public health officials, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean that "we are essentially recognizing the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of being infected with this virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that WHO is "deeply concerned both by the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in relation to the problem". WHO has been heavily criticized for what it considers to be inadequate approaches to the concept of pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the situation, a petition was submitted to the WHO Director-General, Mr Tedros Adhanom, asking him to resign, and 733,000 people had signed the petition as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of upholding the rights of every human being during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The panel stated that everyone has the right to have life-saving measures applied to them, and that the government is responsible for organizing such measures.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way be used as an excuse to discriminate against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, minority groups, senior citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, people living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of state support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to share views and provide recommendations.
The digital hub contains information on the policies of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, to eliminate the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions, to help countries learn from each other and to promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for its actions in dealing with the pandemic, which started in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals reflected dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have disagreed with the earlier claim that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but have taken the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", stating that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic", and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that such an approach is racist and "distracts from the US administration's inability to contain the spread of the disease".
The Daily Beast has obtained a US government cable containing a communications strategy apparently devised by the National Security Council, with the strategy being described as follows: "It's all about China.
We are asked to spread this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda effort to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a "geopolitical component" involving a "war of influence" and a "politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China is pushing hard for its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US".
China has also urged the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports suggesting it has sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The US government has also been accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to its own country.
Disputes over medical masks have also arisen between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
Turkey also seized hundreds of I.V. machines intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for Italy's coronavirus-ridden economy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that only China had responded in a bilateral fashion.
This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity.
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the dispatch of Russian military medics, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the world public at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the US.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production rates, they will also be able to provide retaliatory assistance in case of need".
NATO military exercises  Defender 2020 scheduled in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States  NATO's largest-scale military exercise since the end of the Cold War  will be held in a reduced format.
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary General Kate Hudson criticized Defender 2020 (Defender 2020) exercises: "In the current public health crisis, the exercise is putting at risk not only the lives of the U.S. military and many European countries participating, but also the lives of the people in the countries where the exercise is to be held". The Iranian government has been badly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament and 15 other current or former politicians infected.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter appealed to world leaders for help, saying that his country was facing difficulties in fighting the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to the US sanctions imposed against Iran. The epidemic has led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and child care system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political analysts expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan's "vague and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-designated site.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for the impeachment of Mr. Mon for what they saw as the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
Some commentators are concerned that the move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orban an indefinite mandate to rule by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections, and punish those accused of spreading fake news about the virus and the government's response to the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the panic buying of goods and disruptions to production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment, caused by increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Panic shopping also occurred in several communities, leading to the disappearance of essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry, in particular, has been warning of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to the director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This jump has led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to normal prices, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO has warned that healthcare workers will be under attack because of it.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, DaiGoo customers have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas managed to avoid acute food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products, which proved successful, helped to avoid the acute food shortage that was expected in Europe, as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with its small-scale agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but industry representatives believe that prices for agricultural products may rise.
Food stores were empty only temporarily, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials ensured access to pork stocks to ensure the population had enough to eat.
Similar laws requiring food manufacturers to maintain emergency food stocks exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in a 20.5% drop in retail sales.
Mainland China  is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, the viral outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarai, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that volatility in markets will persist until a clearer picture of the potential outcomes is emerging.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could surpass the impact of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
One estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last for up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have taken "urgent action" after oil prices plummeted due to a drop in demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed the steepest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points - the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
By the end of the week, all three indices had shown more than a 10-percent drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but kept the outlook negative.
Shares fell again due to fears over the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and governments.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism  is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closures of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, the main tourist season of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of large-scale events, including annual New Year festivals; private companies have also shuttered their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year's events were cancelled, and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass crowds; for example, the Forbidden City in Beijing was closed and traditional temple fairs were cancelled.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the infectious disease response to its highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected on a global scale, with store hours reduced and some stores temporarily closed.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have seen sales volumes drop by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, shopping mall attendance fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world have introduced additional measures such as improved sanitation, installation of temperature checking equipment for visitors, and cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 1422 million more people out of poverty than it would have been in a similar situation but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China's 300 million migrant farm workers have found themselves at home in their home provinces or locked up in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak in the United States could result in the loss of 47 million jobs, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who receive a daily wage without work. A survey by the Angus Rayad Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have faced unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since the introduction of self-isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have moved their employees to a government-subsidized reduced work schedule  part-time.
The German part-time scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected organizations as well as individuals, whether they are officially employed or self-employed, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to support their (often state-funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for the public by ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, as well as, where possible, supporting people of the arts.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls, and other cultural institutions around the world have been closed indefinitely, or access to them has been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events, and performances have been cancelled or rescheduled.
In return, there have been active efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and gaining momentum consequence of the virus's spread is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week in Rome, which is held in the last week of the Christian penitential period  of Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend Sunday services; some churches have begun broadcasting church services on radio, live, or on television, while some church leaders are suggesting outdoor services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels, and St. Peter's Square to Christian pilgrims, and later other religious organizations also canceled services and limited access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned access to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina for foreign pilgrims and its own residents.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 UEFA Europa League, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "postponed beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021". Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players switching to online gaming, and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also been affected as various music groups have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have also canceled all of their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun exploring ways to continue their work and share their work online, by hosting live online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in the creative professions to continue performing, producing or publishing their work.
Many internet memes have been created about the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and tend to ease anxiety during periods of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as people from hotspots in Europe, the US, and elsewhere.
Cases of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
News reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or got a fair deal for anything.
Some African countries are also seeing a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese citizens and residents living in affected areas both offline and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread to new countries, notably Italy  the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the impact of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition at an early stage, urging the banning of Chinese citizens from their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was the most followed hashtag on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report increasing levels of racist sentiment and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics have deemed the comment racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanjar.
Students coming from China's north-eastern border region and studying in India's major cities have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of Bharatiya Janata Party State unit, West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "so God took revenge on them".
These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called them "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have resurfaced due to the pandemic: foreigners were called "foreign trash" and "objects to be disposed of".
Many pay-to-read newspapers have removed such restrictions for some or all of the districts affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak available to the public.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and intended only for detecting RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
It's used to confirm recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to require hospitalization or nonexistent.
The exact mortality rate of this disease and the level of herd immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among the population due to limited testing capabilities.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and information on how many tests were done in different countries is highly contradictory.
Such variations in data are likely to have a significant impact on reported mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
With the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from the respiratory tract obtained by various methods, including a nasal swab or a sputum sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The CT-PCR test, carried out on swabs taken from the throat, is only valid during the first week of illness.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it can still multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of illness, a suction catheter may be used to remove material from the lower respiratory tract, or a fecal product (faeces) may be used as an alternative.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Scharethe Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 kits subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its own test. On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a kit to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical-level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the E gene, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive permission from the National Drug Administration of China for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits gave incomplete results due to faulty reagents and the narrow testing area the CDC operated in Atlanta; resulting in an average of fewer than 100 samples being successfully processed per day for the whole of February 2020.
Two-component tests were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only after that date that state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 is available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been stated; collection and processing of samples must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Scientific Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic developed a test for detecting COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be performed in 3.5 hours on a large sample size, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency authorization (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to conduct testing of the Abbott m2000 system; previously the FDA had granted similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in as little as five minutes, and negative results in  13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S., and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.[citation needed] A test is currently being developed in Taiwan using a monoclonal antibody that binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the novel coronavirus in a specific way, and there is hope of being able to obtain results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
A review of the March 2020 literature concluded that chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT scans may have value even before symptoms appear.
Typical signs detected during CT include bilateral multi-lateral subpleural focuses of compaction of the type of "matte glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterious distribution.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of limbic and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR and CT imaging techniques used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic found that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions are consistent with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in diagnosing COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR as the primary screening method.
The partial immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after day 7 of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control. The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT).
In many clinical laboratories, these tests can be performed by high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
A single peripheral blood sample is usually used in CLT, although serial samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
In PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection stage for taking a sample analysis is not required.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now extend their antibody testing.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one test for emergency use. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The test yield is several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore this method works much faster than a conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected within 14 days of infection, and in early April, the UK found that none of its antibody testing kits had produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: "Emergency department staff give a sample tube to the patient, the patient spits in it, gives it back, and after some time gets the test results".The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it has been used to transport a patient.
Express testing centers have helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and largest testing procedures of any other country. On March 2, in Germany, the National Association of Medicare Physicians said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, compared to only 10,700 tests per week a week a week earlier.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's overall testing performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to hold an express test in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 tests had been taken for SARS-CoV-2, up to and including week 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) had a positive result. Researchers from the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneously testing samples taken from 64 patients, combining the samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample shows a positive result. In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a 2,000 square meter temporary emergency detection laboratory called Yao-Hyun (Chinese or On o), which can process more than 10 000 samples per day.
The lab was built by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just five days; modeling showed that if the lab had not been commissioned at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and the quarantine costs would have been doubled.
The opening of the Wuhan laboratory was followed by the Huo-Yin laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai  in total 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, daily total throughput was at 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays open multiplex circuits were released that can test up to 1,122 COVID19 patient assays using only 93 probes. Such balanced designs can work in small labs, eliminating the need for robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, due to a shortage and insufficient number of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols that involve heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes with the goal of releasing RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the per capita testing of coronavirus in the United Arab Emirates currently exceeds that of any other country, and soon a large portion of the population will be tested.
This was due to the rapid testing capabilities, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and BGI mass testing laboratories (built on the basis of their Huoh-Yang emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, which was deployed in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and is the first laboratory in the world of this scale operating outside of China.
Different variants of the test, targeting different parts of the coronavirus' genetic profile, have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kits, which are sent to low-income countries that don't have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was unavailable until 28 January, resulting in a lack of test kits in the U.S. At the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide the sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say that the widespread availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many private US laboratories that received hundreds of thousands of test samples were overloaded, and their stocks of test material and chemical reagents were rapidly depleting.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "deficiencies", and for this reason the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private developers from developing the tests. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccurate results could be a poor sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would recall the test kits that gave inaccurate results and replace them with other sets  sets from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a "high error rate" and the Ministry "never used them". The UK had purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were unsuitable for use.
The quarantine measures for persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as the surveillance of people with whom such patients have been in contact, have been positive.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where the first death from COVID-19 in Italy occurred, conducted two cycles of testing of a population of about 3,400 people, approximately ten days apart.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entrance to the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less intense than in other developed countries, and there were no extreme restrictions such as forced restaurant and store closures.
Many events were canceled, and on 28 March Singapore began urging residents to stay home, but schools, which had been closed on 23 March, reopened on schedule.
A few other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic through intensive contact tracing, entry restrictions, testing, and quarantine measures, but with less aggressive restrictions.
The statistical study found that countries that had more tests compared to deaths had much lower death rates, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries lacking the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of these 16 control laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following graph, the % positive column is dependent on the testing policy adopted in the country.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients will have a higher positive test percentage than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of whether they have symptoms, all other things being equal.
Hand washing, also known as "hand hygiene", is the process of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand-washing with soap at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
People can also catch respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or the common cold, by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
The five critical times during the day to wash your hands with soap are before and after defecating, after washing your baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding your baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, and poultry.
If soap and water are not available, ash can be used to clean hands.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the patient's care.
After changing diapers or washing a child who has gone to the toilet.
After a snort, cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicines or undergoing medical procedures can help prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to rid the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This is especially important for people who are involved in cooking or in the medical field, but it's also important for everyone else.
Hand washing is very good for your health, for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, it prevents infectious diarrhea, it reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the rate of infant mortality in home birth.
A 2013 study found that better handwashing could slightly increase growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of hand washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income communities.
Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory illness (ARI), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of OCD, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, claiming the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Nearly 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet, which has become a firm habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the death rate from diarrhea by almost half and the death rate from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents the spread of impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to dry skin and, consequently, to damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that too much handwashing can lead to itchy and flaky skin and a disease known as eczema or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called 'critical moments' during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after defecation (urinating, defecating), after washing the baby's buttocks (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Some other times to wash your hands to prevent transmission are before or after handling a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing, or sniffing, after touching animal waste or animal waste, and after touching litter.
Handwashing with soap is not common in many countries.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was in Saudi Arabia; the US was closer to the middle, at 77%, and the lowest was in China at 23%. There are now several behavioral change methodologies and ways to train children to wash their hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group handwashing at a set time of day is one methodology that helps teach children to do so.
The Emergency Medical Assistance Program implemented by the Philippine Department of Education  is an example of large-scale measures to strengthen children's health and raise children's education levels.
The national program is based on de-worming twice a year, as well as daily hand-washing with soap and daily fluoride toothbrushing.
The same program is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove the barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water alone is not considered an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollutants, are poorly soluble in water.
Sufficient water, however, helps the process of purification.
Hard soaps, because of their reuse, may also contain bacteria that could have been picked up by previous use.
A small number of studies on the skin exposure of bacteria from a contaminated piece of hard soap suggest that the likelihood of such exposure is low, since the bacteria wash off with the foam.
The CDC still states that "liquid hand-dose soap" is the preferred option for hand washing.
Antibacterial soaps are heavily promoted in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selectively affects organisms that are naturally resistant to antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective towards antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised one.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection products, the complex compounds may contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, lactic) as pH regulators, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other supports (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in terms of preventing disease and removing bacteria from the skin, simple soaps are as effective as conventional antibacterial soaps containing triclosan.
Hot water at a temperature comfortable for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, to remove the natural fats that hold back pollution and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand hygiene products that do not contain water (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand antiseptic disinfectants, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with thickeners such as carboomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerol in liquid or foam form, which provide convenience in using these products and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further enhances the antimicrobial activity, while disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effective in killing microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), the tuberculosis rod, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol hand sanitizers kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm reduction 3.5 similar to 35 decibel reduction) on hands within 30 seconds of application and 99.99%  99.999% of bacteria (logarithm reduction 45) on hands within 1 minute of application. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back surfaces of both palms and the space between the fingers are rubbed along the entire length for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is completely absorbed.
The tips of the fingers on both hands should also be washed thoroughly.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you choose handwashing over the use of disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The popularity of hand sanitizers is due to their ease of use and rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing when water and soap are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if they do not contain skin softeners and/or moisturizers.
The effects of alcohol-based skin drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening agents to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial washes.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are all but uncommon.
The lower risk of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in favor of using disinfectants over soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free products do not clean your hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, because the pathogens are still on the hands when hand sanitizers are used.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on the ingredients and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing hand sanitizers.
More recently, it has been shown that drugs using benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, in contrast to alcohol, which has been shown to lose its effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap, and they substitute ash or clay.
Clay or clay may be more effective than plain water, but they'll always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if the clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, in turn, increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend hand washing techniques that include the following steps:
Rinse your hands with warm or cold running water.
It's recommended that we use running water, because standing water can be polluted, and the temperature of the water doesn't matter.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, the area between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when people use soap (rather than just water) they tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Rinse your hands thoroughly under running water.
Handwashing in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and damp hands are more prone to contamination, and the areas most commonly neglected are the thumb, the wrist, the area between the fingers, and the area under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain a variety of microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or a pumpkin bottle with holes made and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries.In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-saving solutions such as tap-pedal taps and other inexpensive options.
A foot-pedal faucet is a simple construction consisting of a container suspended from a rope and a foot lever that is pressed to pour water onto the hands; a piece of soap is used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public restrooms.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many restrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on the production of paper towels and towels; the subject of this study was the comparison of the hygiene level of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow air hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increased by an average of 194%, and on the palms by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-dried dryer, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers increased by 42 percent, and on the palms by 15 percent.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on finger pads is reduced to 76%, and on the palms  to 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several toilet room visitors and the toilet environment with each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and from its own unit and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and the bathroom within a radius of up to 2 meters.
Using a hand dryer with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are often compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfecting wipes can be an alternative solution when traveling without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Zemmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing illnesses in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, using these devices actually helps to reduce the rate of infection.
A medical hand wash lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and scrub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together carefully, crossing the fingers.
If there is dirt under your nails, you can use a toothbrush to clean it.
Since germs can remain in the water, it is important to wash hands thoroughly and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying your hands, use a paper towel when closing the tap, and when closing and opening any doors if necessary.
This helps to avoid re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most health care facilities, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
One study found that proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet that outlines a standard hand washing and treatment regimen that should be used in the health sector.
The draft WHO Hand Hygiene Instructions are also available on the WHO website and are open for public comment.
The corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.
If compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure readings and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization identifies five times when it is necessary to wash your hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
Before using antiseptic, and before
After care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to hand soap (medical or antimicrobial soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgical procedures or in an environment with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms. To "wash" hands before surgery, a hand-washing faucet is required, which can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands; a little chlorhexidine or iodine water should also be used to rinse hands, a sterile towel to dry hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub, and another sterile tool to clean under the nails.
All the ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to rub your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearms should not be allowed to fall back on the hands.
After the wash, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from handwashing was the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was obtained when handwashing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared to antibacterial soap, hand washing with plain soap leads to more than a threefold increase in the incidence of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing hand scrubbing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that hand washing with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Hand hygiene measures in healthcare settings may include training of staff in hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and verbal reminders to staff to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a steady water, soap, or hand-washing product in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to develop the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has a hand-washing faucet, although there are inexpensive ways to arrange hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term changes in public behavior.
Monitoring and evaluation of the results is necessary to ensure that these measures are effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based surveillance is effective in improving hand hygiene in lower-middle income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of public education on hand-washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach, which promotes simple economic measures in schools to encourage hand-washing with soap and other hygiene practices.
By ensuring that the minimum standards are met, schools can raise their rating from one to three stars.
The installation of hand washers is one of the possible measures implemented as part of the information campaigns on hand hygiene to reduce the rate of morbidity and mortality in children.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of a public awareness campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emojis symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies have examined the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in comparison to DALYs (saved disability years of life).
However, one study suggests that encouraging handwashing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitation measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health  especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and the founder of modern patient care.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by putrid odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, with outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses and health care-associated infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States began promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "the correct handwashing technique" were hung next to handwashers in public restrooms, as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" means that you are not willing to take responsibility for or be a part of something.
It originates from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate washed his hands when deciding to crucify Jesus Christ; the phrase later found wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth involuntarily washes her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imagined stain, symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with crimes she has committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed an unethical act tended to wash their hands more often than others, and handwashers were more important to them.
People who had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing the image were also less likely to engage in any other "cleansing" or "compensating" activities, such as volunteering.
In religion, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided in many religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require that you wash your hands after using the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash one's hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
The control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the application of methods to ensure safety and health protection in order to control risk and combat the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control is location- and task-specific, based on risk assessment, community severity of the epidemic situation, and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and colleagues, and require basic infection control measures, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they show signs of illness, adhering to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfecting of the workplace.
Medium risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis but are at risk of infection due to the current spread of the disease in the community or during international travel.
This category may include workers who have contact with the public, for example in schools, in high-density work environments and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, use of protective screens and affordable personal protective equipment for contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that healthcare and mortuary personnel who have been in contact with a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk, with the risk increasing to very high when such personnel perform procedures involving aerosol formation or collection/processing of samples from a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
Risk control measures appropriate for such employees include the use of engineering safety measures, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the task.
An outbreak of COVID-19 can have a variety of impacts in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of infection.
Commercial patterns can vary both in the types of goods that are in demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g. shopping in off-peak periods with delivery or service without getting out of the car).
Finally, disruptions to the delivery of goods from COVID-19-affected geographical regions are possible.
The plans address issues of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and individual risk factors such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls necessary to deal with such risks, and the contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals of the response are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control means is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such means according to their effectiveness.
When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective engineering safety measures are followed by administrative measures and finally personal protective equipment.
Safety engineering implies isolating employees from work-related hazards and does not rely on the behavior of the worker, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or the employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected for the threat to the worker, be appropriate in size (e.g. respirators), be used consistently and properly, be regularly inspected, maintained in good condition and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers the lowest-risk jobs to have the least contact with the public and their coworkers.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, advising sick workers to stay home, respiratory etiquette, including hand-covering of mouth when coughing and sneezing, provision of handkerchiefs and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work when necessary, advising workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and cleaning and disinfecting work environments daily.
Early identification and isolation of individuals who may be potentially infected is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the fever, fever and many other symptoms have subsided for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other symptom-relieving medications, and requires flexibility in sick leave policies, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring that employees are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk positions require frequent and close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection but are likely to have SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community where the business is located or due to recent travel to the COVID-19 location.
Administrative measures for such a high-risk group include recommending that sick workers stay home, replacing in-person meetings with virtual communication, establishing work schedules, stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, developing high-efficiency air filters for such groups and for groups at higher risk, increasing ventilation intensity, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective screens, and installing windows for in-car customer service. Administrative measures for such a high-risk group and group include recommending that sick workers stay home, replacing in-person meetings with virtual communication, establishing work schedules, limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace by identifying the person with the highest risk, developing screen communication skills for the workplace, including the use of physical barriers such as protective screens, and installing windows for customer service without exiting the vehicle.
In rare cases, workers at risk may need to wear respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, measures such as keeping the sick person 6 feet away from other people, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person, providing the sick person with a mask, or asking the sick person to cover his nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure the safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick passenger or when in contact with bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should be subsequently cleaned and disinfected. In cases involving commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include postponing a trip in case of illness, self-isolation, and promptly informing the ship's medical center if there is a fever or other symptoms in anyone on board.
Ideally, the medical examination should be in the quarantined quarters of the individual. In the case of schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends that short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection be conducted if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In a community with a low or medium level of infection, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling outings for personal meetings, gatherings and other mass events, such as exercise or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between parties, regulating arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visits, using a separate health facility for children with flu symptoms.
With significant rates of community spread, long-term absence from school may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.For law enforcement personnel performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement personnel who are required to contact persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their uniforms and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures for disease prevention and disposal of used personal protective equipment, and for the use and laundering of clothing.
OSHA considers certain categories of healthcare and morgue workers to be at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who are in contact with patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They are at very high risk of infection when performing procedures that are accompanied by aerosol formation or when collecting/processing samples from individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures that result in aerosol include probing, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures, and invasive examinations or sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include those who handle the bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of death; if such employees perform an autopsy, they are classified as very high-risk. Additional safety engineering for such risk groups includes the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including procedures involving aerosol formation.
In some healthcare settings and mortuary, the use of special negative pressure ventilation may be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled with the precautions for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to segregated waiting areas depending on whether COVID-19 infection is suspected. OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection within 6 feet, as well as for those performing procedures that involve aerosol formation, in addition to other personal protective equipment.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved respirators for persons with an N95 or higher class filter must be used within a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection of equipment and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of protective clothing, as COVID-19  is a respiratory disease, not a fluid-borne disease.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the point of care.
For those who are collecting respiratory tract samples from COVID-19 patients or carriers without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, safety glasses or face shield, gown and gloves.
When performing procedures that involve the formation of aerosol, instead of a surgical mask, wear an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the global shortage of personal protective equipment, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment by using the capabilities of remote medicine, physical barriers, such as transparent windows, ensuring that only those providing immediate care are able to access a COVID-19 infected patient, using only the personal protective equipment that is necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it when working with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and recommending that masks not be used for people without symptoms.
The project is funded by the European Commission and the European Union.

TEMP: [Covid-19] Relieving the burden and preparing for the future
The following is a list of episodes for the television series The Wire.
CC0: No protected rights
This month we are living in extraordinary circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for these problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the capacity for empathy, cooperation and community development around the world that underpins this organization.
We have seen the camaraderie and caring among all our colleagues, which is reflected in the emails, calls and chats - a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
I speak with great gratitude and pride as a colleague.
I was told last week that our work was highly appreciated.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now, and how much better it would be for everyone to have online access to this critical resource.
And it's possible because of your work, whether it's keeping the sites up and running, paying our colleagues, or protecting the communities.
The world needs the information that is on Wikipedia, and it's more important than ever.
At a time like this, to achieve meaningful results for the world, it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important changes to our routine starting next week.
Adjusting our work order and schedules .
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the course of our conversation, we discussed our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to defuse the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, then so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
We expect to be working about four hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are issued.
We don't announce days off: if you can work normally for more hours, it is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is unpredictable now, and whatever your needs are, whether it's caring for your loved ones, buying groceries, or going to the doctor's appointment, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't keep track of your hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's obvious and undeniable, but we mention it.
No sick leave or leave is required: simply inform your supervisor and help the team to revise the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please contact Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and appropriate management attention to your situation.)
The hourly rate will be paid in full.
We have already announced and we are confirming our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Each man will be paid at the standard hourly rate applicable under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness during which you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can have amazing results, especially at times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask that you communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered essential.
These are the kinds of activities we should always support.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may require additional support.
We're initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to providing support that is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we're just focusing on the projects that matter most.
Delaying today doesn't mean negative consequences in the future.
We're not planning on working twice as hard to make up for lost time once the pandemic is over.
You don't have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What 's happening with the APP ?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing staff to prioritize critical work, self-care and family care, and providing a reduced schedule for those who need or want to work for the next few weeks.
This extension of deadlines reduces the current planning burden and strain on the entire organization.
Next week we'll present our proposal to the Council, which will brief delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we get the confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading the way.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to a number of precautions, we hired a virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a medical-grade antiseptic solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception halls and elevator shafts that access our floor.
The building has its own rules of care, using products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our District of Columbia (DC) office is on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all staff based in DC their COVID-19 policies.
Last week, our District of Columbia office went fully remote, following instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our New York colleagues know, we also discussed the issue of renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work remotely know that there are ways to fix this, and they'd like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider breaking them down into a course of several days.
Make the purpose of the meeting clear, set out the agenda, and send out the reference materials in advance.
By default, use video, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to interact and communicate.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator  someone who will monitor the arrival of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping notes (or joint consultation).
If you need to use a comfortable headset, contact the technical support service via e-mail.
Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement benefits when you buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics guides available in webinar format to promote distributed work efficiency throughout the organization.
Last week we asked all community grantees to cancel Wikimedia-funded mass events such as editathons until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such markings and other restrictions may result in the inability to conduct concerted grant activities, and no one will be penalised for forced delays or alteration of such targets.
We will be holding follow-up events with additional guidelines on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic community conferences in the coming week.
The general sentiment in the global community is not only sadness about the disruption but also a sense of relief about the understanding and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
Looking ahead, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide a community space to monitor impact and engagement.
We are in touch with COVID-19 issues.
We'll be sending an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we'll take the opportunity to share more up-to-date information, answer your questions, and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We're in this together, and we're willing to help anyone we can.
You can still get information from these emails and other important COVID-19 information from Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages, and all the information will be put together in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflows, problems with coverage or other assistance, contact the CRT.
We're ready to provide support and liaison as needed.
If you have privacy concerns, please email Bryan Judan , Director of HR International Global Operations.
Any such changes should not be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the possible current need for a radical re-adaptation of our work and our commitments.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that we can continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for the important work that lies ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
To make this happen, we need each and every one of you to help, and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with the utmost dedication when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The team is composed of Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), decreasing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid colletrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, its enzymatically active domain is on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular ACE2 domain is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most lung type II alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 andRNA biosynthesis is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE is the hormone that breaks down angiotensin I into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, cleavage the carboxyl end of the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyze it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, oralin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, the binding of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both virus and enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 carrier serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard therapy with ACE inhibitors and BACs.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of developing pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less robust than in patients at overall risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is proposed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure of 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classic inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 apps are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. to identify persons (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed, which are officially supported by the authorities.
Several variants of contact tracing applications have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially with respect to systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of application users.
More gentle options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join their efforts to integrate the functionality of supporting such applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has partnered with Alipay to roll out an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It's used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, there's an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by local IT companies, has open source code, and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-enabled app called StopKorona!, which helps track contacts of potentially infected people and provides a quick connection to health authorities.
The app was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app is in the final stages of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is considering using a geo-zoning app to keep COVID-19 patients living in Moscow from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at Cambridge University, points out a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false starts and potential inefficiency if only a small fraction of the population uses the application.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus apps", Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps on the App Store to only "official" or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question has been raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions they would impose on government projects:
The monitoring shall be lawful, necessary and proportionate;
the extension of monitoring and surveillance shall be accompanied by a reservation on the limitation of the period of validity;
the use of data should be limited to the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties must be defined at the legislative level;
protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to address the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as the need for it is no longer there.
In some countries, instead of apps, network location tracking is used, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have big potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
South Korea has used a system that doesn't use apps as a foundation to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transactions, and then combined them to create text-based notifications that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government has not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts of infected individuals, but has also made location information publicly available, made possible by significant changes to information protection legislation that were introduced after the MERS outbreak in the country.
The information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized systems and systems that preserve privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been made public.
Privacy-preserving contact tracking is an established concept, with a significant body of research literature on it dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-providing solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordinated efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preserving tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), privacy-preserving protocols, mobile contact tracing mechanisms (PACT), and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches are made on the device.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to ensure privacy when location or path data is collected and used to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform's work is based on research from the March 2020 paper Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, a global TCN coalition was formed by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened up the BlueTrace source code used in its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed will provide privacy, and is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption to preserve privacy.
They also published the technical specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deploying tools to allow governments to create official apps to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data privacy
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address the problems with constant surveillance, first by implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Drug repositioning (also known as re-targeting, re-targeting, task re-targeting, or therapeutic drug re-targeting) is the re-targeting of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition other than the disease originally intended.
This is one of the areas of research currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADF-ribophosphate.
Hussein A.A. and co-authors in their preclinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chlohexin is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being studied in a clinical trial called "Solidarity".
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of sulfate of hydroxychloroquine and phosphate of chloroquine under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under the clinical trial regimens.
The CDC stated that the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there's no other option".
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is studying the safety and effectiveness of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients who took the drug had a negative result after an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug had a duration of 11 days.
A study was conducted in Wuhan, China, involving 240 patients with pneumonia, half of whom were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results of the drug's efficacy were scarce and should not be considered conclusive.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan to replenish its stockpile and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has informed the Trump administration of the possibility of purchasing the drug, which may be less effective in advanced cases.
It may not be safe for patients who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.
One study of the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinvir and ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that the efficacy of the drugs was not established.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO has included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in an international trial called "Solidarity".
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies indicate that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two conducted by University Hospitals of Cleveland; one in patients with moderate disease and one in patients with more severe disease.
There are currently three clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19: two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the first trials of the antibiotic azithromycin were conducted in New York State.
The Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teigin, an inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for its use in treating pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
The Phase II trial, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is being conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe disease to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The COLCORONA study involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and non-use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible for participation in this study.
Several coagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
On 14 April, a multi-center study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to investigate the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China. The drug is also approved in the United States.
Also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine  is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it does not expect a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available for use for at least 18 months.
In April, five candidate vaccines were in Phase I safety trials.
The COVID-19 virus was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread across the world, leading to significant investment in vaccine development and research activities related to it.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key goals of the CEPI vaccine initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under development and research at the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main goals of the platform included in the Phase I safety studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, and RNA-1273)
viral vector (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
CEPI scientists reported in April that 115 potential vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 of which are in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 candidate vaccines have been announced, but little public information is available (presumably in planning or development).
In stages I-II, preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity is performed, generally randomised, placebo-controlled and in multiple sites with simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing disease and side effects are monitored at the same time at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (all still in preclinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular-clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the goal of starting human testing in 2021.

The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in the fast-track mode, it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, announced that it had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institut de la Recherche en Santé.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "big money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government objected to.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on iRNA.
BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials, with clinical trials to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive pre-clinical trial results in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate drug could begin human testing as early as autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, and the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates in animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced that it would allocate C$275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million fund specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice, stating that MNA injected subunit vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization.
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be available in the form of a nasal spray.
With bacteriophages, the DNA will replicate inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM's supercomputers with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits besides disease prevention.
Another randomized study is being conducted in Australia, involving 4,170 health-care workers.
Vaccines may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models that are characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, indicate the need for biosafety level 3 infection containment measures when handling live viruses, as well as international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models.
As of 2020, there is no drug or vaccine for SARS that is safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health institutions worldwide.
When MERS first emerged, it was believed that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine for MERS that had passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were in development, two adenoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
A conspiracy theory was circulating on social media that COVID-19 is not a new virus, and that a vaccine already exists.
Social media posts cited some patients as claiming patents exist on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as on vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus  is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild, but some cases may develop into viral pneumonia and polyorgan failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people have died from the disease.
The virus is mainly spread by close contact between people, often through microscopic droplets released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are produced by exhalation, they are usually dangerous when they hit the ground or a surface, but they are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on a surface for 72 hours.
It is most infectious within the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and in later stages. The standard method of diagnosis is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a swab from the nasopharynx.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease and for those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks vary from state to state, with some agencies recommending not to use them at all, others recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may have no symptoms or may have symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, bruising of the face or lips; if any of these symptoms are present, seek immediate medical attention.
Less commonly, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease may be observed, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.
Also, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are observed in different proportions.
Some cases reported in China initially showed only chest tightness and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear within 11.5 days of infection, although not all people are known to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown, and is only being studied; however, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily tally from 1 April; of the 166 infections reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both the feces and saliva can have high concentrations of the virus.
When you speak loudly, more droplets are released into the air than when you speak at a normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore found that when coughing openly, the droplets could spread up to 15 feet (4.5 m).
The virus is not normally transmitted through the air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of the air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside of people's rooms showed the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, can result in the spraying of breath products and, therefore, the spread of the virus through the air.
There is also concern that the virus may be spread through faeces, however this risk is considered low.The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; it may be spread before symptoms appear, but this risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one person infecting a person can infect 2-3 people, and the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus is able to live on a cardboard surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These values, however, vary with humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used properly, have quite a useful effect in terms of infection control: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and is also able to remove it from skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus.
Five of the six patients had the highest viral load on the first day of testing, and the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory illnesses registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in its relatives in nature, the coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks open its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs  This is the organ most vulnerable to COVID-19, as the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II lung alveolar cells.
The virus binds to ACE2 and enters the host cell by means of the characteristic surface glycoprotein  shipa (peplomer).
Twelve percent of the people who were hospitalized in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial injury, which is more common in severe cases.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders seen during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are found in large numbers in the heart because they are involved in the function of the heart.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in ICU with COVID-19, and may indicate an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is tropic to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T-cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also found at the autopsy.
WHO has also published several protocols for testing for this disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples taken from a nasal swab, but a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results are not immediately significant.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and published its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were under development but not yet widely available.
Chinese experience with these tests has shown that they are only 60 to 70 percent accurate.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first test for onsite diagnosis, giving permission for its use later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outline methods of detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-doll subpleural focuses of the type matomatous glass with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterious distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of the limestone bridge (a longitudinal thickening of the partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
Little is known about the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed during the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, thickening and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of severe viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multi-nucleated giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: the organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVS); leuko-eritroblastic reaction; and
Preventative measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or, if there is no tissue, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow area.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that you perform a good hand hygiene procedure.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of cloth face masks in public places, particularly to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed, citizens' movement restricted, and large public events canceled.
The distancing guidelines also require people to stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
There are no medications with proven efficacy against COVID-19 and, since the vaccine is not expected to be completed until 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as "plateauing".
The CDC also recommends washing your hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if you have severe hand contamination, as well as before eating and after blowing a nose, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (with an alcohol content of  at least 60%) but only when soap and water are unavailable.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol, which has antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive care, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they may have the virus wear a standard medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle, and a healthy diet are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supportive therapies may be indicated for patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.WHO and China's National Health Commission published guidelines for the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
In the US, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource  IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptom management as a first-line drug, some health care professionals recommend that you choose paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures that may involve airborne droplet release, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings.
For healthcare workers caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that they place in air-drop isolation (AIIR) - an additional precaution in addition to standard contact and air precautions.
Personal protective equipment: protective clothing, respirators or medical masks, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when not used as directed, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, as a last resort, making your own at home.
In most cases, the course of COVID-19 is not severe enough to require ventilation or its alternatives, but there is a percentage of cases where this is necessary.
A type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, with some evidence in favor of avoiding intubation with a nasal oxygen cannula with intensive airflow or double-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these two approaches is as effective for critically ill patients as the IUD.
Some doctors opt for invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to nasal cannulas with an intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for the elderly (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there are insufficient hospital beds per capita, and health systems are too limited in resources to cope with the rapidly increasing number of severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 percent of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The challenge of providing ventilation is becoming more challenging as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops with COVID-19, and oxygenation are becoming more of a problem.
Pressure-supported inhalation and VCI are necessary to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to minimize ventilation damage, which can lead to pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high PQEDs may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is remdesivir.
The development of new drugs may take until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe disease.
Volunteers recommended by the WHO participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval for the use of reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or imminent danger to human life.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials that are required to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.
To log in, users must enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect 'close contact' from the surveillance data and therefore identify potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence  such tools are being used to track infected people and the people they have come in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave security authorities permission to track the mobile phone data of people who are suspected to be infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, for the purpose of researching and preventing the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided aggregated data on the location of cell phone subscribers to German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallerà, said that mobile phone operators report that "40% of people are still moving around the country".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, with over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are ideal conditions for harm to people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical disease may require three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In people with the most severe disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and problems with the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal clotting, especially an increase in prothrombin time, was reported in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while impaired kidney function was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in hospital.
However, the median time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to studies of early cases, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, and among women  1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples suggests diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lung was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 percent of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart problems were due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had preexisting health problems.The availability of medical resources and socio-economic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary by condition due to such regional differences, as well as because of methodological difficulties.
Insufficient effective case counting in the mild form can lead to an excess mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths are due to diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms overall, and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics found that some patients who recovered from the disease had reduced lung volume by 20-30 percent, and their scans showed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients who had recovered from the virus developed resistant immunity against it.
Judging from the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where after recovery from COVID-19, tests for the coronavirus still turned out to be positive.
These cases are thought to have been exacerbated by a protracted course of the disease, rather than re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal-based, and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, cites December 1, 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is  8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of onset, but are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health care systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the disease an emergency code under ICD-10: U07.1  for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2  for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2 240,191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality ratio (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, and determining the infection-related mortality ratio (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of a particular population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, the presence of these antibodies can help to determine how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castelone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spreading during carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health care system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, according to the blood donation rate.
COVID-19  official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and death rates are different for men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The group most at risk  are men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women narrows only after the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, concomitant diseases in men (e.g. hypertension, which appears in men at a younger age than in women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government does not maintain gender statistics for COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS have different gender statistics.
The majority of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and therefore they are more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially announced the name of this disease  COVID-19.
The WHO chief, Mr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explains: CO means corona, VI virus, D disease, and 19 years old when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO additionally uses the terms virus COVID-19 and virus responsible for COVID-19.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official names  COVID-19 and  SARS-CoV-2 were published.
Due to the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials such as nasal swabs and parts for inhalers.
In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it on time, so one of the local factories was re-profiled and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 began, various conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake information about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the virus have been spreading rapidly online.
Humans may be able to pass the virus on to other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine or drug for the virus.
Various international studies of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial, a program to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective today.
There is no ready-made vaccine, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through the ACE2 receptor, so previous studies of SARS-CoV have been used in scientific studies.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are looking to create a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether in an inactive or dead form, is aimed at triggering a rapid immune response in humans to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine development, aims to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focus on the destruction of the S-spike protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new methodology for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine in four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-induced boosting has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of these studies were on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Over-profiling of antiviral drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for this purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there are no preliminary data on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China, and Italy.The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitasoxanide was recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. The study showed that the alignment of the spike protein with the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is required for SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.Ozeltavir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytocinemia may occur as a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercyclinemia properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug has entered phase 2 of a non-randomized trial, which is being conducted nationally in Italy, after it had positive results in patients with severe disease.
When combined with serum ferritin testing for cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors believed to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is currently considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but the results were inconclusive.
Viral neutralization  is an expected effect through which passive antibody therapy may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using engineered monoclonal antibodies, are in the developmental stages.
The use of recovering serum, which is made up of the fluid blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, could be expanded.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of syndromes with a high degree of similarity
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Clinic who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after reporting the virus spread.
