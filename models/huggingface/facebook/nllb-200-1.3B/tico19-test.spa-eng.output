Accumulated rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases demonstrates similar trends in the European Union or European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients that will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical illness requiring intensive care.
Mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each country in the European Union or European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the COVID-19 case counts reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the countries' Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days; in this way we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK
Trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK exhibited similar upward trends in cumulative COVID-19 incidence (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that, as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the different stages countries are at, variations in national public health responses and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for confirming COVID-19, including delayed testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10 percent of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 201011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100 000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100 000 inhabitants in 2010).11
Model scenarios for healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a risk of > 90% overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since case conglomerations have so far been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and ICUs normally serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and ICUs should preferably be made available at the level of Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as is occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC rapid risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3000 people and infected more than 80 000 in China and other parts of the world, creating a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this analysis will help us understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgettable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40 000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients deceased.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the public enemy number 1 and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the isolated virus sequence from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarise the progress made in research into this rapidly developing new subject.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some crucial questions that have yet to be answered.
Coronavirus have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third coronavirus recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. Fig. 1,1, pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first reported on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infection from health care providers was reported, suggesting human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan city was quarantined and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the site of origin of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 other countries worldwide (fig. 2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 spread in conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The baseline reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single-directional chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan seafood market of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of human respiratory epithelium.
It was determined that human ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the cryomicroscopic electron structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution, in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug studies to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96 percent identical to two bat-like SARS-like coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission remains unclear.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that pangolins (long-nosed, ant-eating mammals commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99 percent genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference spread over the whole of two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited which provide concrete evidence (fig. (fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been announced.
Consequently, we can only refer to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of interferons type I (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
Cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complementary substances such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerate occurrence, is more likely to affect older persons with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described earlier, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time to the most accurate incubation period; this will prevent asymptomatic infected persons from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulation.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study from late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dysnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by transmission from an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80 per cent of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the higher mortality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%, with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and rising to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only ranging between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethal rate is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within a single family or from a single meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients in the two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from hospital may contract the virus again, signaling an alarm that the quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have normal or reduced peripheral blood white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of < 4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of < 1×109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase were observed in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the chest X-rays of most COVID-19 patients, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacities in glazed glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction decreases surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings on chest X-rays are usually parallel to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the epitheliation of pneumocytes, formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of a viral infection and ARDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which were no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a graduated rod in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors are mostly able to provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table (table 2).2).
These therapies include currently or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as those in the digestive tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory assistance is therefore critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMOC) assistance, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokin storm is known to be the result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals which are the main cause of ARDS and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 anti-receptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are T-cell-directed immune response modulation; blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of cytokine signaling pathway 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis significantly.
However, prudent use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids over a short period of time has been recommended for patients with critical COVID-19.
To date, no antiviral therapy has been confirmed to be effective.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19 has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The blood drawing of patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and they recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, this needs to be verified and clarified in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, potentially producing lethal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is normally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It's difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or look for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or are imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used MCT in only about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with the combined treatment of WM and MCT.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, symptom resolution and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of symptom worsening (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCTs still await further well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause further anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential effective vaccines to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate potent, long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live attenuated viruses in animal models have been evaluated for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older persons and lethal stimulation models and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses has yet to be determined before a clinical trial is initiated.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
However, there are still sporadic cases and clusters of MERS in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits have been developed, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognostic model for disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (table (table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also accurate for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably older than those not requiring them (with an average age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a predictive factor in the evolution of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 vs. 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation between PCR level and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the course of the patient.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They are therefore traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As the use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS was widespread, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long periods in quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, as happens with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, early-stage or incubation-period infected patients may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, making epidemic control extremely difficult.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while transmission mostly did not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been causing considerable damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be over by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclical episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in feces, raising a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by infections in hospitals, which includes 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even passers-by in contact with infected patients or people.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or sticking to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
As particulate matter can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear tailor-made isolation coats to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; it is possible that the virus entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear protective masks or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine, and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens by saying that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity between humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly eased public alarm, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this harsh lesson and make decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, as every word matters to citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive in containing a possible epidemic in its early phase, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing tailored and effective drills to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases and periodically test and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the feeling of SARS reappearing.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10,91 % vs 1,44 %).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even though they do not show symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so when they are seriously ill, which makes it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively stop the transmission, and the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it spreads between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, go extinct like SARS, or periodically resurface like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, at all costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronavirus and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronavirus back in the spotlight and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and we would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, in which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
Investigating interactions between coronavirus and hosts in animals could, furthermore, throw important information about the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and species-to-species transmission.
Notably, we compared and contrasted the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of positive enveloped monocatenary RNA viruses.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were named coronavirus because of their morphology, for the shape of the corona they have under an electronic microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyprotein replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins from each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
On the basis of the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes for most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 normally cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people, with a crude mortality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91 000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which the viruses are well adapted and are not pathogenic, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and the restricting factors of the jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and animal hosts intermediate and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, species-to-species transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlighted and analyzed the common theme that the parental viruses of human coronavirus are normally not pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after transmission from species to a new host.
We also examined the evolutionary trend of human coronavirus, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the last few decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passing in lactating mouse brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, caused the first well-documented pandemic caused by a human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could result in approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and difficulty breathing as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated creatine kinase levels are common abnormal results in laboratory tests for SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from open-air lung biopsy from a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to researching human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was determined to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of cortex, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory illnesses.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional close contact have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among human coronavirus-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been recorded, with a high mortality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses to humans known.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and further termed the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude mortality of 3.4%.
Notably, the mortality rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which presents as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high 82% nucleotide sequence homology, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and duration of the human coronavirus disease course are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are more frequently observed in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presentation of nonspecific or mild symptoms or, even, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is somewhat smaller.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is, at least, as high as that of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing between humans, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, has yet to be elucidated in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after passing between humans, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-acquired human coronaviruses that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronavirus that cause serious illness in humans and humans that developed serious illness from human coronavirus have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the greater the likelihood that it will adapt completely to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired coronaviruses have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and to the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It's highly transmissible like community-acquired human coronaviruses, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir animal host or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus continuously and long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the role of amplifier host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial SARS case had been in contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence research indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, civets from wild or farm masked palm trees without exposure to live animal markets were reported to be mostly SARS-CoV negative, suggesting that masked palm civets would only act as an amplifier intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, given that 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as SARS-CoV amplifier intermediate hosts cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a fecal bat sample was shown to use ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, the serums of convalescing SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally believed not to be the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Based on phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat-HKU4 CoV and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to their bat betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as are camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but massive spread of the virus in camels infected for MERS-CoV investigations.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of bat virus spread.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from bats Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of practically identical bats.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also harbor ancestral SARS-CoV-2 related betacoronavirus.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In marked contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are more divergent, despite a greater degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contents in lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used various methods of assembly and manual curing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronavirus.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronavirus.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronavirus and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronavirus.
No conclusion has yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Apalachee Mountain coronavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the knowledge so far of the animal origins of known human coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human-to-human coronavirus transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not known with such precision.
Bat alphacoronavirus have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related bat alphacoronavirus are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause human disease, such as the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising if bats transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronavirus acts as a genetic pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, specifically in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of species-to-species transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is clear that bats, with their rich collection of virus species, contribute to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and great flight capability are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus spreaders".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It's well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host, to being a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is accidental and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronavirus are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2 related betacoronavirus, as civets are in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for species-to-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through killing or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts into which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through killing and eating game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating that coronaviruses cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronavirus could be considered moderate to high, with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronavirus have a reading-checking exorribonuclease, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotidic analog remdesivir suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronavirus are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Also, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Hopefully, it's already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Second, the long RNA genome of coronavirus exerts additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the probability of coevolution between species, which favors the appearance of new coronaviruses when the right conditions are given.
This is backed up by the copious unique open reading frames and functions of the proteins encoded toward the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses change templates randomly and frequently during RNA replication by a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing vehicle, chain switching occurs frequently during coronavirus RNA transcription.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Phyllogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing species-to-species transmission.
At present, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of a coronavirus's S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is selected intensely by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found at amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing for cross-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from isolated human and civet virus strains in the RBD and 4 of them are in the receptor binding motif for ACE2 receptor interaction.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for the virus' adaptation to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 percent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates 10 to 20 times greater affinity of this bond compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correceptor might be necessary for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetyl in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, following species-to-species transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of human coronavirus is also determined by other host-dependence and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to species-to-species transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host-dependent factors and subvert host-restriction factors for interspecies transmission to be successful.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction have yet to be identified and characterised.
A full genome objective investigation of host-dependent and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could prove useful.
New human coronavirus: starting from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic archive of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but it was determined that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
Elimination of 29 nucleotides characteristic of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated strains at the onset of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified.
Recombination locations in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14 were also identified.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to undergo recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses recombine with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting in releasing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 was observed in HCoV-229E-related bats and camels, the alpaca alphacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, which causes a change in framework.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
Apparently, bats are well adapted to coronavirus anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduces the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitory receptor and low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the checking of exorribonuclease reading, which brings the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronavirus are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is the secret to why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
Instead, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of unlinking the immune response could have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus has been found to share a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been determined to harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin betacoronavirus have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin betacoronavirus could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronavirus have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human-to-human coronavirus in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several betacoronavirus lineages of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to slaughter all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, they're circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity presents itself to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, opportunities for human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if the population is educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and its natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, how humans come into contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent viruses are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of the suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide included our experience and is a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guideline and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria for suspect case and confirmed case according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advice guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., who submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological history with two points of the clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis, or three points of the clinical manifestations must be met if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious SARS-CoV-2 cases (positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as the home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features in imaging of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any pathogenic or serological test characteristic as follows: (1) positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to recognized new coronaviruses; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase in titer ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for detecting nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, serological testing was added to the seventh edition.
The following
In addition, there is a growing body of evidence reminding us that we should be cautious with both asymptomatic and atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of both suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend that you seek and follow the latest guidelines in your home countries.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 yesterday in one day.
That's the most deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of infected cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until this coming Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel, and food, was still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, involving two men who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases yesterday, including 79 332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m. Central European Time (UTC-0800) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Countries around the world announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfews were only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and one pack per transaction at all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the one-pack limit.
These limitations were posted as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
According to reports, consumers were stocking up for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced following the previous four-pack per transaction restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, "many supermarkets still sell out within an hour of delivery", and said the demand "was unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales rose with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock available for a planned Wednesday special offer in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but the local council's restrictions on truck delivery schedules are making it difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer supplies.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stock, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that supermarkets stock up every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there was an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could be [bought] and there were large quantities, there would probably be a minimum of panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they ran out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time on the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-based print newspaper, included an eight-page cover designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on shopping.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In statements published by CNN in February he stated, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the continued worldwide spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time", he added.
The new pandemic status comes after the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case fatality rate was estimated at 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation of people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus was spread over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation was initiated.
The cases were mostly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus was thought to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person known to have manifested symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group in the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei Province, may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had, for the first time, exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would need to be infected before effective mass immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 tests, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of the cases recorded.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without being tested, for example, in their homes, nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is an underestimate", a claim corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the United States. This underestimation is frequent in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths from cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with onset of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed persons who died from a disease, and the infection fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a fixed time frame and consider a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall mortality rate from pandemic infections is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on case-by-case estimates of the mortality rate.
WHO claims the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University stated, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But, at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen".
The Chinese government's top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said that "it could end in June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, expressed that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it's so easily transmitted, will go away completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the re-emergence would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of sputum in the airways (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pressure or pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish coloration of the face or lips; upon manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although test results confirm infection, so the researchers advised to carefully monitor and screen those who have close contact with confirmed infected individuals to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is one to 14 days; more frequently it is 5 days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is thought that the disease is spread mainly during close contact and through the small droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered to be a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies show that when you cough without covering your mouth, the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced during exhalation, even when speaking, although, generally, the virus is not transmitted through the air.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolisation of respiratory secretions and therefore airborne spread.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at more advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but, some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, it usually infects one person to two or three others.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the UK authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have touched infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the betacoronavirus genus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the full genome level, it is 96 percent identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only a difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, full genome comparison indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share, at most, 92 percent of the genetic material, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by CT imaging.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using CT as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab can also be used.Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been shown to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the USA, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-ray and CT images of symptomatic persons include asymmetrical peripheral glazed opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained from imaging of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed polymerase chain reaction imaging has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT scans of the chest with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that while imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and with CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the community spread phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they became infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and wear eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwash gargles are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an establishment, such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs that have been used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a disposable handkerchief for coughing or sneezing, and that they throw the handkerchief away immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as wearing a mask may limit the volume and distance traveled by the breathing droplets that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene".[23] Wearing masks has also been recommended for people caring for someone who might have the disease.
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transportation or being in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear masks when in public spaces so that they can protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government required masks from all people entering a supermarket.
Israel has requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured 10 million masks a day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded that passengers on interurban trains and buses wear masks.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks for going outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who cannot afford them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to curb the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
People can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments are now requiring or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay at home as much as possible in areas of the community affected by the outbreak.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
They include recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with, who doesn't have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation.Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine of entire populations in affected areas.
Stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those in high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, in addition to introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer controllable, efforts move to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic through reducing the basic number of reproductions to less than 1. Part of controlling an outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, mask use and self-quarantine; community-oriented physical distancing measures, such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning.In China, more drastic measures aimed at containing the outbreak were taken once its severity became apparent, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which slows the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but should be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), otherwise transmission is rapidly reactivated when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "homemade and traditional remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes capacity building and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for resource redistribution at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling optional procedures when possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories about where the first case (called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus may date back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed which were taken care of by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
The police cautioned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for sounding the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed the WHO.
In early January, enough cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to start an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributed by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and an important railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data shows that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
By March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on December 27.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a health cordon banning travel in and out of Wuhan was announced on January 23, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in various regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement controls were implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restriction on outdoor activities.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case had been transmitted nationally in mainland China in the previous five days, this time through a traveller returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, as well as Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national moment of silence on 4 April at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online to comply with physical distancing in order to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health body reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the church's 9,336 followers, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected, and therefore modified. South Korea introduced what was considered the world's most comprehensive and best-organized program to test for the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identify and quarantine those who came into contact with them.
Detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new arrivals from other countries via a mobile app, drive-thru centres to conduct virus detection tests with results available the next day, and increased diagnostic capacity to test up to 20 000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized regarding President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon's ouster for what they considered to be the government's poor handling of the outbreak, or to praise his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad will be required to remain in quarantine for two weeks.

Iran has allocated five billion riyals to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Nowruz year continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a centre of virus spread after China.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had tracked their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down, and on March 3, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had tested positive for the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He said there is a greater risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 former or incumbent Iranian politicians had died of the disease.
As of 23 March, Iran was experiencing 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, Iran may have five times as many cases as are reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the easing of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise rapidly, leading the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50 000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "No entry or exit will be allowed from the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events in those areas has already been ordered". On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities across the country as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were due to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethical recommendations on the triage protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy's combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from home when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gyms, and pledged to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, the police could enforce these restrictions by imposing fines and dispersing the meetings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the principal public health institute of the U.S. Government, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in conducting testing, which hid the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was hampered by defective test kits produced by the Federal Government in February, the lack of approval by the Federal Government of non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until late February and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March (after which a medical order was required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.

Belgium withdrew 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the epidemic.
WHO pointed to the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while "it was definitely not a recommendation that WHO has made", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that it "has no precedent in the history of public health". On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEI) since the sixth PHEI that was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that ISRS was due to "the risk of worldwide spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On February 5, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, should they have them".
Tedros also made statements in which he affirmed that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On February 11, the WHO announced in a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros claimed that the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, had agreed to bring the "power of the entire UN system into the response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed for the coordination of the response from all the United Nations, which WHO says will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to address the broader social, economic and developmental consequences of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organisation of workshops and meetings with key institutions at national level and to conduct site visits to assess the "impact of provincial and county-level response activities, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", and noted that although it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nonetheless be in a "preparedness phase".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared", insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a declaration would mean that "we are basically accepting that every human being on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The director-general said that the WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".[22] The WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733 000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed that the rights of all people should be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all people have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, persons in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and is intended to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were dismissed for their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, dismissed a previous acknowledgement of the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and claimed that "China's censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction from his administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a cable from the US government describing a communications ploy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "All about China".
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances".Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also called for the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, US sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reported disputes over masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.'
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to respond if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a reduced scale.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate".[22] The Iranian government was severely affected by the virus, with around two dozen members of Parliament infected, in addition to fifteen other current and former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, and said his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the US sanctions on Iran. The outbreak spurred demands that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election chances in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts", after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized about Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon's removal for what they considered to be the government's poor handling of the outbreak, or to praise his response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it might allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and sanction those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for several cases of supply shortages, as a consequence of the increased use of equipment worldwide to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions to logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left shelves empty of essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, leading to shortages of supplies.
The technology sector in particular has been warning of delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100 times.
This demand led to a price increase of up to 20 times the normal price and also led to delays of four to six months in the supply of medical articles.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
Measures by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, and have prevented an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy, similar laws require food producers to keep reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a news report on March 16, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges about the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 20022004 SARS outbreak.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the impact on world supply chains could be over $300 billion and last up to two years.
Reportedly, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "revolved" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.

On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their steepest declines since 2008, the Dow dropped 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
All three indexes ended the week with losses of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH claimed the sovereign credit rating of China but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on the basis of fears over the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurring on March 16.
Many consider that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures by states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, closure of public places including travel attractions and government recommendations not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions independently, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of 50 to 60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to monitor shoppers' temperature, and cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed.According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment.Around 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German short-term labour compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organisations and individuals, both employed and self-employed, worldwide.
Organisations in the cultural and arts sector tried to fulfil their mission (often publicly funded) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly increasing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disruptions, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home instead of attending mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live Internet or television, while others offer prayer spaces from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled for a later date in 2020 but not after the summer of 2021".[21] Casinos and other gaming venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online gambling sites reported significant increases in their new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous internet memes about the coronavirus were spread, as many resorted to humor and distraction amid the uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world who expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a just retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the virus-affected areas have received support, both online and offline.
Following the spread of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported higher levels of racist insults, in addition to assaults.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The chairman of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, expressed that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said they were "erroneous".[33] In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and destined for "waste".[34]
Many newspapers with pay walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests performed in different countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting the reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase test performed on pharyngeal swabs is reliable only in the first week of disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or material that is expelled by coughing (sputum) may be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was conducted at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis for the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of the clinical-grade polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration of a polymerase chain reaction-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel for the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus to public health laboratories via the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a jam in conducting testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only from then on were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of tests for COVID-19 based on the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase.
Similarly, as of March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made tests for COVID-19 available nationwide.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Care Surveillance.[citation needed] On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.[citation needed] On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on large volumes, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "thoracic X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [CT] results can be obtained even before symptoms appear".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in unlit glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, pattern in stonying and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using CT as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".[5] As of March 2020, the CDC recommends polymerase chain reaction as the initial test.
Part of the immune system's response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people from approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance.
High performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For tests in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood specimen is usually used, although serial samples may be used to follow the immune response.
For point-of-care testing, a single blood sample is usually obtained by a skin puncture.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required prior to analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of infection.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody testing kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for specimen", the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result in no time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if they go to hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In tests at drive-through centres for COVID-19 of suspected cases, a health professional takes the samples taking proper precautions.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and that 10,700 people had been tested the week before.
The health insurance covers the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160 000 tests a week.
As of 19 March, drive-through testing was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, by the calendar week of 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested in total, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) yielded positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples from 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only doing more tests if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, BGI inaugurated a 2000 square meter improvised emergency detection laboratory called "H-Yanchino" (Yanchino: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process up to 10,000 more samples per day.
With construction, which was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost of quarantine would have doubled without this testing capacity.
After the Wuhan lab, Huo-Yan labs were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow up to 1122 patient samples to be evaluated for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid-handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the USA.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection testing per person in its population than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and purchasing a population-level mass production laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (which was based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside China.
Different test formulas that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, delaying available tests in the United States.[citation needed] China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet demand and recommendations from health experts on testing.
On the contrary, experts say that South Korea's large availability of tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean Government has achieved its capacity to conduct tests, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the US, and supplies of hisopads and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were useless.
Testing, supplemented by quarantine of those who obtained positive results and identification of people who had been in contact with those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death from COVID-19 in Italy occurred, conducted two rounds of tests on the entire population of around 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days difference.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were quarantined.
With travel restrictions in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries, but which did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began recommending residents to stay at home, but schools reopened on time after the 23 March holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracing, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent containments, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to one statistical study, countries that have done more testing, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries have a better ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column  Positive as % of tests is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who come into hospitals will have a higher positive rate as a % of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest of the issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing one's hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, for example if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecating, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hand washing can be done with ash.
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a kid who used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections.
And reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can lead to small improvements in the growth in height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be linked to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as a self-regulating behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand-washing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom a long-standing habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning a child's tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper handwashing techniques should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries concluded that, on average, 38.7% of households practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was about half at 77%, and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavior change, to increase the adoption of the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Group handwashing of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate handwashing into children's behavior.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a tailor-made action to promote children's health and education.
Disinfection twice a year, in addition to washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water makes cleaning easier.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is unlikely, since the bacteria wash themselves with foam.
Still, the CDC says that "liquid soap with hand-free controls is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted for a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence that using recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant organism strains.
Thus, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as consumer antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
The pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a waterless hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, waterless and alcohol-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubbing solution, antiseptic hand rubbing solution, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases the antimicrobial activity, and hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol effectively kill germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants for rubbing eliminate bacteria, various drug-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand sanitizers are used to rub, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless water and soap are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry the skin unless skin emollients or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol-based hand rub solutions are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and the formula, and historically has been much smaller than that of alcohol and alcohol-based rubbing solutions.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and instead use ashes or soil.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The proper hand-washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Crouch for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and scrubbing for longer periods of time eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a dish can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish may harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several economical options can be used to facilitate hand washing when no running water or soap is available, for example, pouring water from a hanging can or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as "home taps" and other economical options.
A homemade faucet is a simple technology that involves using a pitcher suspended from a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Increasing research indicates that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the paper towel industry association European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels offered by more modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to have increased, on average, by 194 percent in the fingertips and by 254 percent in the palms.
Air-jet drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42 percent in the fingertips and 15 percent in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76 percent in the fingertips and 77 percent in the palms.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds reportedly of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
Using a hot-air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 metres away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer towels is an alternative during travel, when no water or soap is available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing by doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Doctors wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to foam and scrub all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by entangling the fingers.
If there are debris under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in healthcare settings is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organisation's hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soaps "medicinal" or "antibacterial") gives it the possibility of being eliminated by the hand washing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it, some chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush for scrubbing, and another sterilized instrument for cleaning under your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water from the forearms should not return to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical robe is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after treating sick people.
To control staph infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand-washing has been found to be in the first 20% of washing and very little additional benefit is obtained when hand-washing frequency increases by more than 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution to hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26 percent more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands than alcohol-based hand sanitizers.[citation needed] Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an inexpensive and fundamental tool for good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or handwashing facilities at home, school and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal handwashing behaviours.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand washing faucets near public or private toilets, although there are economical options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates may also be the result of ingrained habits and not lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and bring about long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns to reduce childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that tries to achieve a behavioural change.As a consequence of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF pushed for the creation of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided ADAs.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as new mothers or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, signs with "correct hand-washing techniques" were hung next to the sinks of public toilets and bathrooms in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "wash your hands" is a statement of not wanting to take charge of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origins in the biblical passage from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing items more.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, with water but without soap, is part of the ritual hand washing in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilá and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, the lavatory in Christianity and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend hygienic hand washing, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after going to the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
Workplace risk controls in the face of COVID-19
Workplace risk controls in the face of COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work assignment and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal workplace contact with the public and coworkers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommending workers to stay home if sick, respiratory hygiene standards, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by current community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, workplaces with high concentrations of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and individual protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral workers, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, are at high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or handle samples from these people.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are ill, have to care for others, or are afraid of exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which goods are demanded and the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying at off-peak times, through home delivery services or by car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and individual workers' risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak response include reducing transmission between staff, protecting those at greatest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework in occupational health and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behaviour and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes to work policies or procedures that require action by the employer or employee.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed appropriately (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, checked frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to contaminate.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommending that workers stay home if sick, respiratory hygiene standards including covering when coughing and sneezing, provision of paper towels and waste containers, preparation for teleworking or shift shifting if necessary, discouraging workers from using tools and equipment from others, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a key measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or lower fever; that sick leave policies are flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have contracted SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission around the location of the business, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with high concentrations of people, and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and the high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers, and placing a window for the care service so that the customer can order from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the high-risk groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing frequent washing shifts, suspending travel that does not limit people's ability to conduct themselves with COVID-19, developing emergency plans that provide workers with access to safe and hygienic workplaces, providing training on how to use protective equipment, and other measures that are necessary to prevent or minimize exposure to COVID-19, including providing workers with access to safe and hygienic workplaces, providing workers with access to safe and secure work equipment, and providing a forum for workers to discuss how to use protective equipment and other tools that are essential to prevent or prevent the risk of COVID-19 exposure.
Workers in this risk group should rarely wear respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with paper towels when they cough or sneeze.
Cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to attend to a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a hazardous biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.In the case of commercial shipping, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing travel for illness, self-isolation and immediately reporting to the onboard medical centre if anyone develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical education or choir classes or dining meals, increasing desk space, staggering entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate space for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extending the cancellation of classes may be considered.For police force personnel who conduct routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
It is recommended that police officers who must come into contact with persons who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during a restraint, workers shall clean and disinfect their work belts and equipment with a household cleaning spray or towels before re-use and follow standard operating procedure for containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and morgue workers to be in high or very high risk exposure categories.
High-risk exposures include those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures on patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures are intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue jobs include those where workers are involved in preparing the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; these become very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for those risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, even when they are given aerosol-generating procedures.
Specialised ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some healthcare settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms depending on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with NIOSH-approved or higher filter mask should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory program that includes adjustment testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend the use of protective masks, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for incoming patient classification personnel.
For those who take respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, provide care for them or transport them without performing aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, eyeglasses or facial protector, robe and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use it, replacing it with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the permit to enter a COVID-19 patient's room to those involved in their direct care only, using the same mask without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

This month, we find ourselves in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have for each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we've seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we're lucky enough to work with are.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud that you are all my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether it's keeping the sites running, helping our peers get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, starting this next week, we're going to make some major adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and our schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we're facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
More to the point, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday; if you can work a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, go shopping or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, you don't have to work.
Although it shouldn't have to be said, we do.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you get a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, notify Bryan, T&C Operations, so T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work by the hour will get full pay.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and fellow hourly staff.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we're asking you to do is to contact your manager so we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The Sites Reliability Engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, are performing critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and modify our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all concentrate on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We're not planning to "double the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and we will work to set new targets and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and caring for loved ones while we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning burdens and pressure across the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will communicate the next steps to the delegates and the teams as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleanliness of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precaution, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, plus the reception and the elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our D.C. office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in the D.C. offices.
As of last week, our D.C. office moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City may know, we've also discussed renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely before know that this mode requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the length of meetings to one or two hour intervals at most.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over the course of several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video as the default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Appoint a leader to moderate each meeting, a person to monitor the chat questions and speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to tech support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the welfare reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your peers about distributed work
The HR R.H. Operations team is analysing web-based ergonomics guidelines to support increased work spread across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editing events, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We inform you that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for you to carry out your part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
We will follow up with additional guidelines next week at Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the global community seems to be, in part, sadness at the interruption and, in part, relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch on COVID-19 matters
We'll send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 PM, Coordinated Universal Time/07:00 PM, Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently being affected to a large extent.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage issues or anything else you might need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and act as liaison when needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, please email Bryan Judan, director of global operations for RR HH.
None of these changes should be considered as abandoning our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations are likely to have to adapt in a way that has not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the support it needs and give the world the service it trusts.
Our planned work will still be there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that is to come in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need all of you to make this possible, and so we need you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can find yourselves in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually referred to as hECA2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other types of cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a renal transporter domain of colectrin amino acids.
ECA2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with its enzyme-active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, venous arterial and endothelial cells and smooth muscle arterial cells in most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counteract the ECA.
ECA cleavages the hormone angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 cleaved the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also cleave several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to endosomes within cells.
This entry process also requires preparation of the S protein by the host TMPRSS2 serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitor therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that 'the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls'.
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at increased risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as robust for the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The mean lifetime of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus the effect duration of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical REN-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAIS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to assist with contact tracing in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It's already in use in over 200 Chinese cities.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the contact tracking app was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for deployment in the coming weeks. A similar app is planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore's BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperiometry app for patients living in Moscow who have received a COVID-19 diagnosis, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if application adoption is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
The organisations set eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related targets;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in law;
protections against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be established;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used, rather than apps, which eliminated both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, it is not necessary that all systems with central servers have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to carry out contact tracing.
Instead of using a specific app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate text message alerts for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, which is allowed due to sweeping changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites.Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a large amount of published research dating back to at least 2013.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort containing both centralised and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol.Decentralised protocols include decentralised proximity tracking for preserving privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, the personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protecting techniques by collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report "Out of Control Apps: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matching protocols formed the Global CNT Coalition with the goal of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect to achieve widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the code for the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementing tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the issues of adoption and persistent surveillance by first distributing the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperflation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest which they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for clinical trial design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24.[citation needed] On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent use authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the USA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are underway.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir, while the other half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would resort to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. Criticism has emerged in the scientific community over the allocation of resources to the re-adaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses, and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more severe disease and transmission.
Some initial pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two run by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are underway for hospitalized people severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a phase II trial is underway and will enroll 200 serious hospitalized patients in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several blood thinners are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the re-adaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Here are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocking IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
The following
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five potential vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the CEPI initiative requirements for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The following were among the main platform targets that passed the phase I safety studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be in planning or development).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease, while controlling for adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in 'preclinical' investigation).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential for a molecular-bound vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human trials to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in treatment with neoantigens against cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were beginning trials.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested on humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases and that, although it is progressing rapidly, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human trials are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine", which the German Government complained about.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The potential mRNA-based vaccine BNT162 is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human trials of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The potential vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the initiatives of Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced tests of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent antigen-specific antibody responses (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate within the human bacterium and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities pooled resources to access IBM's supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have nonspecific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressing ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlight the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat GASD was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one SROM (DNA-based) vaccine completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorgan failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered.The virus is spread mainly between people during close contact, usually by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced by exhalation, they usually fall to the floor or to surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.The standard method for diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
We recommend the use of masks for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks for the general public vary, with some authorities recommending that they not be used, others recommending that they be used, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish face or lips.
Symptoms in the upper airway, such as sneezing, runny nose and sore throat, are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is unknown at this time and is being studied.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 percent of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking aloud releases more droplets than speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when you cough can cause the droplets to travel 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolation of respiratory secretions and consequently airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread is possible before symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person usually infects two or three more.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on products with 99 percent copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly, as soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of the trial.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, as it bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was identified in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, which is more common in severe illness.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by respiratory ECA2-expressing epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretory T-lymphocytes were observed to be correlated with IL-6 secretory monocyte recruitment and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In autopsies, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on samples of the airways obtained by nasopharyngeal swab; however, samples of nasal swabs or sputum may also be used.
Usually, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples must be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
The experience in China with testing has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular glazed glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered pedimental pattern (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
The following conditions are observed:
There are four types of severity of viral pneumonia:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and giant cell formation with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukocyte-erythroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when you cough or sneeze, and if you don't have handkerchiefs, use the inside of your elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDC has recommended the use of cloth caps in public places, one reason being to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also state that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, at the earliest, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
They also recommend using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when water and soap are not available in a timely manner.For areas where hand sanitizers are not easily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antiseptic".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are provided with supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that anyone suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EMOC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments may be helpful for those with mild symptoms in the early stage of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care and pulmonologists in the U.S. compiled recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend parecetamol (acetaminophen), instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when procedures that can generate aerosols are performed, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an airborne infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to avoid airborne transmission.
Recommended equipment is PPE jacket, mask, protective eyewear and medical gloves.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but there is no guarantee of effectiveness against a specific biological agent not specified in the product information.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for hospitalized people with respiratory failure related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per person in hospitals, limiting the health system's ability to handle the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 percent were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, approximately 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually transfer to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Respirators with different pressure control and PPTE modes are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of respirator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested on people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted a temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for any disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect 'close contact' and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also alerts local health officials. Macro data analysis of cell phone information, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summarized location data of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile operators have informed him that "40 percent of people are still moving".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42 000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distress about quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may progress slightly with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection by the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but data from COVID-19 are insufficient.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to water-difficulty respiratory syndrome (WSDRS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorgan failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, altered blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Alteration of clotting, specifically increased protombin time, has been reported in 6% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, while alteration of renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among males was 2.8%, and among females was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (APDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized persons had a pre-existing condition.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary because of these regional differences, but also methodological difficulties.
Insufficient mild case counts may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and imaging of the lungs suggests organ damage.
This can also cause post-convalescence intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It appears that immunity is possible, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases recovered from COVID-19 that subsequently tested positive for coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be worsening of a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and animal-derived, through interspecific infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but, by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, pointed to the first date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, various measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are affected by the volume of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate is 6.9 % (153,822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the rate of death in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the rate of death in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-dependent and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of cases.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people were infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, so there was a relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined from blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004 % of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women narrows only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 for males and 1.7 for females.
The exact reasons for this sex difference are unknown, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immunological differences, fewer women smoking, and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as high blood pressure, at a younger age may have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track sex information in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations on naming to prevent stigmatization.
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local start-up reverse engineered and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly through the Internet.
It seems humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Governmental organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing potential vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus enter the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based enhancement is a potential challenge to the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adapted antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, including nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in various countries and due to report by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and potential drugs against COVID-19 was underway. Several antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020.The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that doubling that dose is very dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial priming of the S protein that performs transmembrane serine-protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine release may be a complication of the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after the completion of a small study.
It is in a non-randomized phase II national trial in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, it will counteract these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death in some infected persons.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of other-cause steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome, T-CAR T lymphocyte treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for SRC.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
