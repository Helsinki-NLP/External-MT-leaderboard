The number of Ukrainian recruits preparing to go to Donbass
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, Kiev is planning to "at least somehow supplement the units".
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to low staffing of units", - said Marochko, quoted by "RIA Novosti".
He also did not rule out that the actual numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later changed to the operation of the United Forces (OF).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to the strengthening of the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of DPR head Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities have described the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian special services.
The US authorities forced Musk to step down as Tesla's chairman.
American businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla, a company he founded, at the request of U.S. authorities.
The company will also pay $20 million to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to remain at the top of Tesla.
He must pay $20 million and step down as chairman of the board within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It's been clarified that the settlement still needs to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Musk of misleading shareholders by claiming that he had sufficient funds to buy back the company's shares and sued the entrepreneur.
It's about a businessman's Twitter post where he said he wanted to buy Tesla shares at $420 a share, but never did.
After the tweet, the company's stock went up almost 11%.
The British Foreign Secretary compared the EU to the Soviet Union and a prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of holding member states captive.
The diplomat made the statement at the ruling Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
Hunt was commenting on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process, as reported by the Daily Mail.
What happened to belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union would not let anyone leave.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave will not diminish but only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape", the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had stalled.
This is how she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The UK's exit is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on the issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the EU.
The Irish border is also an open question.
South Korean president gets two dogs for mushrooms from North Korea
South Korean President Moon Jae-in received two puppies as a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after visiting Pyongyang.
Reuters reports this with reference to a representative of the South Korean president's administration.
"A pair of Phunsan dogs were presented as a gift at the summit.
On Thursday, they were received", - said in the department.
The dogs, about a year old, were given several kilograms of food by the North Korean side "as an aid to their adaptation".
The gift was made in honor of the inter-Korean summit, which was held from September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.
The hunting breed is the Phunsan, named after a district in North Korea.
Moon is an animal lover and has two dogs that were given to him by former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also gave his colleague two tons of delicious matsutakae mushrooms.
He ordered these mushrooms to be given to families separated during the Korean War who had not yet reunited with their relatives in the DPRK.
Altai village council leader ends hunger strike to protect residents
The MP announced on his Facebook page that he had stopped the hunger strike for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation was deadlocked, the district administration did not respond to his demands, and he needed to do his job.
In addition, the prosecutor's office began to check the situation, and the heat supply organization of the STPK promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Sibirsky village next week.
Also, the villagers made and took to the governor of the Altai Territory a mass collective appeal, "concerning the catastrophic situation".
Boronin himself reported that he felt normal, he had performed his duties as head of the hunger strike in full measure.
As Boronin explained, the villages of Sibirsky and Rogulichny have centralized systems of heat supply, which means that the powers to prepare them for winter should be performed by the administration of the First May district.
But no one has yet started to do so.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai Territory and against the financial policy of the company "Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk".
In addition to preparing the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded "immediately to organize a fully independent community farm with the appropriate staff units".
Moscow 's newest apartment buildings with the cheapest prices
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand units of housing with an area of 30 square meters and a value of up to four million rubles were purchased in new buildings in Moscow.
More than half of these transactions were made with two housing companies, according to the Urbanus portal (available on "Lenti.ru").
The leaders in terms of sales of housing in the budget up to four million rubles were the "Nekrasovka" housing complex, located behind the MKAD, in the Koelniki district (Southwest Asian Development Agency), and the apartment complex "Barbaris" in the Bibierevo district (SVAO).
Two housing estates in New Moscow - "Southern Bunino" and "Kale Alley" - were also notable in the structure of deals with budget housing.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of deals with apartments up to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 percent of all sales and provides half of the total revenue.
"The impact of apartments with a budget of less than four million rubles on the commercial success of the Central neighborhood in the New Watutinka and the Filatov Lug housing complex should be recognized", the study says about two other housing communities in New Moscow.
They account for about 35 percent of the total financial revenues.
Earlier, the rating of Moscow's districts with the cheapest apartments in new buildings was presented by the real estate agency "Bon Ton".
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149,9 thousand rubles per meter) in September 2018 were recorded in South Georgia.
In second and third place were WАО and SVAO with 184,1 and 192,8 thousand rubles respectively.

Telegram users complained about a glitch in the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with Telegram's messaging service after the update, which was released on September 28.
You can get a user 's phone number from their username .
The complaints concern devices running the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, the app shows a white screen or closes immediately after the update.
The messenger responded to the failure.
They say the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic updates until the bugs are fixed.
On April 13, the Tagan court in Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's lawsuit against the blocking of Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the telecom operators began enforcing the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user when a court order was issued.
Telegram audience shrinks by 1.2 million

We knew that Dynamo had a good win before our meeting, so we prepared very seriously.
It was important to throw in the majority, I'm glad for the guys who came out to realize the numerical advantage.

We knew Minsk would come out strong, try hard, and it did.
The game was mostly decisive, the winning goal was scored in the uneven squads.

Elon Musk has been forced to step down as Tesla's chairman.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the network, Musk will have to step down as chairman of Tesla's board of directors.
The commission allowed Musk to keep his position as Tesla's CEO.
The company's founder will also have to pay a $20 million administrative fine.
The same amount will be charged to Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American businessman who is listed as one of the 50 richest people on the planet by Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space corporation SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink and the developer of the Tesla electric car, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over a tweet about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to take Tesla private and buy back all of its stock at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 price tag was set allegedly "due to the significance of the number in marijuana culture", Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the commission's co-director of security Steven Peakin.
However, Elon Musk later abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he considered the fraud allegations unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way", the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them a loss.
In particular, one shareholder claimed that the businessman's tweets were misleading, forcing Tesla stock sellers to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Musk's careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate.
In September, Elon Musk was accused of stock market fraud by the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk failed to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he could face suspension from the company's board and even jail.
This was stated by former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt to CNBC.
Musk is "a good guy who can't run a car company".

The ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC to the actions of fascists
The head of the Moscow Patriarchate's Department of External Church Relations (OCCR) Metropolitan Ilarion of Volokolamsk compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church into the Russian Church in Ukraine to the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolam - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible church split and its political undertones
He said that now, when "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage", renaming the church is like "pinning a yellow six-pointed star on the Jews" in Nazi Germany.
"It means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and that is why this bill was created", a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church told the "Russia 24" television channel.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country".
The UOC called on the Constantinople Exarchs to leave their territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: anshlag, Russian bolide and return of Kvyat
Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was stated by Russian Vice-Premier Dmitry Kozak, summing up the meeting with Russian car manufacturers on the eve of the start of the Grand Prix of Russia in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared his opinion on the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso and evaluated the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with the car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of a Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to stimulate our car manufacturers in this direction.
We were talking about plans until 2024, but I don't think that's possible at this time.
I think the more realistic time frame is within the next ten years".
From 2012 to 2014, the team "Marusia" competed in Formula 1 under a Russian license.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors willing to invest in the creation of a national team in the world championship of auto racing in the class "Formula-1".
I know that there are car sports enthusiasts in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team", he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came about because Sochi has such an infrastructure".
Tomorrow, the Sochi Autodrome is going to be under attack.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even at qualifying, the stands were almost full, "said the vice-premier.
I can tell you that revenue this year is up 72% from last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak did not ignore the main topic of the day for Russian fans of motorsport - the return of Daniel Kvyat to "Toro Rosso".
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, - said the Deputy Prime Minister to "Izvesti".
He's a very promising driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to participate in the peloton of Formula 1.
Although the further fate of Sergei Sirtkin in the "Royal races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams expires at the end of the season, and his results are not yet impressive: he took 18th place in the qualifying round of the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

Basta has embarrassed the fans of Rostov
Russian musician Vasily Vakulenko, who performs under the pseudonym Basta, addressed fans of the Rostov football club during his concert in the local arena.
His words are reported by Rostovgazeta.ru.
Why are we so hypocritical and only celebrate success?
Where were you all when the club was in such a bad shape?
It was only when things got better that everyone thought of the great club again.
But let's talk about other football teams in Rostov", Basta said.
The musician's concert was held on September 29.
On the same day, evidence emerged that the field of the "Rostov-Arena" was damaged due to the protective cover that was installed before the rapper's performance.
The football club "Rostov", as well as the leadership of the Russian Premier League (RPL) have reacted negatively to the holding of a musical concert at the Rostov stadium.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced his unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin ushered in the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame, and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the extraction of penicillin from mold was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, he had a cold and sowed mucus from his own nose on a Petri dish - a glass lid used for testing bacteria - and found that the bacteria had been destroyed a few days later.
And penicillin was discovered by almost the same accident.
Fleming's name was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding people in human history.
His discovery, many scientists say, changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases that had been considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene.
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers reported: "He has done more than a dozen divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France".
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in London's famous St. Paul's Cathedral.
By the way, my wife and I were noticed by a very chatty Russian-speaking tour guide.
And then a few years later, we saw a full-grown statue of Alexander Fleming in the most unexpected place in the Spanish capital.
There, near the main arena for the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man whose efforts, in their opinion, saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighting masters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, is a very interesting porcelain piece that I found in Madrid, but at a different time and not for this reason at all.

Trump spoke of his "in love" with Kim Jong Un
The US and North Korean leaders have almost fallen in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump has made a good joke about his successes in the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of annihilation, the two leaders have now straightened their relationship to the point of almost falling in love, the US president said.
The White House host recalled that he had taken the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump said that Barack Obama's team had so developed relations with North Korea that they couldn't even reach the country's leadership - they just wouldn't pick up.
The U.S. and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing the White House "beautiful letters", Trump said.
Trump admitted that he was "tough" on Kim Jong-un at the beginning of his tenure, which was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved to the point where the leaders have "fallen in love".
Trump asked that his words not be taken literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and is closing military testing grounds.
All this is thanks to the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke highly of Kim Jong-un from the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps to de-escalate tensions.
Trump said the sanctions against North Korea would remain in place until the Korean Peninsula was fully denuclearized.
The negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore.

The positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
However, other practical steps toward denuclearization of North Korea are still in the pipeline.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the US had sent several disarmament scenarios to North Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them as "gangster".

Niçoy called for "Ukrainian product to displace Moscow language"
Ukrainian children's writer and mother tongue champion Larisa Nizoy called for the "Russian-language product and the Moscow language" to be pushed out of Ukraine.
She suggests doing so with a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught".
Niçoy shared her thoughts on the "purpose of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Ozrevatel".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even exists and continues to develop further.
She believes that Ukrainians will eventually "recover" from this "Moscow language".
For example, in neighboring Poland, she says, Russian was widely used on television and radio, but it has almost disappeared from public space.
At the same time, according to Nizoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities, which prohibit the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "an expansion of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Previously, Nice shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, where a cashier was speaking Russian to her.
When she failed, Nicey threw a change at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nicey said that the name "Russ" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moskovia.
The writer's anger could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the employees talking to each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.
We had a man-to-man conversation in the break, and it paid off.
Defender of the Ural Denis Kulakov - about the victory over Arsenal (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.

"I think we wanted to win more", - quotes Kulakov official website "Ural".
"It was a difficult game, and we had a serious conversation in the break, and it paid off: we scored two goals and didn't miss.
"You missed a couple of games because of an injury you got earlier this month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you can hold out for 90 minutes, you're good!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end, save some energy so nothing happens.
And so, Dr. and Physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyovich Gashnev led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"How about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret that after victories, it's easier to recover and the mood is good.
Now we have a white stripe, but it was black before.
We need to keep it up and keep the fans happy".
"Missed the game while you were out?"
"There is such a thing, a little missed, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But once again, thank you to the physical therapist and the doctors for getting me back on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and we made the fans happy.
And everything else is secondary".

The prosecution is news to the Dagestan MP
The Mahachkala Soviet District Court has sentenced to two months in prison a member of the People's Assembly of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, suspected of being a member of a criminal group that issued disability for bribes.
"Ъ" has become aware of details of the investigation materials shedding light on how, according to the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramazan Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipov contributed to the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Examination Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the operational-search activities conducted by the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev as the head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
Recall that earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other leaders and employees of the territorial bureaus of medical and social examination, which are under his subordination, was initiated a criminal case under article 210 (creation of a criminal community using the service position and participation in it), article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (service counterfeiting) and article 159 (fraud in a particularly large size) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the investigation materials, in late 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in theft of Pension Fund funds, joined their activities, joining the criminal community.
Being the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service's Department for Dagestan and having connections in the state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as using his kinship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his being in the position of head of the federal treasury institution "The Main Bureau of Medical and Social Examination for the Republic of Dagestan", organized the illegal establishment of disabilities for citizens".
After the information was announced at the session of the Soviet district court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being brought against me today is new to me, completely unfamiliar", he said.
The court arrested the deputy from "United Russia" not ten days before the indictment, as it was with the previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but immediately for two months, because his case is listed in Article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigation has a much longer time to bring charges - up to 45 days from the time of arrest.

The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it could be a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have become almost accustomed to in recent years in relation to Russia has now been much more muted", the senator said in an interview published Sunday in the "Rossiyskaya Gazeta".
He explained that in previous years Russia was sometimes "marked as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this category, at least in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which was quite unanimous on this matter".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia in a negative sense was almost absent".
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the president of the United States, the president of France, the speech of the German foreign minister, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least the chorus was not quite accurate", the politician noted, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall that is trained with tennis balls".
The head of the Federation Council's relevant committee does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will be the highlight of the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, two, three".
"I do not exclude that this session in some sense may be a turning point", Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's involvement can move forward in international affairs".
He gave examples of the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, it is not Ukraine yet, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", the MP added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time".
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we are at a point where moving forward is not going backwards", he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, nobody was interested, then now the situation is different", - said the Chairman of the Committee of the Council of Federation.
He believes this is because "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified by the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, the shortage of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration".
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious", Kosachev said, stressing that he considers the current session "successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".
Orotkin finished last at the Russian Grand Prix of Formula One.
That's a great result for Max.
Considering he started 19th!
That's the birthday.
The Dutchman is upset, though.
We're going to congratulate Hamilton.
His lead over Vettel has increased by 50 points.
Bottas in the background is probably looking on with indignation.
Damascus has declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that it will not have to use military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said.
He said Syria had a right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawing the militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports "RIA Novosti".
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, Muallem said the talks with the Kurdish SDF were good until they were interrupted by the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact of the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.
Terry has taken over the youth team at Chelsea.
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating a move to Moscow's "Spartacus".
As reported by RT with reference to the Mirror, former England captain John Terry has taken over the youth team of Chelsea.
According to the source, the famous player, who has been a part of the London club for a long time, will be in charge of the team at the age of 23.
It is noted that Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Derby County.
In September, Terry was close to moving to Moscow's Spartacus, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerachenko, apologized to Russian journalist Roman Sushchenko, who has been convicted of "espionage" in Russia, for not being released from prison.
She said this in a video address to the political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Sushchenko's illegal arrest by the FSB.
According to her, a hunger strike is being held outside the Russian Embassy in Paris, demanding the release of Kremlin prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, go on hunger strike in support of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", - said Gerashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that the trials would harden each Ukrainian, making us "more evil, tougher in defending Ukraine's national interests, in defending each Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
Recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Russian Supreme Court recognized this verdict as legal.
The Russian prison guards have granted the Ukrainian's last request before he is sent to a colony.
NASA reports an asteroid the size of Big Ben is approaching Earth .
The US space agency NASA has reported that a large asteroid, SP1, may be approaching Earth.
According to the Daily Express, the object could be taller than the famous Big Ben or the London Ferris wheel.
But we don't have any exact figures yet.
The speed of SP1 is about 60,000 km/h. The shortest distance between the asteroid and Earth will be October 3.
It will then pass by our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million kilometers.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19.
NASA has classified it as a near-Earth object.
Earlier, on September 27, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency released the first ever video from the surface of the asteroid Ryugu.
Two Japanese rovers (planet-walkers) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe managed to get unique images.

The concert, scheduled for September 29, was not canceled.
The Rostov Football Club and the Russian Premier League opposed the concert.
"I want to know the names of those players and representatives of Rostov who claim that my performance may harm, hinder the activities and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players", Basta wrote in response to the criticism.
"Rostov-Arena" is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.
It hosted five matches of the tournament.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Watching Kikabiadze talk about his fight against cancer
Now, many artists talk about how they've managed to cope with cancer.
Unfortunately, the disease is a scourge, and the stories of popular cancer survivors give hope to many.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he was alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible disease that sounded like a death sentence.
"I feel like I've been hit in the head with a hammer.
I fell.
I lost my bearings.
We put him in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
They started running tests, and it was bad, the artery's not getting through.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a large pustular cyst in my head, they operated on me urgently.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", Kikabiadze told the program "Once".
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on his doorstep.
But the actor's wife did not allow him to be buried alive, she believed that she could cope with the disease and for more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved husband.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a crisis, she was there for me like a rock", the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he refutes rumors of his illness, of his untimely death, which occasionally appear on the Internet.
The creators of the site "Peacemaker" have added the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Sijartó to the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was "attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the foreign ministry of the neighboring country was found guilty of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participating "in the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens".
It should be noted that before Siyyarto in the "Purification" pleased the deputy of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow patriarchate) Onufry.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of the Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issue of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Transcarpathia, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Voreneg deputy governor
The payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On public positions".
The actual amount of the "golden parachute" of the former official was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
The regional government's press service has been given such an explanation.
According to the law, the salary of Agibalov is 11 189 rubles.
Thus, the press service stressed that the amount of the one-time payment was 223 892 rubles, minus income tax, and not 1 million rubles, which was reported by the media.
The official was receiving an old age pension from July 2018.
His tenure in public office is over nine years.
The appointment of this pension and the one-time payment is made immediately after dismissal from office, the regional government explained to RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the payment of Agibalov's pension was suspended when he was appointed to a state post, and the size of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
The winner of the election of the governor of the region, acting governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was relieved of his duties due to the expiration of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region ended.
On September 29, the Telegram-channel "Nezygary" published documents showing that Agibalov, who had resigned from the post of vice governor, was paid a severance allowance of 23 salary, and two days later he again received a similar position without the prefix "vrio".
State Duma deputy urges schoolchildren to learn about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his experience, he said in an interview that teenagers are being tempted to masturbate by the harmful information they find on the Internet.
The MP added that the fight against this should be at the level of educational institutions and families.
Gennady Onichenko, a deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow says":
In the context of general sex education, this should be done by explaining the harm, because there is a definite risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it's that puberty comes early enough, and then there's a big gap between puberty and the opportunity to formally engage in intersex relationships.
According to Onishchenko, the problem is hampered by "spoofing", the silence of "sex problems" and the lack of culture of adequate child rearing.
The doctor is sure that masturbation is a common problem among teenagers.
The deputy believes that the lessons on the harm of onanism should be taught in schools in "hyperurbanised" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, you and I will not be understood, to put it mildly", the professor said.
Onishchenko is a current academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a doctor of medical sciences, a professor.
Honored physician of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the presidium of the all-Russian public organization "League of health of the nation".

The A.D.G. is the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is breaking another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that the German people have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policies, which have made the country a coveted destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest opinion polls show that the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is gaining popularity and that the positions of Merkel and Seehofer's ruling bloc are weakening.
This week, the ADG broke another record, rising to second place in the popularity ranking.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the popularity, managed to overtake the social democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one-percent gap can be attributed to statistical errors, but it is also worth noting that the ADG, which was founded in 2013 by a small group of eurosceptic economists, has grown into a major political force.
The leadership in the general election is still held by the ruling bloc of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a trend towards a loss of points - back in April, the support of Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who is heading the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also falling.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, down 7 percent from last year.
The Social Democrats are followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The evolution of the Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's policy, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU cooperation.
The group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of the weak EU economies, and did not rule out a return to the German mark and a complete exit of the country from the European Union.
The political platform of the AfD has expanded amid the deepening immigration crisis.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party that took on a niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for its failed immigration policies.
At the last parliamentary election in 2017, the AfD managed to make its way into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternative for Germany won seats in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist calling Ukrainians a "nation of fools" has been published
Ukrainian TV political talk show host, author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted in a live broadcast that he considers his compatriots a "nation of fools".
They trust the TV and read little.
As Drzdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We are not taught to read and accept texts from childhood", said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the Independent's State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting has begun to fight literature that contains the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 editions.

Canadians have created a car for the apocalypse - Drive magazine
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is accepting orders for its new armored vehicle.
The Roshel Senator APC is the apocalypse armored vehicle.
The apocalypse is not just a business for video game, movie, and book publishers.
Now the automobile industry is also opening up a new niche.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions has unveiled its apocalyptic Senator APC armored personnel carrier.
In their spare time, the company's engineers build armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed to carry 12 passengers, who are not particularly comfortable but are placed in complete safety in a welded armored capsule.
This bunker, or design you can not call, because its level of reservation meets the standard of B7, installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from bombing and anti-personnel mines.
The saloon of the apocalypse armored car Roshel Senator APC
To prevent the passengers from being injured by the blast wave from the shell that exploded near the car, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock absorbing seats.
The capsule also has an autonomous ventilation and fire suppression system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a system of circular view cameras with night vision, as well as an armored observation tower on the roof.
There's no weapon in the car.
Front of the Roshel Senator APC apocalypse armored personnel carrier
To ensure that the weight of the armored vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower turbodiesel engine with a volume of 6.7 liters, all of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored vehicle via a 6-speed automatic transmission.

The Roshel Senator APC apocalyptic armored personnel carrier will be on display at a special exhibition in Washington in October.
It's called the death of the universe.
The universe will last for about 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observable world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The research by an international team of scientists is available on the arXiv.org preprint library and is to be published in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
The researchers came to this conclusion by observing about ten million galaxies with the help of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) telescope.
Tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, scientists working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter) estimated the expansion rate of the universe to be slightly slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations have allowed a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data recording by the European Planck Space Telescope has clarified the limitations imposed on the ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible end of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observable world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the pension referendum failed
The public 's opinion on pension reform is being postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the all-federal initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, who registered different formulas of questions (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulas).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians a question: "Are you for the fact that the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, when Russian citizens reach the age at which they receive the right to receive an old-age pension, should not be increased?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally most capable.
Most of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Justice Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told "Vedomosti" that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and the representatives of about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her formulation was supported by 15 other subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy".
Blues singer Otis Rush has died.

The Admiral has given us a lot of trouble.
Zinetula Bilyaltdinov: "Admiral" has created a lot of problems for us
The head coach of "Aq Barsa" Zinatula Bilyaltdinov summed up the results of the regular championship match of the KHL against "Admiral" (4:2).
"It was a difficult game, a difficult one.
The enemy fought well, and they gave us a lot of trouble.
I'm glad we played well today for the most part.
I told you, the goals are coming, as long as we work on it.
And that we won is also very important".
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this particular series?"
"We have our own program that he's working on.
That's why we made this decision", - says Bilyaltdinov.

The businessman will retain his position as chief executive officer, the regulator said.

In the match between "Loko" and "Ahmat" Turbin's mistakes were pouring out like a pot of gold.
Former all-Union category judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Yevgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmats" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the refereeing of Eugene Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness to referee matches of the Russian Premier League.
I'm surprised that in the fifth round of the match between Spartacus and Dynamo neither Turbin nor the DSI leaders came to any serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private misses of rude receptions poured out like a horn of plenty.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder is overwhelmed with his hands in his penalty area by the defender of "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
It's eight yards from the goal, but Turbine's not scoring.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idow, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed the ball hit his hand?
- I believe there was deliberate play by the defender's arm in his penalty area.
Turbin was close to the moment, and he can see the scene and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was supposed to be seen by reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and no penalty was imposed.
So the score is skewed and the game is a travesty.
This was the case where refereeing by concepts supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krychovyk, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second mustard?
- Turbin's first yellow card was a little off.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams get penalties for such violations, like in the episode with Idova, and some do not.
What do you think of the footballer's words?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't.
So the referee doesn't give a second penalty in the opposing goal.
Here's the principle that's used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee looks at who's playing.
"Lokomotiv" played on Saturday and "Ahmat" has serious complaints about Turbin's work because the team was wronged.
Matt Damon played the accused rapist Judge Kavanaugh at the SNL premiere.
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate rape hearing.
The US Supreme Court nominee had previously attracted attention for his emotional and detailed remarks during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly admitted to his love of beer, but has stated that he never drank himself into a stupor.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the rape charge, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin during those years.
Damon beat those moments, too.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows that", said Matt Damon, the judge.
Kavanaugh was previously elected as the U.S. Supreme Court justice.
Barbra Streisand has discovered a strange behavior in her cloned dogs .
American singer Barbra Streisand has said that clones of her dead dog behave very differently from their original pet.
"They're not alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but you can't clone a soul", the 76-year-old singer said.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cotton-de-tulear dog Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Chihuahua, nicknamed Miracle Milly, the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Scientists are cloning a six-year-old animal to try to understand why it is so tiny.
The United States is considering a sea blockade of Russia over oil and gas supplies .
The United States may embark on a naval blockade of Russia to gain an edge in the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so eager to succeed in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
The possibility of a naval blockade was raised by US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police but civilian functions, including policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement was entirely within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the U.S. Navy controls the sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinka suggested that the need may be due to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives a large share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinka is sure.
The minister made clear that the United States still hopes to secure leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington would have to push Russia and Iran out, and a sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinké said.
The director of the festival got good reviews
Our compatriot, the actor of the "Gogol-center" Evgeny Sangadjiev and his film "Harmony" ("Harmony") were honored with a special mention by the jury members of the sixth "Movement" debut festival, which took place in Omsk.
The festival's nameplate states that "this is a signal for immediate response of the major industrial players of the audience cinema".
As you know, the picture of the young Kalmyk director was presented in the short film program "Movement. Beginning", where eight films participated.
The main prize in this competition program was won by the picture "Yana - it's Aña in reverse" - the directorial debut of actress Yana Gladki.
The focus of the National Debut Film Festival "Movement" is on young cinema, but not in terms of the age of the directors, but on their state of mind, willingness and ability to take risks.
And the graduate of the Elista School of Arts named after P. Chonkushov and RATI-GITIS, Yevgeny Sangadjiev, meets all these requirements.
He's young, talented, creative, and he's looking for new, non-standard forms of expression in his work.

Supersonic passenger aircraft to be delivered in Russia
The mass production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the General Director of the Central Aerodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky Kirill Sypala.
According to him, the scientific center conducts work on supersonic subjects both within the framework of international consortia and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"We feel it will take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, and another 10-15 years to get a production car that can transport across the vastness of our homeland", Sypala added.
He said that now the Russian specialists are faced with the question of how to make the equipment economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the developer of aviation equipment PJSC "Tupolev" announced the completion of pre-project work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to develop a speed of up to 1900 km / h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the deputy general director of the enterprise Valery Solozobov.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He told CNN.
He said he could only confirm the Washington Post columnist's claim that the result of Putin's aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.
"In 2013, 16% of Ukrainians supported transatlantic integration of Ukraine, NATO membership.
Now it's more than 54%.
Who did this?
I'm not going to.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine, the accession to the EU supported 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74 percent now.
Who did this?
Putin", said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire", - stressed the President of Ukraine.
As FACTS wrote, in late September 2018, President Petro Poroshenko was in the United States and took part in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of Ukraine's great friend, US Senator (1987-2018) John McCain.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia Race
There's a club in Russia I'm following.
Former captain of Chelsea and England John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartacus" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I follow.
I've been watching him for a while now, and I was curious to see him from the side.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for my decision", Terry said.
Recall that "Rostov" with 18 points moved up to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartacus" is in fifth place, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white will play against "Yenisei" on October 7, and the under guardians of Valery Karpin a day earlier will take "Orenburg".
The expensive violin was sold to a pawnshop for a pittance .
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop employee offered only $50 for the apparently old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and he sought expert advice.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinand Galliano and is valued at $250,000.
The violin strings alone are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the town and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It's unclear how the violin ended up in the hands of the man who sold it to the pawnshop, but he has no prior history of run-ins with the law.
The manager says that now anyone bringing a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we will face a thrilling confrontation: "Spartacus" will host "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as is known, not at all alien to the "people's team".
The clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each - and they share the 3rd and 4th places in the tournament table, being behind far-scoring Zenit and one point behind Krasnodar, which plays Dinamo tomorrow.
The red and white have a difficult time: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly lost to Rapida, and recently lost to the home team of Akhmat.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartacus" with a minimum score and not without difficulty defeated in the Cup "Black Sea", and it is still too early to say whether the most popular club of Russia is close to the exit from the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three matches in a row, but it has not lost five matches.
Let's see if Carpin can extend his winless streak with a game as important as this.
The previous meeting between Karp's "Rostov" and "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia hit by tsunami after devastating tsunami
In Indonesia, where a few days ago an earthquake triggered a 10-foot-high tsunami, meteorologists are observing more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting Sulawesi island, reports the TV channel "Russia 24".
The death toll exceeded 420 and more than 500 were injured.
The authorities warned the population of the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled it.

London is bursting at the seams with accusations against Moscow .
Russia is trying to rewrite the Cold War, UK Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.
But England will defend its values, he said in a speech at the ruling Conservative Party congress in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies are operating in gray areas with cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest of these is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Russia would pay a heavy price if it did not abide by international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in Salisbury, England, in March of this year of former GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to changing the country's name.
The referendum is designed to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of a neighboring Greek province.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a vocal supporter of renaming the republic North Macedonia, was among the first to vote.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the observers' work was organized:
About 100 teams have been deployed across the country to monitor the entire process from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.
For a month, our 10 teams worked in the country to monitor the preparation of the vote, the work of the media, the compliance with the law on campaign finance and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulghery: "About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the vote.
The monitoring groups record the details and communicate with the election commissioners to then present them in a final report".
Translator compares Russian and German mentality
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in mutual understanding.
This was reported by professional translator-synchronist Barbel Saxe on the International Translator's Day, September 30.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"Germans like to plan things quietly, but Russians, as the saying goes, "pull over and drive fast".
But I think it is not important for the understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator", the expert told RIA Novosti.
To understand that the two countries cannot do without each other, the translator says, "it is enough to know history".
And in the future, Sachse said, Germany has no reason to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny", she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to "build relations" with Russia and support them.
According to her, the project of the gas pipeline "Northern Stream-2", which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin's mania.

Vladimir Putin has released Alexander Manjosin from his position as head of the president's foreign policy office.
Igor Neverov is appointed to this post.
Mr. Manjosian has been the head of the President's Office of Foreign Policy since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure, a source close to the Kremlin, "Ъ", cited personal circumstances, noting that there were no significant complaints about the quality of work to the head of the department.
Igor Neverov previously headed the Second European Department of the Foreign Ministry.
In 2009-2014, he was the Russian ambassador to Sweden.
Russians donated one ruble to a low-wage MP
In Ekaterinburg, the charity "People" fund has opened a fundraiser for State Duma deputy Vera Ganzi, who complained about her low salary.
The campaign can be followed on the organisation's website.
"The Humane Society hopes that we can save the servant of the people.
We ask all people who are not indifferent to give a chance to live and a happy future!
All the proceeds will be donated to the poor personally.
God save you!" the foundation said in a statement.
The donors want to raise 380 thousand rubles for the deputy, which is equivalent to a month's salary.
Reports on the assistance received are published on the fund's Vkontakte page, where the organizers post screenshots of the money transfers.
The most common donations are one ruble and 50 cents.
At the time of publication, the Russians donated 1633 rubles to Vera Hanse.
The fundraising campaign was launched on September 28 after Ghazi complained about low income.
According to her, the average salary of a deputy is 380 thousand rubles, from which nothing remains, so you have to spend money from a credit card.
Ganja complained that the parliamentarians were not compensated for their representative expenses.
After that, the State Duma said that they would consider paying representative expenses to the deputies.
The "Golden Shrimp" of the San Sebastian Festival was awarded to "Between Two Seas".

The tape won the festival's main award - "Golden Shrove".
Norwegian actress Pia Tjelta won the Silver Shell Award for Best Actress for Blind Spot.
The best actor was named Argentine Dario Grandiennetti for the film "Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benjamin Neustadt, won best director.
The comedy "Evening School" topped the American box office.
The comedy "Evening School", which debuted in theaters last Friday, earned $28 million in its opening weekend.
This result allowed the uncomplicated film starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office for September 28-30.
The film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million worldwide, including $2 million from British audiences.
In the fight for the top spot, Malcolm Lee's work, remarkably, was quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer to the Western market - the cartoon "Smallfoot", the curious story of a charming yeti's encounter with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project by directors Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reising grossed $23 million in its opening weekend, largely fulfilling experts' expectations of $20-25 million for the weekend.
As for the total collection of "Smallfoot", it currently stands at $38.6 million (it debuted in 50 countries): the most active was Mexico, which added $3.6 million to the film's budget.
The top three this time was closed by the children's story "The Secret of the House with a Clock" by horror master Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director can make a quality film for an audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the John Bellarmine adaptation of the book starring the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett grossed $12.5 million, bringing its worldwide gross to $53.8 million.
Despite dropping out of the top 3, the "Simple Request" thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick continues to surprise with a "+" mark: in 17 days in the American box office, Paul Figg's picture, from which some unrealistic financial achievements were not initially expected from the word "absolutely", has raised $43 million (including $6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has a total revenue of $62.9 million.
The latest to make the top five this week is horror movie "The Curse of the Nun", which brought in $5.4 million in the last quarter.
The Spin-Off "The Incantation" has grossed $330 million in the US (and beyond) in its first 24 days of release and is now the most successful film in the franchise, which also includes two parts of "The Incantation" and two films about the creepy doll Annabelle.
Just behind Corinne Hardy's horror, another newcomer to the genre has emerged this weekend, debutant Hellfest, one of the top teen horror shows of the year.
In its first weekend, the offspring of noted filmmaker (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked on a number of major horror projects, including Happy Day of the Dead, to which Hellfest is very similar in places, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the film's modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
Seventh was "The Madly Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems to be in the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, which has been on the screens for seven weeks, is sixth in the ranking of the most profitable films of the genre in history with a figure of 165.7 million.
That 's how much the film has earned in the domestic market - the film 's total revenue is 218.8 million .
As for the last three lucky ones to make the top 10 in the US on September 28-30, they were Predator, White Boy Rick and...
And next weekend, the long-awaited "Venom" with Tom Hardy will be playing in the U.S. and will undoubtedly take the top spot at the box office in the first weekend of October.
Other releases this week include the Venice Film Festival winner "A Star Is Born" by Bradley Cooper and the crime drama "Your Hate".

Valery Belov: God helped "Siberia" today
Valery Belov, head coach of Vityaz, on the defeat of Siberia (3:4) in the regular championship match of the KHL.
"My colleague spoke about the fans of Siberia, and I want to mention our fans", - quotes Belov's official website "Vityaz".
"I hope they'll support it, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, God helped Siberia today, because they made a big mistake, especially our leaders.
We lost the micro-match 0-3 to our leaders, so it was difficult to get this match, although there were moments.
But I'm still gonna take the fall.
Because they must have missed something in the preparation.
It was a different team than the last one".
"This is a nasty little fraternity".
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice for the Voice.
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "depraved pimping and brazen trickery".
When he heard the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin in the blind auditions, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But his sonly feelings got the better of him, and he chose a relative on his team.
Many thought it was a joke at the time, but they forgave the coach for being unbiased in the first stage.
But the joke dragged on, and the star's father was unjustifiably replaced by a more worthy performer.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we viewers of the show were outraged by the pimp's ugly and blatant dragging of our close relatives up the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutin would have the strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end to the very first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "screwed" beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wants to see him in his father's show.
But it turns out that's not the case, the audience wants an objective evaluation and to see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"My sympathies to the Voice players on Agutin's team. They were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he had to show himself a professional".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave your father who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?"
"I like how Dad sings, so arrange a concert for him in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people come to that concert".
This is The Voice, not the Cool Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional on Agustin's part".
"Then you should offer to do your own show for Dad, not the one that Channel 1 pays for".
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me more understanding than any other contestant with real vocal data.
Why did they dump a worker from Surgut with a great voice and timbre and get Agutin's dad to the finish line?
And then we all complain that on stage and on screen, the same faces for decades!
Because you can't get through the best man!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
It's all about the mud and the cronyism.
And the money for the family budget will be good!
The theater of the absurd continues!"
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" at the blind auditions, the son of Gradsky appeared.
I never thought of taking my son on my team.
He even said, "Come on, get out of here, I understand".
Agutin was unable to enter as a professional.
Canadian military allowed to wear beards to boost morale
The Canadian Ministry of Defence has issued an order allowing military personnel to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions on how to care for a beard.
The report notes that the military may be ordered to shave "for security reasons".
The beard of a soldier must be no longer than 2 cm, and must be neatly trimmed, and his neck and cheeks shaved.
Navy personnel were allowed to wear beards only on land.
The idea is to "boost morale in the military and attract more Canadians to the service".

Meanwhile, a court in Egypt upheld a decision to suspend police officers who wear beards.

Russia to fine for violations in share construction
From tomorrow, Russia will start to fine for violations in the field of share construction, reports the channel "Russia 24".
Companies and officials will be punished if they do not provide the data on the building to the Unified Housing Information System in time.
The innovation will help those who decide to buy a new apartment, but are afraid of the developer's bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Because of the amendments to the share building law, developers will have to borrow money from the bank.
And many experts have already spoken of a possible sharp rise in the price of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on Ivan Kudry Street, according to the capital's law enforcement.
According to the victim, the unknown man approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly took out a knife and demanded money and a mobile phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered him to withdraw the money from his bank card.
After the attacker received 4 thousand hryvnia and a phone, he hit the victim and fled", the report says.
The robber was detained by law enforcement officers, who found him to be a 25-year-old Kiev resident.
Now he faces up to seven years in prison.
Police are also working on a version of the perpetrator's involvement in other similar crimes.
We'll remind you that the day before yesterday, there were several high-profile thefts of collectors in Odessa.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a drone.
The scientist spoke about the possible scientific program of the Russian expedition to the Moon
Head of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community is now working on developing such directions.
"There is no consensus yet", he said.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space sources of radio radiation", added Petrukovich.
He also believes the moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organisms on the Earth's moon, he says.
It could help us figure out how life arises on planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos corporation said that in an optimistic scenario, Russia could launch a manned mission to the Moon by 2030.
A disgruntled customer dropped a basket of feces at a 7-Eleven .
Damian Simms, 41, of St. Petersburg, Florida, allegedly had a grudge against the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour convenience store, who had him fired in May for misconduct.
And decided to avenge his enemy in an original way.
At midnight, he went into the store and spilled the contents of a basket he had brought with him on the floor and on some of the shelves.
The trash contained feces and urine that Simms had "borrowed" from a nearby mobile toilet.
The police arrived at the scene and arrested the "avenger".
He was taken into custody and released on $300 bail.
He was charged with trespassing and criminal trespass, and was also barred from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime may seem more ridiculous than serious, the sentence may be severe because he has a history of serious crimes, including grand theft, robbery, illegal possession of a firearm, drunk driving, and animal cruelty.
The US named Russia 's most dangerous submarine
The most dangerous enemy submarine for the US Navy will be the Russian "Kazan" submarine of the "Yasen-M" project, writes The National Interest.
The submarine was launched in March 2017, but the Navy will receive it in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of the "Kazan" submarine "Severodvinsk" received high praise from the American military.
We're going up against a formidable potential adversary.
"Just look at the Severodvinsk", said Rear Admiral Dave Johnson.
The newspaper says that the United States retains an advantage over Russia in this area.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are being built according to the improved project "Yasen-M" (885M).
They have a displacement of 13,800 tons, a diving depth of 520 meters, a crew of 64 people, a 100-day autonomy, and a submersible speed of 31 knots.
The submarines are armed with mines, 533 mm torpedoes, and "Onix" and "Calibr" cruise missiles.
In August, the U.S. 6th Fleet said that the U.S. submarine force remains "the most powerful and fearsome on the planet".

Very impressive for a first game.
I think we'll keep him in the game.

This was announced by US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.

Zinke also noted that a similar situation exists with Iran.
The minister said there were two options for the situation: military and economic.
The first one he would prefer not to use, so we need to put pressure and push Iran's energy resources out.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Sergey Sirotikin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Russian Williams driver Sergey Sirotikin commented on the race result of the Russian Grand Prix.
"I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I was caught between two cars that immediately pinned me down.
I lost all the positions I had at the start, instantly, instantly.
Turned out to be a very bad position.
I got stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the others had pitched, we'd get some fresh air and get our pace back, but the tires were gone.
Plus, he fought his partner, had contact with him, too.
I understand he was a little off.
We were in this situation on the most unpaved track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was really painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore", - quotes the words of Orotkin RIA "News".
Sirotkin finished 18th in the Russian Grand Prix, with British Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton winning.
Tarpishev called the suspension of Glushakov and Yashchenko from the "Spartacus" base absurd
The President of the Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) Shamil Tarpishev commented on the suspension of Denis Glushakov and Andrey Yushchenko from the training with the main squad after he liked the criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It's a worldly folly to pay attention to such things.
I don't agree with what Carrera is doing.
It only makes the team more divided.
First, it's poetry, and you can read and interpret it any way you want.
I wouldn't react to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be buried.
Just because Glushakov and Yashchenko are putting up likes doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't help the team's mood.
Spartacus doesn't have a game tonight, so there was no need to make a big deal out of it.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
Spartacus has a lot of things wrong with the different lines, there's a lot of unrest after being brought in as a youth team.
The team's internal relations do not seem to be optimistic about this match", Tarpichev said.
The two teams' game will be held on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously turned down Spartak, took over the youth team at Chelsea.
Sirius students discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
Pupils of the "Sirius" educational center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The researchers' speech was part of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-Similar Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the educational center's website reported on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kody Kurchatov", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture was published on the Sirius website.
Students learned that modern technology requires a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
The challenge, the forum organizers say, is to use nature-like technologies that young scientists are working on.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of this technology is a unique thing, a tremendous benefit.
It's the explosion of medical technology, it's the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's another side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of living systems.
There's the flip side, which is a deliberate interference in human life.
There are always risks.
The car came along, people started dying under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction", the scientist was quoted as saying by REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing the current scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants.
The speakers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-nature-like technologies of the NIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technologies Вячеслав Demin.
The Sirius Education Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Education Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the education center is to identify, develop and further support gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the CyberVizzov all-Russian online Olympiad on information security will be sent to study at Sirius.
A flight attendant sacrificed his life to save a plane during an earthquake in Indonesia

Just look at "Severodvinsk", " he said, pointing to the model-precursor of "Kazani".

Macedonia: Referendum not held because of low turnout
The referendum was called to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "North Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic a path to NATO and later to the EU.
But only 34 percent of the voters "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50 percent, according to EFE.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse the name change.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonia's prime minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if more "yes" votes were cast, Macedonia would change its name despite the lack of a quorum.

A herd of sheep at the cemetery has upset Kemerov residents
On September 30, a well-known Kemerovo page on social media posted a report from an eyewitness that a local cemetery was being used by wild animals.
The animals ran in large herds between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some local residents noted that the presence of small cattle in the cemetery is not harmful, and their appetite can even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass, but some of the city residents did not like the behavior of the animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the sheep to do.
Of course, you can't say that they blaspheme about sheep, but it's not the case". (style preserved) - said in her message the outraged Kemerovo woman.
Anyway, someone from the witness said that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known and will be taken into account soon.
Push and pull, how's that?
There's no such thing as "pressure".
Right, finish.
The word "push" in the sense of "pull, influence, impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound "a" instead of "o" in the word "push".
We use this word to think it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "destruction" are not only etymologically unrelated, but even opposite in some sense.
See for yourself.
To obtain (church-book, obsolete) means "to be enough, full, enough, to be enough for someone or something, to satisfy".
Pleasure is a relative term.
It used to mean "not dependent on anything, self-sufficient" - "self-sufficient".
Old Slavic "dov'lti" is related to the words "command" and "will".
Pushing, suppressing, that's two different things.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "oppress".
The similarity of the phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "dovelet", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, caused them to become contaminated.
So we have this same "d[a]v[e]l", which is also used in writing as an "a", which is, thankfully, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
So, the right thing to do is to get it.
But that word is outdated, in its proper sense no longer used.
If you want to point out that some circumstances/people are having a negative influence on you from above, use the word "pressure".
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember, this is a desk.

In mid-September, relatives of the deceased Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan district court, in which it was reported that an executive action had been initiated against the 105-year-old woman.
The court ordered the woman to pay 200 rubles to the local tax office.
After receiving the letter, Slepneva's relatives appealed to the department for clarification.
The bailiff's office promised to take care of it.
Social media users, upon learning of the incident, advised relatives to file countersuits for non-payment of the old woman's pension and social benefits for the "lived" years after her death.
In 2016, a court in Kemerovo recognized a man who was considered dead.
The death certificate was supposed to be written in full, but they mistakenly wrote it to the wrong person.

With the help of the operation in Syria , Russia has protected itself from terrorists .
Over the three years of Russian military operations in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists have been killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Air Force.
This was stated by the former head of the Russian Air Force, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev, in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air missiles: The Air Force has been and continues to be able to strike precisely at terrorist targets.
Bondarev said that tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in the past three years, including munitions depots, fortifications and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes have broken through the jihadists' defences, a decisive step in advancing Syrian government forces, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIL, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, about four thousand militants from the Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the Islamic State, reports TASS.
And it's only about the people who have been identified, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism on the distant borders - otherwise this evil "would flow to us".

Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas it was targeting, it committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law", he said.
Muallem said the U.S. and its partners were providing "direct support to terrorists" as the militants and the Western coalition's goals in Syria coincided and meant "sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path".
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to rid Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority will be given to Syrian partners in the reconstruction of the country.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Warring Parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15s had struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus ammunition.
The United States has denied all charges.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a visit to the Kharkiv region, commenting on Hungary's issuance of its passports in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I'm protecting the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine", Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he will protect Ukrainian citizens as president, wherever they are - in the east or the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which intends to expel the consul of this country from Berezhov.
"I fully share every letter that the Foreign Ministry has said", the President noted.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which shows the moment of the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian consulate in Borehovo.
They swore allegiance to Hungary.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consul who appears on the video handing out Hungarian passports to Ukrainians must leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the prosecutor's office of the Transcarpathian region has opened a criminal case over the issue of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified as "treason".

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev 's decision to rename the UOC to fascist actions
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It is the same as in fascist Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", - said the Metropolitan in the broadcast of the television channel "Russia-24" (quoted by "Interfax").
According to him, this step will have the most serious consequences just now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev hopes to gain full control of the UOC and "put it out of the law", the cleric said.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country", he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of the draft laws No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy sites
The deputy of the Holy Eucharist Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy sites.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.
At different times in history, our forefathers and fellow Christians had to profess their faith and defend their sacred sites.
Given the situation, the information we have, and the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to live through something", the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The deputy of the Lavra also stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed".
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threatened with execution, and therefore we will defend our sanctuary".
Those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, should be ready to defend it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow those who mislead believers.
The UOC has a canonical status, defined by the Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make Bartholomew dependent on the novitiate patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope.
The new style and its consequences are unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status of our church", said the deputy of the lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 is canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a Tomos.
What more Tomos do we need?" said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other confessions have Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican.
The believers had some understanding and decided which temple they should go to.
Yet, someone wants to sow enmity and strife again.
Some people are jealous of the sparkling domes on the temples they want to destroy", the priest said.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century.

"It was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal", - quotes Vorobyov's official website "Automobilista".
"We tried to play it very simply.
I really liked the first period.
Missed a few good ones.
In the second period, the opponent pushed us a little, we held out.
But the removal has fed us a little.
The guys played great, they put on a coaching act.
I think if we keep playing the same way, the wins will come.
No goals, zero goals, no game, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we keep playing in that direction".
"Do you think the Motorist has gained in comparison to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"There was no foreign band playing.
In the preseason, the teams were doing other things, and there were a lot of young guys playing.
I think it was a completely different game, a different hockey.
The Motorman is a good team.
The scoreboard shows that the team is playing right.
Good hockey, good vibes in the arena and in the city.
All we can do is wish them luck.
The team's moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalie.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew the team was going undefeated, we wanted to break it, but we couldn't".

The main Macedonian oppositionist refused to vote in the referendum
On Sunday, September 30, a referendum is held in Macedonia on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece to rename the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPMNE) Christian Mitkowski said he would not vote in the referendum.
As party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky explained, Mitskowski decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "pernicious".
According to the spokesman, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, President Georgi Ivanov of Macedonia also refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that the name for the country he chose 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the country's renaming a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created", Ivanov noted.

The treaty should resolve the long-running dispute over the country's name, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, TASS reminds.

The U.S. is increasing opiate production in Afghanistan .
The sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan was widely reported in Tehran on September 26.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, the militants have launched a terrorist war on Afghan soil against the government and civilians.
This year has been a record year for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans", Patrushev noted.
The troubles in Afghanistan began not yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (banned in the Russian Federation) was declared the main enemy of the United States and has been established in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and its NATO allies launched Operation Unbreakable Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops are now on Afghan soil.
And the peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are being driven behind fences at dozens of their bases.
They're buying off the militants for money, as long as they're not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller portion of the country's territory - 40 percent, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% are ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they're growing fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia, just like they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
And it's also good that in the 17 years of American presence, the production of opiates in Afghanistan has increased at least 40-fold.
The enormous growth of the opium poppy plantations and the multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO if the country changes its name.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the homonymous Greek province and Greek history.
Ljupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope of social change.
And Greece will assert its right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make absolutely everyone happy".
The ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev are in favor of renaming the country.
The opposition is the conservative opposition and the president of the country, Georgy Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no reason to join the EU - it is enough to have partnership relations with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by Macedonian citizens will determine the future not only of the Balkans but of Europe as a whole".
