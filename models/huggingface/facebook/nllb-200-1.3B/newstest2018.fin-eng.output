Camille Auer wanted to repair her sexuality, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject of "A man should have the right to his own body".
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the ceiling of the Academy of Art's Project Room.
Every one of them has Camille Auer's name on it.
The papers tell the story of how outsiders have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Deciding for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell my personal treatment history, to show the violence of the process", says Auer.
By process, she's referring to the process of gender reassignment.
It is often a year-long study that involves meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process will start with a referral to the diagnostic studies for gender identity disorder, which will be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
The trial of Auer began four years ago.
Even before that, he had been using the estrogen he had ordered over the Internet and was already very far along in his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to be legally able to correct her gender.
The Trans Act, the Act on the Establishment of the Gender of Transsexuals (563/2002) obliges transsexuals to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct gender, for example, at the Population Register Centre and in a passport.
At present, every sex-rehabilitation provider is required to see a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive disability.
A man has the right to decide what he wants to do with his body.
"This situation is intolerable and a violation of human rights", says Auer.
The reform of the Trans-Line has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the ECHR to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government, led by the then Minister for Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovinen, prepared the amendment.
The elections came and the Finns took over.
Now the law is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes that have nothing to do with this particular law.
"The government does not want to bring it up because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law", says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty's Finnish section.
The front of the exhibition hall is dominated by two large installations.
One is the packaging and instructions for the medicines that Auer takes.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by the Transpol psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based this on her report, which would define Auer's right to treatment and to help.
The sense of reality under study seems to be susceptible to fluctuations.
The self-concept of the person being examined appears fragmented at a marginal level and the unstable characteristics of the personality are emphasised.
Auer did not identify himself from these images.
"It was a shock to learn that I had been diagnosed with a mental illness", says Auer.
Even more shocking was the refusal of Auer to receive sex-rectification treatment.
The medical staff said his resources were insufficient to initiate the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television set in the waiting room of the transpolis.
Later, this television became the basis for a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflects on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is born female can enlarge their breasts, but breast removal requires a diagnosis", says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything other than the sex you were born to be.
Unfortunately, the experience of Aurier is not unique.
For many, the process of sexual reproduction is more difficult for psychological reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified in their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment on the grounds that they do not have enough resources", says Auer.
Many people who have applied for the process have a background of psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
On the basis of these, the staff may order that treatment not be started.
"Hiding treatment and help can make a person even worse off than before the process began", says Auer.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and suicidal thoughts.
In the exhibition's editorial, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts all my adult life, and it is something that people usually find difficult to digest".
The depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started taking hormones, she felt better.
He was finally able to express feelings that had been present since childhood and adolescence.
Why a wide jaw didn't feel right for my body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"There is so much self-justification in speech, dress, tone of voice, and movement", she says.
Today, Auer already feels that she is being seen, she exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, casual comments from close ones could hurt a lot.
The most painful thing is when someone close to you abuses you.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they don't want to or can't internalize it", he continues.
However, not all transsexuals need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body dysphoria, in which the body or its parts can cause distress and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a lengthy research process, one cannot obtain official confirmation of one's own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies", says Auer.
And it is true.
For example, in Denmark, the Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination as regards legal gender.
The adult applicant shall make a written application for a new identity card stating that he or she considers himself or herself to be of the other sex.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall issue him with a new identity card.
This right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this demand is reflected in the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but rather a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has a place and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick from 4 to 28 July 2017 at the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The Civil Rights Association issued a travel warning for Missouri .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a travel advisory for Missouri, citing discriminatory practices and racist attacks in the state.
NAACP's Missouri Travel Information, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and locals to exercise extreme caution and caution when traveling in the state that has recently experienced a number of questionable racially motivated incidents, the NAACP said in a statement.
A recent law in Missouri makes it harder to bring discrimination cases to court, and state law enforcement is disproportionately targeting minorities, which the NAACP says led to the travel advisory.
"The civil rights of the people are violated.
They are stopped because of the color of their skin and beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri chapter of the NAACP, to the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time".
The Missouri travel advisory is the first ever travel advisory issued by the organization for a U.S. state.
The organization cited as examples the racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year, driving across the state when his car ran out of gas, and he was arrested by the Missouri State Police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel advisory also referred to a study by the Missouri attorney general that found that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police than white drivers.
"The purpose of the travel advisory is to urge people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and coworkers about what may happen in Missouri", Chapel says.
People must prepare, for example, by taking money with them to pay for guarantees or by telling relatives that they plan to travel through the state.
According to the FBI, Missouri had 100 hate crimes in 2015, making it the 16th most violent state in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, a constitutionally-sanctioned civil rights organization, recently issued travel advisories to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws that require police to arrest people for immigration violations, which the organization says increases racial profiling.
While travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department and are for other countries, more recently they have been issued by NGOs in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
General: Linti asked Finnair for a statement on the supplementary pension of the CEO
The Minister for Economic Affairs and the State Ownership Board, Mika Lintiä (Central), has asked Finnair to provide an explanation of the supplementary pension payment received by the airline's CEO, Pekka Vauramo, Yle reports.
The Minister said that it was against the will of the government.
The additional pension of 130 000 euros received by Vauramon was highlighted this week when the Helsinki newspaper reported on the development of the remuneration of the directors of listed companies.
The Finnish daily Bild newspaper reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would waive the additional pensions in 2013.
The government has made it clear that the supplementary pensions will not be used for rewarding.
The State owns more than half of Finnair.
The company claims that the decision is in line with the decision in principle on ownership control last year.
Sanctions immediately hardened the talks
It seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were going from cold to warm.
President Donald Trump of the United States and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who met at the G20 summit in Hamburg, appeared to get along well.
The mood has cooled considerably since then.
Russia reacted bitterly to the new economic sanctions passed by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
The most shocking response so far has been from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that Trump's signature of the asylum bill means a "full-scale trade war".
While Russian reactions would be characterized as political rhetoric, the escalation between the United States and Russia is a fact of life in the short honeymoon since Trump's election.
In the United States, passing the refugee laws for Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
Although Congress passed the bill with considerable unanimity, the president was reportedly having a much harder time getting the bill passed.
Trump recently criticized the law he signed as "significantly flawed".
President Trump's nervousness is probably due in particular to Russia, although the adoption of a law that would limit his own sovereignty must have been repugnant.
As is well known, the United States is investigating both possible Russian interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
With the White House staff changing hands and various scandalous twists being revealed almost every day, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not conducted under the direction of the president but in spite of the president.
This is not a desirable situation.
If the Russian relationship is a blur in the United States, so too is the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core area in the Baltic Sea is also straining relations.
The EU has made a prominent point about the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
Although the Union has so far remained at least superficially united in its policy on Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State like Finland, which has a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real boon.
The impact of the new U.S. refugee law is still unclear.
In the EU, there have been fears that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
The acidification in Europe has been caused by the exemption of, for example, liquefied natural gas, which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of dissent in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and carefully considered.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
The Trump White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The statues being touched is a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as anyone: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologues in the Trump administration, knew very well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta, when the Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a rhetorical debate over the president's proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller wasn't really criticizing the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise organizers and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
His attack was aimed at the significance of the statue and especially the fact that in 1903 the statue's pedestal was added to the poem by Emma Lazarus  17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller put it this way: "I don't want to go into the history of it, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller wasn't wrong, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
What is essential are Lazarus's touching words, the only ones of their kind, in which the state invites not only immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore".
The poem is more relevant now than ever.
Miller was not a literary critic, he made it clear that the poorest of the poor are not welcome in Trump's America.
The debate over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a larger political and cultural debate over the significance of the United States.
After his death, friends of Lazarus campaigned for the poem to be affixed to his statue, knowing full well that the act was highly political.
The statue was intended to represent the links between French and American republicanism in a classic metaphor, the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the word: in his poem, the female character is no longer an abstract figure, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: Mother of the Exiled.
The incorporation of poetry into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating assault on the American nationalist ideology.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a leading figure who can now be considered a sort of predictor of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an invitation to anyone, but an early precursor to the neoconservatives, who will take the lightning bolt of America to the world of darkness: Lady Liberty will come forth.
He's taking the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The soap doesn't show the way to the United States.
Oddly enough, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty is entirely up to the point of view.
Lazarus saw them as poor and tired but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by offering hope and welcoming.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torches do not show the way but kindle the flames of anger, their only source of strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsmen made the Great Britain national team
Neil Black, head of the British Athletics Federation, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team competing in the World Championships are 'a significant reinforcement'.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday.
Black said there was something special happening in Scotland that British sport has to learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to investigate it as long as we understand what is at stake", Black says.
I spoke to the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was part of the Institute's work.
The Scottish General Athletic Association believes that it is linked to the activities of the Association,
And the British General Athletic Association believes that it's because of their actions.
And the average passerby will guess that he must have something to do with it.
But it's something really great, whatever the reason.
Many Scottish athletes are competing for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who is competing with Sir Mo Farahi in the 5,000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the national team captain.
Eilidh is a lowly man.
"The captain's speech was incredibly brilliant", Black says.
 Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated, wherever they happen to live and train.
Yesterday's words were genuine feelings and passion for the sport.
Eilidh Doyle, Commonwealth silver medalist in the 400m hurdles, in his fifth World Championships, thinks it's "incredible" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven years from 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records in one year.
He's competing in London in the 1500m and 5000m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1500m in London, is another to watch: he's had a great season, including victories at the British Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "very proud" that so many Scots are involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
"It's a great honour to be named captain, but it's even more special because the national team voted for the captain", Doyle said.
Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are in as accomplished athletes competing for medals.
My captain's speech?
I think it went really well.
I was just focusing on how lucky we are to have house cats.
It's important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to race there and I know the atmosphere will be amazing.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The American people loved George Washington, but soon the newspapers began to criticize him for all possible domestic policies, from his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was irritating.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
"If freedom of speech is taken away, we may be led dumb and silent like sheep to the slaughter", Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked those who posted them.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the interview unfounded, and the attitude was demeaning online as well.
"What does it matter? It's just Facebook", many people commented.
But it does matter.
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is the surprisingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He's got the second-best rating out of 50 governors.
Hogan doesn't react easily to heat.
He's led the state steadfastly and firmly on principle.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as his primary channel of communication with his constituents, posting a photo of his bald head in chemotherapy.
The governor's Facebook page is a public and official forum, maintained by his staff with taxpayer funds, and therefore blocking users from visiting it is unnecessary and even dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was merely a matter of moderating comments.
But labeling commenters as trolls, spammers, or haters is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed people who blocked Hogan's Facebook page.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their elected leaders, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, pastors, for example.
They said that their comments were respectful, considerate, and appropriate.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comments; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile, but asked about hate crimes.
"I'm politely disappointed that Hogan hasn't taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news stories", he wrote in comments to the Washington Post news report.
"I also cannot accept that when more than one person comments on the same subject, they are immediately seen as somehow organised and dismissed as a large group of concerned citizens".
The governor's staff called the comments "a centralized attack".
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to control communication by blocking a critic or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers that had critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But it's really the same thing, just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump's blocked Twitter users have sued him.
The first major decision on the matter was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria Circuit Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter's Facebook account.
And the American Civil Liberties Union went to talk to Republican Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be too hard.
In Washington, the effect of cheap postal services was similar to the effect of the Internet today.
Newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers scoffed at Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers, denouncing the decisions of Washington.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the US-UK agreement on cooperation, trade and shipping, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
Yet, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership is about accepting that fact.
The birds should be stopped feeding in the summer immediately.
We've had samples from about a dozen sites, plus online reports from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southern Finland, but also from Haapavedu and Seinäjoen, says specialist researcher Marja Isomursu Evirasta.
The green snake has died of a disease called trichomoniasis.
It is caused by a primate, properly called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has been known to attack pigeons, especially the pea.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also being detected in poultry.
2009 was a pretty good year.
At that time, trichomoniasis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green pepper, after which the species' stocks have been on the verge of recovery.
Sick green beans have been around for a while, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, director of the University of Helsinki's Central Museum of Natural History.
The fear is that the previous epidemic of legumes will recur unless something is done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop feeding the birds in the summer immediately.
More on that later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-court advantage at the Renaissance Club .
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of the home advantage over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, a Northern Irishman who led the tournament at nearby Archerfield Links in the pre-final round last year but ultimately lost to Paul Eales, has been pleased with the new position and is serving as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I've been watching the Renaissance Club build, and with this event it will reach its full glory", says Rafferty.
The players will see the field at its best, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an avid ambassador for the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great introduction to this field.
Eales, from England, is defending the title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels like a really special occasion", says the Southport-based player.
I couldn't defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
I'm just going to go back to last year, and I think winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time, and we'll always remember it.
Gary Orr is returning to the real world on his own soil, having joined the tour earlier this year on his 50th birthday.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing in the home is always more meaningful than usual", says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I've been enjoying the game again, and I've been playing pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far.
The trio will join former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior majors winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will feature six Scotsmen: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free of charge and car parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds are donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
The bag was used to check for possible air problems inside the barracks .
At least so far, no internal air problems have been found in the barracks of the Por Brigade's mail company in the bag, the brigade said Thursday.
We're continuing the internal atmospheric surveys.
The investigation began when a man who had suspended his military service for health reasons suspected that his health was deteriorating because of the poor air conditioning inside the barracks.
According to the commander of the brigade in Pori, Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, there are no problems with the health of the other Marines.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and no other members of that unit had any health problems.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
At the moment, it is not known whether we will have any indoor air problem, Holma says.
The Prikat press release says that the arrival of the July march has forced the transfer of goods to the barracks, which may have caused a momentary increase in dust.
Holma says that could have made the air seem stuffy.
Poverty and Death in the Gold Country of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove in her cooking.
He rarely uses the kettle.
Degei, who lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Panay region in Indonesia's troubled Papua province, usually cooks dinner by putting potatoes  locally nota  directly on his stove.
After half an hour, the potatoes are roasted in a pan and eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
Dege's home has no furniture, and he sits on a muddy floor, where he usually also does his daily chores, such as washing laundry in the same water he collected from a nearby swamp.
The toilet's job is to deliver a bucket in an unroofed room.
Degei is the youngest of his husband's four wives, and he has no assignment to work the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, many drink heavily, and there are soldiers to be reckoned with.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening", says Degei.
This is a rare glimpse of a mountain range in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 and preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which has tight control of the area and blocks foreign journalists and human rights monitors from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the eastern part of the island being part of Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and rugged place, a one-and-a-half-hour flight from the provincial capital of Jayapur to Nabire, and a five-hour drive in a rental car.
There's no public transportation here.
The city of some 19,000 people is surrounded by bamboo-lined wooden houses, whose corrugated wafer roofs are colored yellowish-brown.
Very few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago tribe of Papua worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have clothes like this", says Degei, referring to her colorful, hand-woven wrap-around head, dark mustache and brightly colored sweater.
Before, we had nothing but leaves covering our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 percent of its population living below the poverty line, and the infant mortality and illiteracy rates are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also the gold of Indonesia.
Paniai is a hill country roughly the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants, and just about 100 kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most productive gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papa has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
But for the Papuans, these riches bring misery, for they mean the stifling presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local units of the military nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, and paid up to $150,000 to individual officers.
The demands of the bean for greater autonomy threaten this source of income and are silenced without mercy.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, the Indonesian military has killed more than 500,000 papuan people and raped, tortured, and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the highlands of the Papuans in the 1970's had reached the level of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region during peaceful protests.
The 2016 report from the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, contains reports of atrocities over the past year, including executions without trial, torture  rape and electrocution are particularly popular  and ruthless attacks on peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because cases are occurring on a weekly basis", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslims from the populous Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi move to the area in hopes of better livelihoods.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado rice mixed in peanut sauce.
It's hard to compete with the locals.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the marketplace for less than the locals", says Abeth You, 24, a resident of Pania who moved to the provincial capital to find work.
Local women lost their customers.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo , nicknamed Jokowi , pledged during his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights abuses in Papua.
Papua is made up of 29 districts, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 districts, including Pania, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice", You says.
The Pania experienced a kind of wave base just two months after the Yokoi October inaugurations.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by the fire in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorbikes in the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use traffic lights.
One soldier didn't like the remark, but according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses report that drunken soldiers took the children and beat them with rifle butts.
So one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, slipped into a coma as a result of the abuse.
A few hours later, the state election commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began.
About a thousand Papuans - young men, women, and children - gathered in front of the local police station and military command center on the soccer field to demand justice.
They brought with them their ceremonial hunting bows and began performing the traditional waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, which involves dancing in a circle and imitating the song of birds.
Some of the protesters started throwing stones at police and military buildings.
As the atmosphere heated up, the soldiers received an order from the internal radio system: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them to death". This information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been released to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, a resident of Kego Koto, sensed the situation was spiraling out of control and urged the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine, painted brightly on the porch of his wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"Several shots were fired at the evacuation site.
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him", Yohanes told TIME magazine, sadly, "and like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him.
Yotje Mende, the chief inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papua police spokesman, in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made a touching speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
I want this case investigated immediately so that it never happens again.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would initiate investigations into human rights violations outside the judicial system.
But he immediately began to withdraw his remarks.
Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but that requires certain processes, he said.
In a TIME interview in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying he was not going to start an investigation on the Pope.
"Everything will be settled in court", he told me.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity" related to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the 1999 bloody independence referendum in East Timor. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been solved, including the Pan-Asian incident.
The families of the victims of the panic attack are taking the allegations with a dark disbelief.
'I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but nothing has come of it', says Yohanes.
I'm tired of this.
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I am afraid", he says.
I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me.
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Pannonians are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me after the burial of the victims", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in the Paniai neighborhood of Deiya.
One man was killed and 17 were injured in a clash between villagers and a construction company manager, which began when the manager refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man in need of medical attention was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been washed up while fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated on the construction site in front of the company office.
Police say villagers stoned officers, who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a mobile unit of Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of revenge", said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to the hospital.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiya parliament has demanded that the police officers who fired the shots be held accountable and that the mobile police unit be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fuelling discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the rugged middle-range areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuans' Liberation Movement (PMO), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by means of occasional attacks and the kidnapping of Indonesian military soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Pannians, like Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the insurgency by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "securing national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
There's only a little rice at Enarotal, and it's too expensive for the locals,
And so is bread.
People grow their own food: mostly potatoes and some fruits and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may have four or five potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten potatoes are only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
The difference between the livelihoods of local residents and those of migrants has increased over time, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabir Airport.
Jobs are scarce and tend to go to the more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Only a few Papuans have the capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money", says Paniain Tribal Council chairman John Gobai.
Out-of-the-way Papua is a little-known place in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from the Vatican, despite receiving a rare permit to film, on the grounds that they were unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
According to Phelim Kinen, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi has failed to keep his election promises, not to increase transparency and not to promote development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Reporters covering Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's most volatile eastern provinces, face new risks: visa denial and being blacklisted", Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States  Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands  called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the numerous and widespread violations in Papua, including the shooting incident in Panay.
These states have also traditionally supported the Papuan liberation movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that Indonesia is still a democracy with a free press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar visited Jayapur on 4 May 2017, the locals broke their silence and expressed their desire for freedom, said a source who attended the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Indonesia is in the midst of a presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi means well, but he's surrounded by people who are involved in the Pania shooting", says tribal council chairman Gobai.
He wants Jokowi to know the plight of the Panayans: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in scarcity and poverty, with virtually no health care and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the Panians, like other Papuans, hold the votes they gave Jokowi as a debt to be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Panay shooting demonstrated yet another symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military base.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed", says Yacobus, his head in the air.
What else could we do?
Dereck Chisora bemoans the cancellation of the Robert Helenius rematch: "Even his own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora blames the reason for the rematch flop entirely on Helenius.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora says.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a packed Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point verdict.
Tickets for the rematch were selling well, and promoter Nisse Sauerland told Evening News in May that the match had been moved to the autumn.
We haven't heard anything new about the fight since.
But the withdrawal no longer hurts Chisora.
I mean, the fight would probably have had to be canceled anyway, after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up in severe pain.
My tire was about to explode.
At the hospital, they told me I needed an operation, Chisora told me.
Britt says he's about 45 percent fit right now.
He's not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but he's looking for Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat at Whythe in December, in a disjointed tone.
The torchlight in Dubai is coming back to haunt you.
The world's tallest residential building in Dubai caught fire on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story building, which is 1,300 feet tall.
This was the second fire in two years in the building that happens to be called the Torch, the torch.
The building was evacuated, and no one was injured, and the cause of the fire was not immediately understood.
We were asleep and we woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about 10 minutes, a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai fire and rescue officials said the fire was extinguished at 4 a.m. local time and the firefighters stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who had left their homes.
The case could raise questions again about the safety of materials used in the exterior of tall buildings around the world.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
In Britain, police believe that the insulation and curtain plates of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of flames in the fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in River Valley last night.
A motorcycle was stolen from a parking lot in River Valley between 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday and 5:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Nineveh at the address of Mount Tickanem 2.
Mopo was the Sky Team Monkey.
It's red in color and registered as 27-REV.
Mopo was found later Thursday.
Police request any information regarding the sighting or seizure of the scooter by e-mail to:
You'll need JavaScript support to view it, or call the police update on 0295 415 320.
As of 12.40pm on August 3, 2017, police have announced that a moped has been found.
More than 20 percent of airline passengers in the United States take prohibited items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air travelers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had knowingly or unknowingly taken prohibited items on board planes past TSA checkpoints, and at least 6 percent of passengers had knives or other sharpened objects that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1 percent said that they only found out later that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey, conducted by charter airline Stratos Jet Charters and involving more than a thousand passengers, also revealed that younger passengers are more likely to defy regulations.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules, 19.7% were Millennials and less than 15% were Generation X.
The most common violation was bringing food and liquids on board.
More than three percent admitted to knowingly bringing steel-plated items on board, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men reported knowingly bringing illicit drugs on board.
The survey, which was conducted among travelers across the United States, sought to find out how many had accidentally and knowingly taken contraband goods past security screening.
It is not surprising that the most travelling people are also more likely to smuggle contraband past security checks  whether they know it or not.
But as the company that did the survey notes, the TSA's guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids they are allowed to take on board and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a time, there was also a general belief that books were not allowed on airplanes.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his decision to delay the Obama-era decision to reduce emissions.
The day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's smoke-reducing emissions decisions.
Mr Pruitt said the change showed that the agency he heads was taking better account of the needs of the environmental decision-makers in the Länder than in previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention a word about the action brought against his earlier decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Member States should start complying with the 2015 standard for surface ozone from 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year to give his agency more time to study the plan, as the agency 'does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth'.
Pruitt, who was the attorney general of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA, is known for his opposition to tighter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of heart is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the EPA director had overstepped his authority in trying to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision to shut down the oil and gas companies, which required the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his full transposition of the ozone regulations only strengthens EPA's cooperation with the states in the complex process of meeting the new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the agreement on deadlines", Pruitt said.
We do not believe in regulatory litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us Finns.
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt may continue to use its "powers to delay the execution of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions are "reasoned and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone regulations in Congress.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the bill.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group will continue to press.
"The EPA's change of heart as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the action was brought in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
The ozone in the earth's surface is produced when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups and is a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health and environmentalists were all overjoyed by Pruitt's sudden change of direction.
"It's alarming how much pressure it took for the guy responsible for our breathing to use common sense", says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must fight the Trump administration, which ideologically aims to operate on the terms of polluters and other self-serving groups".
"From a supercar manufacturer to a street racer, "it's like Ferrari".
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen Ferrari-style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a press conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar maker presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All the cases of the same type of virus in Eastern Sava
The coastal salmonella outbreak is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, reports THL.
The virology laboratory of the Department of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Sava is the same strain of the virus as the previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed by a person from Coastal Salish on Friday 28 July is the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all the infections in the Eastern Sava are related to the first case of measles in the region in June.
And that's good news, because it means that we haven't detected any other types of measles viruses.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth case may emerge as early as mid-August and the epidemic is not over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a doctor in charge of infectious diseases at Soster's primary health care.
No new cases of measles or suspected cases have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone keeps their own vaccination up to date, Erkki reminds us.
More on the subject: Three new cases of measles confirmed in the Pirkanma - "Over-infection or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a legal scream
Pontika soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
The reasoning is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with alcohol.
Making scallions at home will be legal next year, but the idea of legalizing pontika soup is not even being considered.
The shield is made by the spinning wheel, the brandy by the distillation.
The reason for the regulation of the distillation process is that it produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to alcohol.
There is no political will to regulate pontika soup as a human right, said Ismo Tuominen, a member of the government's Social Affairs and Health Ministry.
When the ministry was preparing to reform the alcohol law, the distillation of pontica was not considered for legalization.
Nor was the matter brought to the political table.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following:
He is on the negotiating team of the governing party parliamentary groups that took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
The permit for distilling pontica at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial production will also remain subject to authorisation.
Toominen is saying that home brewing is becoming a simple rule: you can make alcohol at home with a barbecue.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make screams at home.
The government has been keen to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and allows the manufacture of chalk, a type of sparkling wine.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings resulting from their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
The new law allows you to make as many drinks as you want, and you can give away homemade alcohol.
It's still not for sale.
The practice of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland comes from Estonia.
The liquor bill is now under review by the Justice Department.
The Alcohol Act will be introduced in the House as soon as the fall term begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's as if the House has already taken a stand.
Oscar Pistorius was taken to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, suffering from chest pain, was admitted to a South African hospital on suspicion of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his sentence at the Atteridgeville Correctional Facility.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest stones, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesman for Pistorius' family said the former world-class athlete is in good health.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February of 2013.
Intercepted phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build a border wall.
A transcript of a telephone conversation between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia has been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop publicly speaking about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States blamed Nieto for publicly dismantling the wall project.
Trump started his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a letter from Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which he had a tense exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the US would take refugees on their way to Australia was "ridiculous", "crazy" and "stupid". Trump said the deal negotiated during the Obama era would make him look "idiot" because he had proposed banning refugees from settling in the US.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that it was the most unpleasant call of the day.
Georgian massacre: Activists reenact racist lynching in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car can reach the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man in a racing suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and sweeps through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
Roger, the man is stinking.
Get out of the car!
The screams break the silence as a young black man is dragged out of the front seat.
This shocking event is fortunately a re-enactment of the one that was shown on July 22, 2017.
But the sigh of shock is real when the hangman's eye is put on Roger's neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reenact the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with the murders.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested in all these years, even though the killers are alive and many people need to know who they are", says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the re-enactment.
It is a shameful mark of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the reenactment is a startling call to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want the guilty to be brought to justice, we want things to be finally resolved, and we want to heal from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice", Brooks said.
We can't recover and make amends until we get justice.
A coroner covers the body of a victim of the Georgia massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been out for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have been known to the locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Supreme Court granted blacks in Georgia the right to vote in presidential elections for the first time, and the Supreme Court issued its decision in April, with the elections held in the summer.
The FBI says that during the election there was an incident where a black tenant farmer, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently involved Malcolm's wife, Dorothy.
Brooks said there was a rumor going around town that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her child.
According to FBI records, on July 25, 1946, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcolm's $600 bail, which was used to get him out of prison.
On the way home, Malcolm and Dorothy were joined by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob pulled their car over the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It has emerged that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders", the FBI report states.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, who were complicit in the murders, destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identities of the witnesses".
Brooks is more concise.
"It was voter murder", he says.
They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that they would be killed if they voted.
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of the Georgia massacre for almost a decade.
The play is extremely realistic and captivating, a depiction of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of today.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to see what Green thinks it's about.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark side", says the director.
But I can't have a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through.
This year's performance began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen black and a dozen white - gathered to hear Green's routine recap of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Green's assistant director.
He's been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader in a reenactment for years, but the role is always as difficult and obnoxious.
"I get dirty because I'm not myself", Marbaugh says.
It is important, however, that this side of history is also brought to the fore, so that it will never be repeated.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, known as Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their lines.
The show opens with Malcolm screaming and punching Hester, furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
I said get out of my country, man!
Rascona, or Hester, is in.
Then the punch comes.
And then everybody (at least all the black actors) will burst out laughing.
Greene is the one laughing the hardest.
What? "Rascona asks.
She's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
No, Greene is a freak.
I just don't think white people used the word "n" back then.
Yes, another black actor confirms.
It's slang, you'll have to use a longer version.
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is overwhelming even for the friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, but to honor the memory of those who died.
The scene starts again.
Now Rascona's words are clear.
No one is laughing.
The reenactment will end quickly and violently.
Shouting, shots fired and silence.
A woman in a black funeral dress stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
Her voice breaks with every word.
A few dozen yards away, fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half the audience is black and half white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They've been to the graves of the victims under Brooks' guidance in the overwhelming humidity of Georgia.
The murders have become a story, a reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing, Greene invites the crowd to examine the bodies.
Children will stare at the artificial blood and the still bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead", the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who played lynch mobsters take off their coats and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who posed as the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry, the woman in the show is comforting".
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and the cast will gather for a dinner.
A white couple from the Gulf discuss the performance with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinsky has a hard time finding words to describe the feelings she feels about the performance.
"It's hard to hear horrible words and watch terrible things being said and done by people who look like you", he says, "just because they look like you".
'My presentation made me realize that lynchings are still happening,' he added. 'They're just called arrests.'
On the other side of the room, Brooks is reminding the audience of the advancement of civil rights at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"Re-enactment is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we've experienced, but it's also an educational experience", says Brooks.
The message is that this could happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.
The hanging of plants in shops is a big deal: this is how much "extra" parts are actually saved by removing them
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the cauliflower before weighing?
How about taking the big hat off the pineapple? It weighs a lot.
The answers are sharply divided: for some it is a sign of extreme ingenuity, while others do not want to pay for the parts of their vegetables that they do not use and that go to the garbage at home.
I'm sure you'll recognize it in the shops.
For example, in the K-Citymarket vegetable section of the Helsinki area, you can find cardboard boxes because many people tear off the leaves of cauliflower, for example.
The box is used to transport the leaves to the bio-waste store.
According to a news report in the Economic Times, the shopkeeper is surprised by the sight of a vegetable table.
But how much money does removing excess vegetable parts before weighing actually save?
How significant is the intelligence tool really?
We women tested how the price changes when leaves are taken or the leaves are removed from pineapple, lettuce, artichoke, sweet potato, and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: A cauliflower that cost €2.10 turned out to be worth €1.80 when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple, which cost €2.30, dropped to €1.95 when its cover was folded.
The price of the flat-rate item: from EUR 2,60 to EUR 2,40 when the short-term item was removed.
Sweets: Two sweets cost 75 cents.
The air bearings cost 60 cents.
A medium-sized parsackal cost 1 euro and 80 cents without a holder.
The result: If leaves and stems are picked, saving a few inches on one vegetable is best.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables dropped by as much as 20 percent.
So, all together, these purchases would have saved you $1.20!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona , the bronze star has signed a five-year contract with PSG .
Brazil's star player Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, AFP reports.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a Spanish football club, a €222 million buy-out.
The transfer of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league halted the move earlier Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first bid for a transfer.
According to the league rules, the purchasing club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by circulating the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid a sum to Neymar and his representatives who supplied money to Barcelona through the league.
It is believed that Neymar will arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a potential new home crowd at the opening game of the season for PSG against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA is looking into the details.
Barcelona also stated in its communication that it would provide information on the payment to UEFA in order to enable the association to determine the possible disciplinary action to be taken in the event.
In particular, the President of the Spanish Football League, Javier Tebas, has alleged that PSG is in breach of UEFA's financial fair play rules by using its money.
UEFA may fine a club that makes more than EUR 30 million in losses over three years.
UEFA has said that Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its financial clause.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will affect the club's finances for several years to come, but the impact cannot be predicted in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial sums, UEFA was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The association is chaired by former Qatari tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from the lightning strike. The flash was recorded on airport security cameras.
Austin Dunn was doing normal work on a plane at Lounas Florida International Airport with a couple of his coworkers when suddenly a rainy sky flashed into the plane.
The force of the lightning threw the plane to the ground near the wing of the Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother had an electrical accident and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a cerebral hemorrhage.
It was a difficult experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn tells us.
The airport representative said that the lightning warning system was on at the time of the incident and that the airline would decide whether to comply with it.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividends
British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it embarks on a new restructuring programme in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the main job cuts will take place at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, and the company has already reduced 4 000 jobs in the context of previous restructuring arrangements.
Pearson announced further cost cuts of £300 million in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive businesses weakened by rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in publishing house Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, which announced that it would keep its outlook for the year unchanged, with sales up 1% in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has struck a military road in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
According to NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, with 30 people killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to the NATO statement, the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "self-made explosive device carried by a person".
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the Taliban's strengthening and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 percent of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area predominantly populated by Shiite Muslims.
The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the most devastating attack by a militant group in the country since the US-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the fragile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send additional troops to help local military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly weakened people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay enforcement of smoking regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's emissions reduction policies a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 Wotson Definitions late on Wednesday, which the agency said was a sign of its commitment to working with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states", said Scott Pruitt, the agency's director, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone measurements by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, the smoke emissions are measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, claiming the moratorium was unlawful.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to ease environmental regulations under President Barack Obama, which Trump says are part of a broader program to boost economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of rising emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior figure in the ISIS had also sent the bomb's construction parts to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be flown on July 15th, but the attempt was aborted before security checks.
Police have not been able to provide any details as to why the operation was halted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that would release a toxic colorless gas and take the device to a public place, such as a public transportation system.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever devised in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday in connection with suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation is continuing.
CEO of Liquid: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before tax fell, but beat its forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Matti Lievosen, CEO, the company performed well in the oil products segment, sales of renewable products reached record levels and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was on the right track.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax credit.
According to Mr Lievosen, the operating profit for renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief was terminated.
Our strategy is progressing well.
The Commission also notes that the Commission's decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure was taken by the Commission in the context of the investigation procedure.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomashenko discussing a possible match on their first date
Vasyl Lomashenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course for the most exciting fight of the near future in the under-66.7 kg series, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their rooms at the ESPN sports network's Los Angeles offices until the undefeated WBC lightweight champion, Mikey Garcia, walked down the hall to greet Lomashenko, the WBO's top featherweight champion.
Garcia won Saturday on Showtime with a unanimous decision by former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, and since then Garcia and Lomashenko have been in the top five in a comparison of boxers in different weight classes.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, Master?"
Good luck with the fight!
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7:00 on Saturday.
When the pair posed for photographers, Lomashenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that the match between the men would be "perfect" in terms of size.
"I'm a former featherweight", Garcia recalled.
I moved the series up for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small, I weigh about 63.5 pounds.
I want to get back in the light.
He's got to get on the 61-pound raft, and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's give them what they want.
Lomatchenko agreed with me.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a pay-per-view channel, part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, who will make his debut in the lightweight division later this year and fight Garcia next summer (37-0 with 30 knockouts). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight division at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight could be on a pay channel because the fans have asked for it", Garcia said, later announcing that he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
We're the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention as you.
I'm fine with it, as soon as we make a deal...
Garcia said he appreciated Lomatchenko as an incredible fighter and that he was planning on maybe going to see the fight on Saturday.
Lomatchenko interrupted Garcia's boasting about his sword and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow".
Garcia said he focused on showing off his punching power first and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the desire to have a match between them was growing stronger.
This is the game we've been waiting for.
No other match has attracted so much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case, Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he was looking forward to fighting the best.
It's going to be a great fight.
Average salary of 5,300 euros, education what happens - investment advisory situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a big deal lately.
Lastly, Helsinki News reported on Ritva, 68, who was talked into a full-fledged bubble by investment advisers in the banking business when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The new financial market directive, which will be implemented from the beginning of next year, will be the basis for the tightening measures.
The current assessment of the competence of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is based mainly on self-regulation.
The law does not define the requirements for competence.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment services sector complete their own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of the degrees to a firm called APV Investment Studies Oy, whose examination team includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The examinations are 12-15 credits and are prepared by Aalto EE, the provider of management development services, Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The degree programme includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Oy, says that the pass rate for the exams is roughly around 70 percent.
The staff of the largest banks are almost all investment services providers who have completed either the APV1 or APV2 examinations, as these are compulsory under the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller banking firms, not to mention names, whose staff seem to have shunned graduation, says Savikko.
He says that such banking operations are "changing".
According to Savikko, since 2000 13 000-14 000 persons have completed the APV1 qualification and around 3 000 persons have completed the more demanding APV2 qualification recommended for investment advisers.
Some banking firms consider graduating a degree an advantage.
Many other sectors have much stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Industry requires the completion of the APV qualifications, because then the knowledge related to the investment sector is guaranteed.
According to the Statistical Office, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros a month, including commissions, bonuses and income bonuses.
The average monthly wage for regular working hours is about EUR 5 300.
Men working in jobs earn an average of just over EUR 5 900 per month, while women earn over EUR 4 500.
The top ten earners earn an average of about 8 100 euros.
The top ten men earn more than €9,000 a month or more, and the top ten women earn €6,400 or more.
The investment advice under the Investment Services Act may only be given by a company authorised to do so.
The Commission has been able to find out what the Commission is doing.
The Commission notes that the investment firm's activities are not limited to the investment firm's own business activities.
In principle, it is also possible to operate as a seller of investment products even if the level of professional skills and qualifications is low.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have much stricter skills requirements, Savikko says.
According to Savikko, this will be tightened up from the beginning of next year with the new financial markets directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each firm be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently qualified.
The financial supervisor, for his part, will be given the power to determine what he must know.
Markets regulator Marko Hovi of FIBA says that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the requirements for the skills and experience of investment advisers and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the own staff of investment firms and to the agents of the parties selling products on behalf of an undertaking.
The Court notes that the Government proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance gives Fiva the power to impose competence and experience.
As to what they are, let us decide on these views in the coming autumn.
The company must also provide the necessary training and, where necessary, follow-up and follow-up training.
This must be documented and the company has an obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The Court states that in practice, for example, the company must identify the activities of its staff at individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or sales of products.
The new requirement, according to Hov, is to work with someone with more experience if the level of knowledge or experience is not adequate.
So if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the criteria, the employee must work for a certain period of time with the person who meets the criteria.
The Court said that the amendment would tighten the rules and make them more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "pictured" a giant plane over the United States
The flight path was mapped over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was made on Thursday by a 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the long-range durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew 9,500 miles [15,700 km] in 18 hours and 1 minute, longer than any regular commercial airline flight in the world.
The flight remained within the United States for the entire flight.
It flew through 17 states.
The steadfast beach schoolchildren of Imatra , not to be outdone by the rain or the sun , were all polished with the help of a bathing suit .
Iineskonen was moving at a good pace, Taina Teikonen was following.
Imatra's beach schools are running in Lettie and Lempuka this week and next.
Even when it rains and then gets hot, young swimmers are not a fad, says swimming school trainer Taina Itkonen.
This week's swimming classes will have 13 students, next week's will be 10.
The number of children affected by the week was that school and the school year were already beginning, Itkonen estimates.
The Imatra Beach School is organized in cooperation with the Movement Connects project and the city of Imatra.
Thursday night, the atmosphere was pleasant at the beach in Liette.
The sun was shining and the young swimming students were practicing to stay on the surface with the swimming puffins, someone already in the air.
The younger siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines of the Kaikkō, 5, first suspected that he was going deeper into the water.
Taina Iitkonen, however, encouraged him to push toward the shore.
You're doing great!
Iineskonen told me he went swimming a lot this summer.
The beach at the lake is good for him.
Iines, like Kaikkos, practiced swimming with the swimming pool with perseverance.
"You too can be satisfied with what you've accomplished today", the swimmer said.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to go to the water fountain.
Ilona Villberg, whose daughter Anna Villberg, 6, has been swimming from the beach, considers the beach school a good start for learning to swim.
Even though the weather has been what it is, Anna has always liked to come here.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming school kids are packing up on the pier.
The boys were sick of the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, sipped fruit and roasted the day.
The class continued on the water, but the dock was not in a hurry.
The kind that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes. "Here's a story that unites us".
You see all kinds of things.
Blue Product, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched their Unknown Soldier line a few days ago.
I mean, dish towels and laundry towels and "toilet brush with brush on the edge".
An unknown soldier is referring to a film and marketing campaign that will premiere this fall.
But there's something special about the combination, and the products have been teased on social media: When will the Unknown Health Bonds come?
I'm gonna have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does the VP of Blue Product say about the Silly Mouth?
We're partners in the film.
We're supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support a domestic production and a cult film, says Määttä.
He said that the products would be given a special promotion and that the film would gain exposure.
Isn't there something a little bit funny about this, often when you think that products and stories have something in common?
There is a unifying story here, that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, says Määttä.
According to him, the company is committed to the same Finnish values as those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is no stranger to military culture, too, as Mudd points out.
Other partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, Hartwall's wigs, known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been introduced.
The unknown products were already predicted by the Finnish Picture magazine blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are available.
Kinnunen points out that the premiere is still a long way off, so there's still a sequel.
The unknown partner has yet to disclose its war products, including Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, writes Kinnunen.
Results of new age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden published
The latest results of the Swedish medical age tests for asylum seekers have been published.The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age.However, not everyone believes the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Office started testing earlier this year.
The tests allow for a more accurate estimation of the age of the asylum seeker than previously, and were introduced after criticism of the Swedish Immigration Service for failing to determine the true age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests to date and the Forensic Office has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
In addition, the Forensic Office determined that in 25 cases the person being tested was 'possibly 18 years of age or older'.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is 'possibly under 18'.
Tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to doubt the age declared by the applicant.
Johan Göransson, from the Forensic Office, says the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
"The figures are pretty consistent, with no big differences from previous months", he told The Local.
Even if a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that the applicants lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that 442 of them had "indications that the person being investigated is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet analysed the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical method used in the tests to assess age is to take X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the kneecaps, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans, which can determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later than normal.
I have had reason to think about it and I do not think the method used is right.
Determining biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic science office, Göransson, defended the accuracy of the tests: In general, the risk of identifying a child as an adult is low.
The risk is greatest when the test subject is about to turn 18, when the risk is about 10%.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was just trying to get you to stop.
Five over par finishes in the third round saw Mikko Ilosen spend 30 quarters on the downhill in the European Tour of Golf competition in Scotland.
Ilonen started Saturday from 11th, but was found at the end of the round in 41st.
In a difficult situation, Ilos had one double bog with three bogs.
It was hard for everyone else.
Ian Poulter of England rose to share the top spot with a lap under par, even though he told us that the umbrella holders were a lot of work.
The necklace was rough, but I stuck with it and it ended up being a good day, Poulter inch.
He shares the top spot with fellow Australian Callum Shinkwin and Andrew Dott.
The governor of West Virginia is changing parties .
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at Trump's campaign rally that he was switching parties.
"The Democrats simply rejected me", Justice said.
Today, after much prayer and careful consideration, I can tell you that I will no longer be able to serve you as governor of West Virginia.
The crowd burst into a roar of applause.
"Tomorrow I will register as a member of the Republican Party", Justice added.
As coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game.
Trump has previously promised a major announcement at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and according to Forbes, he's the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining business and owns coal mines in five states.
His estate is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night saying that "Gov. Justice's change of party is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather build barriers than a better America".
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, and in this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message", RNC Representative Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Salam spread the damage from Thursday to even the driest day of summer
At the end of the week, more will be sent to southern Finland.
During the past week, it has been particularly strong in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of south-eastern Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning struck and set several fires.
The weatherman says Thursday could be the driest day of summer so far.
The sea cucumbers have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been reported, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of the south-west of Finland.
At the table, lightning struck the power center of the rowhouse, causing a small fire.
The fire was reported to the fire department at about 1:15 a.m. Wednesday.
The power station was in a sauna at the end of the row house.
The rescue team dug through the roof and walls to find the fireworks and quickly put out the fire.
Eleven apartments were left without electricity, but no injuries were reported.
In the swamp, lightning ignited the outer building on Harjulante before midnight.
When the fire department arrived, the building was already in full flames, and the fire department had no choice but to stop the fire from spreading.
A building measuring about 50 square feet burned to the ground.
In the direction of the ditch in Räkkylä, lightning struck the mansion again.
The occupants of the house were outside the building and witnessed the flashing lightning.
The rescue team came to the scene to check on the case, but this time the lightning did not cause the fire - only a few melting points caught fire.
In traffic, a lightning strike caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoen and Vaasa, when the lightning damaged the traffic control system.
The fault was reported between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, the railway has been able to continue as normal, even on the stretch of track that is run by the bulkhead.
Salamans have been wreaking havoc all over Finland.
However, the number of pests has been relatively low this summer.
These summer news stories have been a total bummer! notes Jari Tuovinen, a meteorologist at the Meteorological Institute.
Wednesday and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the slight summer lightning, many feel even stronger.
This may seem like a tough call, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's calls, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the farmhouse was racked 1,700 times, and Thursdays have the potential for even the hottest summer rainy day: by about 4 p.m. the farmhouse had 1,790 farmers.
If the lightning continues until the middle of the night, it could reach over 2,000, the Forester predicts.
The previous record low number of units was set in 2015, when the number of units for the year was around 30 000.
By Wednesday, this year's number had risen to 18,386.
So there is still work to be done to ensure that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
But I can expect my faith to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the weather over Finland remains warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favourable environment for the young.
By Saturday, the main focus of the thunder will shift from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 days of thunder can be received both on Saturday and Sunday.
The central parts of the country are in the process of being joined by a more uniform border.
That's the kind of thing that Toovinen says only a few people do.
Coe applauds Russia's "kindly" apology for the doping scandal
World sport boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an open apology by Russia over the doping scandal on Thursday, but added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban.
At the IAAF Congress on Thursday, the day before the World Cup, Russian General Director of Sport Dmitri Shlyahtin said that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he intended to fight against doping decisively.
He expressed his regret for all the athletes who had been deprived of gold or silver medals in competitions.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban, with Russia being banned from all sporting events in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency report presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
The whole Council and the Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian All-Sports Federation acknowledged that the country had been through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganise its activities.
Mr Coe also said he was "satisfied" that Russia had accepted the terms of the ban.
'I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working party's recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban,' said Coe.
We must do everything we can to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete in the neutral athlete status at the World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday, having met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
IAAF working group head Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has many requirements to meet before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate and the coaches who have been banned are still free to operate", he told reporters after a presentation at the IAAF Council in London on Friday.
Production company disappointed by Tom of Finland's poor success
The film Tom of Finland did not turn out to be as successful as the filmmakers had hoped, says Yle.
To be honest, I'm disappointed, admits the director of Helsinki Film, Annika Sucksdorff, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that's what it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fairly high audience of 100,000, a small amount compared with the film's budget of about five million euros.
It's not a lottery win, but it's important that investors get their money back.
If the movie had done better at home, they'd have gotten their money by now.
Now we have to expect small spills of overseas spread, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the use of money by European football associations do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France, making it the most expensive transfer in football history.
The possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are to be decided by UEFA, the European football governing body, which may prevent the teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the Financial Fair Play Rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid €222 million for the Brazilian deal, and Neymar's annual salary at the new club is in the tens of millions of dollars.
There are a number of economic aspects to Neymar's move to France.
PSG has no problem paying Neymar's transfer fee and joining the star guard, as it will finance the oil-rich ruling family of Qatar.
The Commission notes that the aid is not compatible with the internal market and that it is not compatible with the internal market.
The financial rules of the fair game were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, a Frenchman who was elected UEFA President in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by borrowing was a fraud and would lead to serious problems if the banks or the owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair play rules shifted from the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model, first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003, was significantly hampered by Abramovich buying a promising team, spending huge sums on player procurement and creating a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period for the fair play rules will run until 2018, during which the clubs will be allowed to make losses of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to resign as UEFA president in a scandalous fashion in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to curb the clubs' reckless spending.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future", Andrea Traverso, the UEFA's head of financial rules for fair play, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract in a lump sum, it can spread the amount in the books for the whole duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer fee can be booked at EUR 44,4 million per annum for the next five years.
The first penalties were imposed in 2014 under the Fair Play Financial Rules, with the biggest penalties being imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million, later reduced to €20 million, and ordered to limit their Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014/15 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenues through companies linked to the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not count the aid as actual income.
The Commission notes that the measures in question were not granted to the Qatari State.
It has also emerged that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be financed by fees available from the Qatar 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar is being made a World Cup ambassador, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
In the light of previous sanctions against PSG, UEFA is monitoring attempts to circumvent the rules more closely than usual.
Sources familiar with the situation told us on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG for Neymar's transfer.
The sources gave the interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identities not be revealed, as they do not have the authority to discuss the situation at PSG.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
The financial statements for the previous period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of follow-up products and jerseys.
The company estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, clearly angered by the departure of one of the world's best players, tried to make it more difficult for Neymar to move, claiming it violated the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear case of financial doping for both the club and the state", Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is also wary of the fact that the football club is financed by the state, which owns the American sports fund.
"This is the result of ownership, which has completely changed the way football has operated over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
Anything is possible once the state owns the football team.
It is extremely difficult to comply with the economic rules of fair play, because there are so many interests involved in having a famous player represent the state.
Now we have to hurry: coach of the Finnish World Cup athletes stuck in Helsinki
The long jumper Arttu Pajulahde and the triple jumper Kristina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching at the World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach's advice.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump tomorrow and Mäkelä in the triple jump on Saturday.
However, the coach of the twins, Ghazaryan, an Armenian, has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has been trying to take it to the British Embassy without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a document, but that too has not been valid for a visa.
"Is this the first sign of Brexit or what?" said coach Jorma Kemppainen.
He's always been successful in dealing with visa issues himself, but now there's some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't mean that much.
As long as someone in the stadium looks at the footprints in their direction, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about the possible absence.
World Cup medal for Finland, London is going to need a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will begin in London this Friday and will run until the end of the week on Sunday, August 13th.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are able to passionately pursue year after year, whether they succeed or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other meters.
Less noticeable are the beautiful back stories of young athletes from one prestigious event to another, where experience matures the athlete's performance to the level that an adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now the small Finnish World Cup team has no such young athletes, and certainly no winners.
The World Cup medal for Finland will require a miracle.
Fortunately, the fascination and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the edge of the television screen and glues them to the games, even though the medals in London are not decided until late at night because of the time difference.
At the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear-thrower, Tero Longkhakki.
The fans are still waiting for Long to win a medal, even though the other side is told by his and the other pitchers' recent results and Long's finishing in last summer's singles.
No matter how he went through these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes in competitions, qualifying for the final or setting their own record is a good enough achievement.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for the coming years of Finnish sport will be rewarded by good success in the international youth competitions this summer.
The development of young talent and the financial support for its work is more important than the maintenance of a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant but requires years of sweat from athletes and patience from coaches and bench players alike.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique achievements.
I hope the London race will go down in history as a race between Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of the terrorists or the poor people's attacks.
"But it hurts" by the Copper Big Air.
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has placed second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place finisher at Copper Mountain is the best in the Lake District Big Air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
The boat scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried his first ever 1080 in a race on his final jump, and it was very close to being a success.
I feel good and I'm having a good time, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go well.
I'm gonna try that again from now on in the races, inch Lake.
In big air snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jumpsuit designed for the sport.
The new Viking Line speedboat has docked in Helsinki
The new fast ship FSTR, shipping company Viking, is very late to the schedule.
The speedboat was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6:00.
The ship was loading at 8:00.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
I've been waiting for at least an hour and a half for you to get on the boat.
The traffic is now moving slightly, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting for a boat to enter the port of Helsinki, told the news agency at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane suspected that the new ship had a technical malfunction.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought on board the water bottles waiting in their cars.
Christa Grönlund, Viking's communications director, tells IS that there was a technical glitch in the ship.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will be delayed for a couple of hours on the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn and return to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
A 42-meter-high special transport is disrupting traffic on the Sixth Avenue Thursday night.
A 42-meter-long special transport will be moving from Muuk to the port of Mustaola on Thursday night.
The 9:00 transport should be here by 11:00 p.m.
Police control traffic on Sixth Avenue, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From the spot where the lightning hits, the shipment will continue along Route 13 to the Black Sea port.
The nostalgia of the small circle, Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective.
The story is a simultaneous glimpse into the glory days of the characters in the '80s and the grunge of the '90s (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing the brilliant sketch series The State for MTV) and into their own time in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the rest of the stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory that we've become stuck with in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have been around for a while.
First Day of Camp did surprisingly well, not just for its absurd humor (it was told, among other things, as the backstory for the vegetable basket spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors play the role of eager teenagers approaching adulthood, and the emphasis on that makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, stalker films of the 1990s, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters brings up the Apple Powerbook, inline skates, and "move stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in another crazy plot, Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) is an accomplice to the crime of George H. W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in this kind of show, the best part is the sideburns.
It's particularly interesting to see Paul Rudd, a teenager, with a beard patch under his lower lip, or the "soul patch" from Matt Dillon's "Singles", playing Andy Rudd, the camp shoe, who is becoming an old man.
The moments of random madness may take this series off the air as a sort of recurring Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer  Twenty Years Later.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the button-down style of GLOW, where East meets West.
The comedy series, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, is a Romanian adaptation of the 1980s police drama about a couple of Bucharest cops fighting for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with the latter two being voiced by Channing Tatum (the series' executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's not much else.
The series has some good visual jokes (police spend time watching chess on television the same way Americans watch football).
There's a bunch of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, and their bondage is a fun game.
Comrade Detective, however, is too caught up in the clumsy socialist drama of the show, with the killer hiding behind the Reagan mask, for example, which is why the series often feels like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the show is not fast enough or abundant enough.
In summary, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, even if Gregor and Iosef are frequent visitors to the American Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can turn everything into a commodity and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were hungry for our own recent history and theirs too.
Ton Tauru from Kouvala will take the stage in Macau on Saturday against a former UFC fighter .
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru is going to have a tough fight in Macau, because Leandro Issa from Brazil was fighting in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has a black belt in judo and the world championship in the sport.
For once, I'm going to fight myself.
It's a funny story, told by 32-year-old Tauru.
The Kouvola man was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were rushed to the Macao Autonomous Region of China.
Tauru has never faced such a thing before.
This is the first time my game's been canceled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
But the contestant is happy that the fight has been rescheduled.
Waiting a week doesn't do much to prepare.
The transplant won't make any difference to his condition, because he won't get better in a week.
It could get worse if you practice too much right now.
Tauru has faced opponents in his previous few fights whose strengths are in vertical combat.
This time it's different.
The guy from Cocoa describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's a rather aggressive fighter.
I'm betting he'll come in the first round and try to take me to the carpet.
He's won the world championship in judo, so he knows how to punch.
The last match Kouvolian had, it didn't go as planned.
Kevin Belingo of the Philippines hit Tauru hard in the corner of his eye, and the Philippines won.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up, he didn't get a hit.
When I went to the fall, he hit me in the corner of my eye.
It hurt for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the wrestlers fight once a year, some climb the ring more closely.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
And on the board, we had three fights last year.
Now, the second fight of the year.
Sometimes the pace gets rough.
I've been training for the last few years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the scene for a moment.
I was in Espoo, training, and I got the pleasure of doing it back.
We had a really good training session with this guy from Sweden.
The practice was a big help, since on Saturday the cowboy has to prepare for a physical fight.
I've been able to train against opponents of my own size and practice the vertical.
That's why fighting in the field is the 32-year-old's primary tactic.
You have to hit it with your head.
If I get a chance, I'll go and take you to the estate myself.
The lowest exports must not be given away for free, because they consume the most.
Macau is attracting Taurus, who had previously fought in China.
I hear it's the Chinese Las Vegas.
I believe you have a great, great night ahead of you.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25% .
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been flat and the easing of inflation has ended speculation about interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow, and it has postponed the rate hike as the pressure on household income increases.
The decision-makers of the Bank's monetary policy committee voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, a rate hike that has been less favourable this month as economic growth has been flat.
In its quarterly inflation analysis, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1,7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1,6%.It also warned that the level of household income would be under further pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank said that interest rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to curb Brexit-driven inflation and that borrowing costs might have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
The Commission also decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that was launched a year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide more than £15 million of low-cost financing to banks through the Scheme, for a total of £115 million.
The Bank's minutes of the interest rate decision state: "The Monetary Policy Committee forecasts that the slowdown in GDP will continue in the coming years, with the fall in real household incomes reducing consumption".
As regards interest rates, the Bank reiterated that the need to contain inflation would be to "simply tighten monetary policy" to "more broadly" meet market expectations.
The market currently forecasts a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases would be gradual and marginal.
In May, the Bank forecast growth of 1.9% for this year and 1.7% for next year.
It now maintained its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 dollars against the dollar and 0.4% to 1.11 euros against the euro.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken after the lower than expected growth rates dampened the increased expectations of interest rate increases, with GDP growing by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly towards the end of the year.
Its latest inflation assessment gave little hope for households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, with the Bank predicting that the situation will worsen before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the fall in income in the coming years, but that it expects wage developments to "recover significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will offset some of the effects of the fall in private consumption.
The decision came a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% following the shock EU referendum result, which sent the pound plummeting.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision on prices and the economy will probably not begin to be felt until four years later.
Before the latest decision by the ECB, demands for interest rate increases had become increasingly vocal as inflation increased the pressure on households.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but the Bank said it was expected and that inflation would tighten again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess of its 2% target was due to the weakness of the pound as a whole.
"Given the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to be tightening as lenders are looking to buy more customers and want to finish the year strong", says Andrew Montlake, president of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
The market is particularly favourable for those whose current loan agreement is about to expire, with renewal contracts becoming more popular, interest rates being lower and inexpensive alternatives available.
The NHS orders 10,000 people to take controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients can be prescribed a 'reversible' HIV medicine, after the Supreme Court decided a dispute over funding for the drug in England's public health service (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is being prescribed to around 10,000 people during the first three-year trial.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS could afford to pay for PrEP, despite the fact that it claims local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called Thursday's announcement a "significant new intervention" and the National AIDS Foundation described it as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting applications for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October and reach full scale in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medication taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
A pre-sex medication means that there are enough drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection during intercourse.
You can take it every day or two hours before sex.
Treatment target groups include gay men, bisexual men and transgender men, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics will select eligible applicants from men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and registered with their GP may also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and the NHS in England signed a contract this week to procure the drugs following an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, administration and treatment.
'This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the existing, diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV', says Stevens.
 Another significant achievement in the more than 30 years of struggle to solve one of humanity's greatest health challenges.
"This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV", says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Foundation.
 PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and to those at risk, could have a transformative impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, those at risk will be given a drug, through an NHS-funded trial, which they can decide on independently without having to consult a partner, and it will have a powerful impact that will improve the lives of many, many people.
This was welcome news.
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the trial is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is left out", says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
The PrEP drug used in the trial has been procured, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.
"The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event, which was delayed for months by government delays", says Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister.
We have evidence that the drug could be a game-changer in our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The trial will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.
Quality of life: a mid-rise and smart interior design have turned the small Earl's Court into a spacious home
In 2014, Joanne Leigh, a former banker, moved from her home in Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anne-era style house, and the success of the renovation is that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and moved yet.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge", Joanne tells us.
I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment show here and I noticed that the rooms were as high as the apartment I had.
I fell in love with him immediately and made him an offer the same day.
Since then, the approximately 300-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a double, with the bedroom only accessible from the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to take advantage of the furniture's height.
I wanted space, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands, he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from Duck & Shed, a design firm in Notting Hill, to take advantage of the space of the nearly four-metre-high rooms and create a flat that would not only be a repair and sale site but a home.
The height of the apartment was not quite enough for two overlapping rooms, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor to fit the two.
The solution required creative thinking on Erfan's part.
 Steel structures are rather complex.
The rooms had to be arranged in such a way that they were overlapped so that no one had to crawl in them.
The structures had to be modified to be of just the right height both above and below.
Erfan was able to place two full-sized rooms in the space, one on top of the other, with fascinating details.
The interstitial floor opens onto the elegant living room with a copper-glazed window by the Retrouvius.
The mirror-gold furniture, the silver fixtures and the vintage lamps of Serge Mouille create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings the theatrical feel, the feeling of space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short hallway make the hallway seem longer than it actually is.
The mirror in the kitchen's recess is like a window that opens onto another room.
The mirrored furniture in the front entrance has storage space for Joan's meals and glassware.
The kitchen's more stylish because it's a place to hide when you're not using it.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution.
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little planning", Erfan says of the steel-reinforced MDF door with a cold surface.
It is balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when lifted.
With reasonable space and storage planning, Joanne got 16 extra square feet, a second bedroom, and an even better foundation.
"When selling a house, the area is the key", says Erfan, "or the property's value".
In the main case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price on the basis of the area.
Joanne's apartment was expanded with high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The inhabitant is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the feeling for the dwelling is partly generated by them", says Erfan.
No one's attached to the wires that run through the walls.
They are also important, but not in the same way.
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good planning and additions can make a basic home exceptionally beautiful.
It may also be that you no longer want to move out.
Princess Sofia, pregnant, radiated in her summer dress.
Princess Sofia's dress was right.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For the dinner at the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a pink and blue dress.
Sofia was there, smiling.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has been visiting Båstad, Sweden, this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body suit, which beautifully dressed a late-term pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in dark blue.
This is the last representation event Sofia will be representing before she was born.
His due date is in September.
For the dinner of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that was beautifully placed.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel dress was a beautiful dress for the princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden, this week on a diplomatic mission.
Sofia completed her outfit with a small purse.
Sofia was literally radiant in her fresh summer dress.
Sofia was even eager to talk to the photographers.
"Now I'm just holding my stomach", Sofia said, laughing, and pointing to her final pregnancy.
He 's raising us with sweet chilli
In the summer of 1996, a house selling Thai food appeared in the marketplace of Lahti.
The Lakers didn't dare taste it, they just walked by.
In the cage, Panya Suamsri-Penti sold food, among the acquaintances of Panja.
He knew very little Finnish, and Finns at that time did not yet know Thai.
Since people didn't dare to go out to eat, Panja offered free spices.
This is how he taught the people of the Gulf to eat Thai food, spring by spring.
He said, "Taste the land".
I got caught in the hook.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai restaurant in the Lahti shopping mall.
There were two small tables, less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and you're confined, you can't leave an empty chair between you and a visitor.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at a plate with a dictionary, learning Thai.
Two years passed on the side of the mall, but then the restaurant had to move because they said the homemade seasonings smelled too much in the hall.
The mall's closing gave us a new seat.
There's room.
Now we lawyers can sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times do we have to be shy to ask strangers if there is room next door.
Panja knows her client.
They'll tell him who he belongs to, where he's been, who he's seen.
He knows what you eat.
He's seen the life stages of his customers change, the food society changes.
He'll remember the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me when I was thin and fat, and he remembers me when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my own place by the kitchen door and exchange belongings with Panja leaning against the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He's taught me about tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili steak.
He has opened not only our tastes but also our minds and hearts.
Today, many speak Thai to him - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been friendly.
He's a hard worker.
He's a mushroom and a blueberry when he's in the restaurant business.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating its two-decade anniversary.
We customers had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this momentous day passed, on the job.
A find from an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
The security authorities received a list of important elements for their counter-terrorism work at the beginning of the year.
The list contains the names of over 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 persons in all, and the document contains not only their personal details but also photographs of each one.
More than 130 of the persons listed are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also included.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
I've been told by Evening News about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi army special forces found a list of terrorist IDs and photos while searching the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence agencies evaluated the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious was being planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the persons, but also their date of birth, their invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also identifies terrorist special zones.
For example, the list of 27-year-old German Sami J. reads Abu Assid al-Almani, or German, as his combat name.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
Next to his picture is a special law suicide bomber.
We don't know anything more about the man's fate.
A total of some 6,000 fighters have left Europe for ISIS, with their fate uncertain.
A man has gone underground in the Tokynrann of Helsinki.
According to the interviews with the rescue service, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning soul.
A person was rescued from the water on Thursday in Helsinki's Tokopani.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire chief of the Helsinki Rescue Service, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the call.
A diver from the rescue team found him under the surface, Estlander said.
The rescue team got a call about the incident just after 4:30 this afternoon.
The person was admitted to the emergency room.
Estlander says it was a man in his 50s.
Interviews show that he wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation on Tokai Beach is over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Patrol and the police.
It was a mission run by the Border Patrol.
The locals also provided excellent guidance for the divers.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water, along with the Border Patrol and the police.
Two cars collided in Eurasia. Nine people were in the cars. Three seriously injured.
A firefighter who was a resident said that there were nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries.
The wounded include both men and women.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the afternoon.
The collision occurred when one car swerved in the warning triangle from behind in front of the other car, said a fellow fire chief.

The brothers are fighting over $ 500 million in real estate .
Two brothers are arguing over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million, a dispute involving a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Former Carlton Football Club president and property developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak estate just three houses from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute over the division of his estate and business property to the Supreme Court.
Paul has been wanting to leave the family business since 2014, but the divorce is a bitter controversy.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded to a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to the agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul about a third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns real estate worth approximately $316 million and Paul owns real estate worth approximately $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of property and money.
"I think Colin left the best real estate to himself in his proposal", Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday in the Supreme Court for the first time after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are also now arguing over who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of the business.
Colin says that's not true, and he's accusing Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
Colin writes in one of his first depositions that he would like to see the case resolved.
"In keeping with our Italian tradition, family is the most important thing to me", Colin said in his statement.
The cost of this case is constantly increasing, with hundreds of pages of conditional statements, emails, reports, and the case is being investigated by consulting firms like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, like Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who opened milk bars and sweets shops in the late 1950's. In the early 1970's, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of property in Collingwood, where Colin established the family's first jeans store.
Colin says that he started the shop in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons in a conciliatory way.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to end up in court", Anna writes in her statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group, and Colin said that Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "grumpy about their financial situation".
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former member of the Australian Football League board and a close friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul DeLutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and he texted me saying that he couldn't really comment on the matter because it's going to court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and take our family's name to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to fight like this", Colin continued, telling us that he still hoped that the matter would be resolved.
By Friday, it seemed like all hope was gone.
"Our case will be decided in court in the near future", Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is going to restrict the president's access to the media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First of all.
According to Poltico, the White House's new chief of staff is planning to restrict President Trump's access to the media and news to keep the boss from getting into trouble so often.
This is Josh Dawsey reporting:
When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior management on his first day in office, he spoke about the central problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told the White House staff that all information, whether it's printed or in press conferences, must be passed through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's access to the media and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If Trump was upset about unfair coverage, he needed to show that the sympathetic media was more even-handed", Sam Nunberg, an adviser to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "a former campaign worker of six said that it is essential for Trump to control his use of Twitter that his personal media flow includes a steady flow of praise".
- I got it.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't. Maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more brutal without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff have been able to stop him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has been able to consistently stop Trump from causing a riot.
Part of the problem is that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to push their case by giving Trump information that supports their views, which may or may not be credible.
In May, Politico reported that advisers were deliberately giving the president questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on one case:
Trump's current and former employees say he can get extremely angry at newspapers that criticize him  especially if they report damaging leaks.
This is what happened in late February, when someone sneakily gave the president a copy of a news story on GotNews.com, a website founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of multiple White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later retracted them, and had not provided any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun asking the staff about Walsh after reading the story.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a system of handling documents going to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll prove more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his aides are still running their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission extremely difficult.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract with PSG.
Brazil's star player Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, AFP reports.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a Spanish football club, a €222 million buy-out.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to move to Paris-based PSG.
The transfer of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, who paid €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The association is chaired by former Qatari tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi.
It is believed that Neymar will arrive in Paris on Friday.
Successful author Raija Oranen covered up alcoholism and flying by hypnosis: "I'm fine with my life"
The best-selling author of the TV series The Time of the Rose and Pure White Sheets, Raija Oranen, has just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Your hypnosis helped Rai from Ora.
The five children love Grandma so much that she and her husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring, they're moving out of the rental.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, from which he has recovered.
The outer being is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight started to drop when the serotonin pills were stopped, they were mood pills.
I was able to get help for my alcoholism with hypnosis, which also helped me with my flight fever, and I won it.
I've been sober for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a man, a brilliant writer says so candidly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I'm feeling better than I've ever felt.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been traveling together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was two weeks to get married, and Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughing at his wife.
Oranen, who has had a long career as a writer, remembers only fondly the 44-part series Pure White Sheets, which touched and moved Finland during the Depression.
I decided to turn the Raika family business into a clothing business when I read the 50-year-old interview with Alice Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress, my mother also had a clothing store, and I sometimes worked as a model, Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelaine's research and the claim revealed it, says Oranen.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many scripts under work - ideas hundreds.
The tourists returned over the moat to the Avenue of Millionaires.
The richest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in a fight with the persistent vagrants who managed to get over the moat the town was digging and back to the fields next to the houses.
Tourists park their 20s of caravans near what is called Millionaires' Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the city's barrier, bringing with them children, horses, and an army of vans.
The tourists managed to cross a roadblock that had been left unprotected by the path.
Angry residents have accused the municipality of "complete failure to solve the problem".
A resident, who declined to be named, said the tourists arrived Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had been throwing rocks at passersby.
The municipality must act with all its might because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourists were here in May, then they left but came back again.
More came in last night and probably more today.
The resident said that the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay the city tax when the city can't do anything about it.
Another resident, who declined to be named, said it was ridiculous that the tourists returned so soon after being driven away.
"They are more numerous than ever, and they have even let their horses graze in the park".
A spokesman for the City of Solihull said the city is aware of an illegal camping site near Streetsbrook Road and is working with Solihull Police to take the necessary legal action to evict the camping people as soon as possible.
It is of the utmost importance for the collection of evidence that as many local people as possible report disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for the trial.
Angry people surrounded the Portuguese destroyer
In Portugal, the men who made the forced landing on a crowded beach were questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday in a crash.
The two men who flew the plane could face charges of capital murder.
The maximum penalty in Portugal is 16 years in prison.
The small plane they were piloting had to make a forced landing yesterday on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, because of a technical malfunction.
At the time of the incident, hundreds of people were on the beach, some of whom ran to the water in a landing plane.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl on landing, killing them instantly.
The plane hit the man who was backing the plane first.
Immediately after that, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, told the Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the accident, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating it up, said witness Celia Rocha in Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a wonder more people didn't die.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star tragically lost his leg won another World Cup gold: "Without the accident I wouldn't be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning the World Cup gold medal in the slalom at the Big White in Canada.
The Great Hammer also won the World Cross Country Gold Medal in the previous edition.
In all, three World Cups have been won.
It's been a hell of a World Cup.
Two times the gold was dealt, the pulse was pretty good, the Big Hammer was happy to be reached by telephone.
The 30-year-old thanked his coach and the successful preparation in Finland.
The Big Hammer says the number of challengers in the race is growing steadily.
The whole paraloon board game has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The gaps are narrowing, and there are a lot of new calculators.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming after him.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Big Hammer lost his other leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been an avid climber since he was a young boy with his friends, and the accident did not take away his desire to climb the slope.
I wonder, from time to time, what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been, "There's no point in sitting around".
The cards are played according to what has been dealt, the Great Hammer emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a lucky stroke, and the Big Hammer doesn't.
But he turned the ugly difficulty into a good thing.
I'd say it turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without the accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Big Hammer's greatest dashing passion was already fading.
The Duun's journey to the top didn't really take off until after the accident.
I trained with the guys when I was younger, and we were always excited to beat the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself at the start of the X-Games.
I never would have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I was thinking, "This is gonna be a really long life if I stay here and be bitter and mournful".
I decided to put on my scarves and get to work.
I'd say I've been doing pretty well.
The accountant was very pleased that the wheelchair user Leo-Pekka Star was chosen as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at a sports event in January.
The Big Hammer says that Star's victory is an important signal to the para-athletic community.
It was a big deal, and it was definitely a deserved win.
I'm sure this will also open up the world of para-athletics.
When is it time to launch the two-time world champion Matt Big Hamar's Sportsman of the Year campaign?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying my best to succeed.
The Great Hammer has not yet conquered all the peaks it has longed for.
Next year, I'm going to set a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be in South Korea.
We're going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.

The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that need to happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing about change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller communication agency surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international survey.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey was conducted in February-March 2017 with a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24 years, half of whom are women and half of whom are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
The survey found that more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return permanently to their homeland in the future.
42% of respondents may be thinking of returning to their home country and 4% could not say.
The study found that the war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country are the biggest factors influencing young people's decision to return home.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor in a permanent return to their homeland, while a quarter consider the departure of ISIS to be the most important.
Only less than a tenth of them cite the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the main factors influencing their decision.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked what was the most important factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority of the population believes that ending the war is more important than President Bashar al-Assad's resignation.
A fair quarter of the population considers the presidency of Assad an obstacle to a peace agreement.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a fair quarter believe in a military solution to the conflict.
A majority of Syrian refugee youths see ISIS's power weakened over the past year, while a fifth see it strengthened.
The respondents said that the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many chose military measures and educational reform as the primary means.
A fair tenth of the population thinks that the most important thing is to create better-paying jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change under Trump.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has ameliorated or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the Internet organized - using his database, Wikipedia and Google, for example.
MariaDB, a company based in Espoo, is developing the "fastest growing" open source database in the world.
MariaDB's flagship product, founded by the entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs nothing to users and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
Databases keep vast amounts of information organized and readily available.
If you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, they're going to use MariaDB or MySQL.
"All information that is not in the form of images comes from the database, and the images are linked to it", explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the head of technology at MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
A handsome man who works remotely helps to keep the Internet running smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, with David Axmark of Sweden.
In 2008, the tech company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, the software giant Oracle bought Sun for 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle deal happened, a lot of the MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which didn't give a firm promise for the future of MySQL", Widenius recalls.
By this time, he had already founded a company that began developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired Sun's top 20 developers and made sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch from it.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of MariaDB's code development.
"In the days of MySQL, these checks were not done", Widenius complains.
While many people have heard of Widenius and the billion dollar MySQL deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Our growth rate has been about 50% a year for the last few years", says Kenneth Paqvalén, MariaDB's chief financial officer.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet profitable, and Paqvalén is not very knowledgeable about the company's code numbers.
In addition, he reveals that MariaDB expects to receive orders of EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which corporate customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps with the replacement of databases, which can be over a year if the customer has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in a second, because they're versions of each other.
Amongst others, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud, all offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically deployed to new users in Linux operating system packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small firm, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our clients include the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks, and even several central banks", Paqvale lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Even Oracle MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, according to research firm Gartner, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing, in terms of turnover.
In a database market of about 50 billion dollars, open source databases are not even a billion.
However, the value of open source cannot be measured in money alone, since most users pay nothing for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018, enterprises will already be developing over 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
Moreover, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open data at that time, or at least the transition would have begun.
Big companies can't get new customers because most of them go for open source next.
This has led to a skyrocketing of licensing fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they did before with fewer customers", Widenius reflects.
Since switching from a closed database is a hassle, most of the client companies have eagerly embraced price increases.
"There are a lot of customers who are really hard to move to because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database", Widenius says.
But he still believes the customer base is filling up.
As licensing fees increase each year, sooner or later the customer will move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous price and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes.
Many companies are also facing major systemic changes when they move their operations to the cloud.
At the same time, many people are switching their database software.
Last spring MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
This was the largest EIB growth financing ever to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more now.
One reason for the EIB's funding was MariaDB's influence in public IT procurement.
The company has public sector clients in countries such as the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe spends billions of euros every year on databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use taxpayers' money more efficiently", says Paqvalén.
Mr Widenius is concerned about the way in which money is spent in Finland on, say, closed health care systems, whereas open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to code.
The community helps and does things that they can't invent or do themselves.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most well-known open source promoters, alongside another Finnish Linux developer, Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models based on open source.
I still give four or five lectures a year around the world on this topic.
Italy toughened its stance on NGO rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees on board vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue their activities", said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa.
The minute warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German charity Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of collaborating with human traffickers in facilitating illegal immigration.
The charity, which has been in operation for only a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges brought by prosecutor Ambrogio Cartoso.
"Saving lives is and will be our priority, and we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue area at this time", the organization said in a statement posted on social media.
'We can only assess the charges once we have gathered all the necessary information and can assess the situation.'
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the vessel Iuventa of the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking refugees on board by boatloads directly from smugglers, who re-used the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometres off the Libyan coast, according to a prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coastguard, which oversees the rescue efforts in the area, and the motive is said to be a desire to help.
The operational guidelines state that vessels such as the Iuventas must be accompanied by Italian police to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the guidelines: Save the Children and MOAS in Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain,
The European Commission, which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not "significantly change or impede" the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to follow the guidelines is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the EU's financial statements and the lack of transparency in the EU's financial statements.
"In the last few days, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He said that the EU was not prepared to accept the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment, but that it was prepared to accept the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
Suspected of killing his partner in the Enon crime, suspect found in the countryside, case to prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Enontekiö Kuttas last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish stepdaughter.
Earlier, it was reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect fled with two dogs into the countryside after the incident.
The man was found frozen in the countryside, and he did not resist being caught.
The case must be dismissed within a week.
The case may be argued in Lapland District Court as early as August.
Robert Hardy, best known for his Harry Potter and the Cursed Child series, has died.
The British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also acted in films and on television.
Hardy is best remembered for his role as the Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and as the veterinarian in the television series My All-Furry Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The popular BBC series was filmed on seven different channels.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for suicide-promoting text messages.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texts and phone calls she allegedly made to her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken", Conrad's father said at Thursday's hearing.
My son was my best friend.
Carter appealed the verdict and was allowed to await his appeal in the open.
He faced a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health issues.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored sweater, Carter was listening to his sentence, hands crossed, eyes downcast in tears.
"His actions killed Conrad Royn", the prosecutor told the court.
He took Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act, the prosecutor continued.
He has shown no remorse.
Carter's lawyer said the incident was caused by "conclusive circumstances" that Carter deeply regrets.
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's age, maturity, and even mental health problems had no significant influence on his actions.
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said that not a day would pass without me mourning the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I'm coping with all of this, and I'm going to try my best to comfort her sisters in this pain that we will always carry.
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she was "haunted" by the thought of never seeing her brother's wedding or being an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never goes away", Camdy said.
This case seems to be setting a precedent, since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that makes it a crime to incite suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in his car from cage poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter had been texting her boyfriend to encourage him to commit suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways", Carter wrote in the many messages he had sent Roy in the two weeks before his death, when Roy was on vacation with his family.
Just before Roy committed suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad", and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter was trying to get attention with Roy's death, and the judge ruled that Carter could not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts.
Few have defended Carter, and one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an op-ed by Knox, in which she stated: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison".
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it is safe to say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg told CNN in an interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek closer cooperation with Russia.
But particularly since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Mr Stoltenberg said that NATO was still committed to preventing tensions from escalating to a peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had noted that the US-Russia relationship had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump urged congress to thank the countries for their poor relations, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines in response to the backlash from car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced the new BMW, BMW offered to update the software of over 350,000 cars.
The BMW CEO said the company believed that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would make changes to the engines of more than three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies mentioned a recall.
European car manufacturers have been strongly promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet their CO2 emissions targets.
Diesel engine emissions of nitrogen oxides are thought to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission-neutralizing devices is rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are under intense scrutiny, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of helping the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, who installed cheating devices in their cars, which reduced emissions in the test, in accordance with the regulations, and in normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but the actions of executives are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he could be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, which authorities suspected had installed a system to circumvent European emission standards, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The audit could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
The vote in Venezuela has been investigated as fraudulent, with large protests on the horizon
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the actual number of voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election outcome, national election commission chairman Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro assures the crisis will end
A controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday elected a parliament to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organised demonstrations against its modification.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its own protests so that they would be ongoing at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night local time.
The troops are supposed to ensure the safety of the naming ceremony.
Climate change is threatening the avalanches of Provence
The lavender plant has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender had been reduced by drought and disease-carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are desperately trying to find a solution.
'The lavender is particularly threatened in the Provence region, which has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change, which has led to a significant reduction in spring and, in particular, autumn rainfall', says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence, which specialises in agriculture.
This will shorten the life of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought many small snails that spread micro-organisms.
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil is a tourist attraction and a highly desirable ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of the long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are underdeveloped or weakened or absent", says Chaisse.
In other words, the number of components containing essential oils is decreasing.
The solution is to improve irrigation, slow soil moisture loss, spray the plants with a protective clay-water mixture and develop drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist reflects the growing threat in Mexico .
The weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper deals with the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities and the endless drug war in Sinaloa state.
But today we're talking about security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them with them to a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
The security experts have written three words on the board in front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They're asking reporters for names for each group, no evidence is needed, observations and feelings are enough.
The board is inscribed with the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make the chaos in Mexico a life-threatening news story.
The violence is unrelenting and journalists are increasingly targeted.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.The federal government has 589 journalists under protection who have been attacked and threatened.This year, at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victim is Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and inspiration of RioDose.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books about drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is everywhere. The facade of the Riodose building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing his middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". Thirty-something journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts adorned by Valdez's smiling face. Valdez wears glasses and a trademark panama hat.
The meeting, which takes place less than two months after Valdez's death, will feature reporters discussing their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established specifically to handle journalists' cases, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two charges have been brought so far.
Journalist killers rarely end up in court, as do the thousands of murders per year involving drug trafficking and organized crime.
Riodose journalists intend to continue reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is becoming more dangerous.
Ibarra says the security conference is of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is a waste of time", he says.
"We can't trust anyone until we know what's happening".
Valdez had left the Riodoc office in the state capital of Culiacán on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had been driving a red Toyota for only a couple of blocks when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car, firing twelve shots, presumably in reference to the magazine's name, Riodoce, which means "Twelve Rivers".
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50.
He was mourned by his wife and two grown children.
Rumors are moving fast and are freely circulating in Culiacan.
But the death of Valdez is a matter of silence.
Sinaloa has been the bloodiest battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January, with rival groups trying to fill the void.
One or more people are shot to death every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery has two-story, ornate tombs of drug lords that are larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, there is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls the ports and drug routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his job, the founder and CEO of Riodose, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that is waging war against the Guzman boys.
The case may have angered Guzmán's sons: Suspected gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it went on sale.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career in Norway when he decided to start Riodose in 2003 with five colleagues, and the magazine's shares were sold for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem, Bojorquez said.
In time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the paper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in following the Mexican drug trade story with impunity.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
'I want to be able to move on with my life,' he said when he received the Committee to Protect Journalists' award.
"The drug trade is a way of life in Sinaloa", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
 A reporter must accept a task that falls to him  or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when they were bathing deaths here. Why didn't I tell you what was going on?
The staff of Riodose need Valdez, the joker who cursed like a dockworker, they need a friend who always gave them hugs and advice, they need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the bar across the street from the El Guayabo, and he always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routine was his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how best to do their job and survive.
Criminals don't like it when we cover their wives and children and their clean business, their secret drug-running highways.
They were left out of the case, Bojorquez says.
It meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-protection.
trusting your instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you should stay away.
The problem, according to Andres Villarreal, a journalist for Rio, is that "impressions can be deceiving, and that's what happened with Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt officials.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed in the room where the Rio de Janeiro security training was being held, because a few days earlier it had been revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had taken shelter in the shade of a tree in a 40-degree heat.
They were assigned by the state government to guard the offices of Riodose, a four-story building in the middle-class area of Culiacan.
Some reporters were playing a game of guesswork as to whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent whom the governor of the state did not consider trustworthy.
It had been months since the reporters had visited the drug-run mountainous countryside.
This week's issue of Riodose's paper had three main stories.
The brother of boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
Also, in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor's office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in town knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered to a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at every level for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to report on previous incidents in the same location, one of which was when the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would be getting reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez's column.
"We would have known what had happened", says 46-year-old Villarreal, nicknamed "El Flaco", or The Thorn, because of his slim build.
All connections to our sources are now disconnected.
The Valdez workshop has been converted into a warehouse for the storage of signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists, and the newspaper's staff has been given a new, unexpected task: to become activists for press freedom.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took some signs with her when she left the next morning for a protest outside the local prosecutor's office, which was triggered by another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, which, according to the DNA tests done by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly across the country, with "SOS Press" signs appearing on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to get international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
He has since asked to be moved out of government affairs, because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organized crime, the authorities allowing crime, and a disinterested society.
In his latest book, Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that while journalists are killed by drug gangs, they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in collusion with organized crime.
According to the Article 19 Monitoring Group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing", says Ramirez.
Murder is a crippling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
By his body was a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my writing".
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to shut down, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a front page message to the drug cartels: What do you want from us?
Some of the reporters have fled their states, or even the country.
It's a hard decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard at all times.
Sometimes criminals seek out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015, three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who keep working, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is going to hell", he says.
Some time ago, Riodose reporters were sitting on a sidewalk beer stand at midnight on a Friday when the latest issue of the magazine was finished, and suddenly their phones started ringing for a message.
In a shootout between rival gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort, 19 people were killed.
The war escalated, as promised in cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the story on the website of Riodot from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page was supposed to be re-posted the next day.
Sirens were sounding nearby. Another shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery.
If they were scared, they covered it up very well.
The Riodose delivery continued the legacy of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait of a man pointing his middle finger at the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider closing the magazine.  How could I close the magazine when our intern asked to go out on the street to do a story on the same day that Javier was murdered?
The Olympic project of Hannu Mannini began with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, the celebration of Hannu Mannis' 39th birthday was cut short as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began disastrously when Manning fell ill with a cold.
That began a long illness that lasted nearly five weeks.
May was practically all sick.
First there was the flu, and then a childhood illness like otitis, for which I had to take antibiotic therapy.
I was only able to do ten percent of the exercises I was planning.
I can't remember the last time I was sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn't get to take advantage of the practice, Manninen tells Evening News.
The test results are off .
The 2007 world champion was not allowed to train until the second week of June, as was shown by the KIHU roller-skating test conducted on 12 June by the Competition and Extreme Sports Research Centre.
The test involves the athlete skiing on a roller-skating mat, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall, I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but this time I only stayed 28 minutes.
It was a fire against the wall. Manninen tells me.
To the right
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he's kept his health.
I have done a variety of gentle aerobic exercises in an effort to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now, we're back to a really good five-week period.
The holiday also included a week and a half off from the plane crash.
I also had time to visit the cabin with my family.
Last season, Manninen only played in four World Cups before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately at the opening competition, when Manninen came in 18th in the top-scoring event.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that runs until next February.
We're gonna try to get a different rhythm to practice than we did last season.
After the first round, Ruk would have three World Cup weekends.
In December, the plan is to be in at least one World Cup weekend, maybe in Ramsau.
By the end of January, the plan was to be back in Seefeld.
I hope after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list, says Manninen.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics of Mann's career.
The key now is to stay healthy, underlines the Numean who celebrated gold in the 2002 team event in Salt Lake City.
The dinosaur protected itself from its enemies by disguising itself.
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have unveiled the first results of a Canadian miner's discovery of a creature the size of a rhinoceros that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that researchers were even able to determine that its finer skin was reddish and had had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best of its kind in the world.
The most recent fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cenozoic, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic magazine, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He struck something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his find more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
There, they dug the beast out of a 1,100-pound block for six years.
The fruits of hard work are now in sight.
"If you close your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep", says science writer Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Studies of the skin revealed that the carnivorous dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this herbivore, even though it had armor that resembled a walking armored car.
Its red-and-white armor disguised it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker colouration above and a lighter colouration below, which is still present in many animals.
Experts say this allowed it to better blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Researchers have named it Borealopelta after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours digging up the dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has been so amazingly well preserved that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body fins and armor.
They found that it was still protected by the coloration common in the animal kingdom, with the body darker on top and lighter on the bottom.
The discovery was surprising, though, because the Borealopel is considerably larger than the modern animals with the same coloration.
It may be concluded that the flesh-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding rather than fighting as a means of survival.
Modern animals, such as deer, zebras, and armadillos, have a similar coloration, are much smaller and therefore easier to prey on, suggesting that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The large, heavily armored dinosaur's armor shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Age of Enlightenment were", says Brown.
Chemical analysis of the nodosaur's organic compounds reveals that its skin was reddish.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus to draw conclusions about its life, including examining its intestinal contents to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Researchers believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was as warm as Florida is today, and the rivers and seas likely extended farther than they do today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because its finely-shaped skin has been preserved and it has also been preserved in three-dimensional form in its original form", Brown says.
So it looks almost the same as it did in the early interbreeding period.
It does not require much imagination to see it: if you blink a little, you can almost believe that it was asleep.
The Migration Age was the age of the theropods, the giant two-legged, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, existed millions of years before Borealopel, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The ancestors of Tyrannosaurus rex included the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 35 feet [11.5 m] long.
The latest findings from the Nodosaurus team, published in the journal Current Biology, suggest that Borealopel washed up in the sea after her death and mummified in the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with skins and armor from tail to thigh.
The nodosaurs averaged five meters in length and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Two and a half centimeters of spikes rose from their scales.
Researchers believe that this armored herbivore traveled through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river carried it out to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved in minute detail in an underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains are so well preserved that its skin is still left in the plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine that such preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more closely you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The hollow plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized skin.
Its right foreleg is on its side, five toes up.
I can count the folds of his foot.
How did one activist learn to answer the question, Whose are the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis, and he was sitting on the bed of his Airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
Police just killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still lying in the street.
He was confused, noticing that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline was followed by numerous retweets from user @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a St. Louis-based rapper who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable", thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, it was saying that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police bands and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, carrying a sign that read: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell was watching a real-time video of a police officer standing in front of the protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another cop pointing his rifle and yelling, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals".
"This is not normal", Ferrell remembers saying.
It wasn't the kind of murder we're used to, which you might call typical.
I felt the cold colors.
I was angry and I cried.
He booked a flight home the next day.
The plane landed at 11 p.m. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they were leaving for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years has been made into the documentary film Whose Streets? which premiered in theaters on August 11, 2017.
It's a story of survival and expression, of love and loss, and of strength and resilience from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to seek answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with his daughter in a flower dress and a matching crown, they resumed their conversation about what it was like to live as a black man and what conditions were like, which they had discussed countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for what they believe in?" Ferrell remembers telling his daughter.
We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it's not right.
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me", Ferrell later told me.
What happened today is the culmination of what happened in the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and grow up with it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black person, and he needs to know what we need to do to be free, to free ourselves.
Although I've been fortunate enough to protect her from blatant racism, she's just like any other black girl.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality.
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, across from the police station, which became a campsite for activists as they waited for information on the case and finally learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who was making lunch packs.
They packed lunch bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism completely changed after 9/11, " she says, " when she was a student at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, where Ferrell was president of the minority nursing student association, she focused on food rights and health disparities in black communities.
I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened.
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the assistant director of the documentary, at a late-night protest.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to tell what was happening.
Ferrell was suspicious, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times when people, usually white, had come into the local community, seeking to profit from its hardships and resilience.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have a common voice", Folayan said in a recent interview.
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism on death row.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other local filmmakers, who followed the events of Brown's shooting in the years that followed.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we do", Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how the local people are portrayed in the film, because I am portrayed in the same way".
Folayan said the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, as it was to show that the popular movement is not about a charismatic leader but about the community.
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked", Ferrell laughs as he tells us what it was like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human portrayal of black people requires a certain vulnerability".
And also Ferrell's story, which re-focuses and re-focuses the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media after the police shot dead a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in 2012, and two of the three founders identify as queer.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the movement going", says Ferrell. "It's because we're constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black queer women have been through it all.
Folayan agrees: The movement is really run by black women, who have a lot of queer women.
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary 'purposely' because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy going", says Folayan.
Black queer women are living on the cutting edge of a lot of things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted through the white matter.
The news crew has long since left Ferguson, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrelli has two and a half years left on his probation, and he was convicted of blocking the highway during a protest.
His description of the socio-political atmosphere in his home town is brief and concise: Mosaotku.
Yet he still relies on a slogan he learned by heart on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
We have a duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.
A matching likeness: an artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning 's DNA .
At the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are faces hanging in the center of the exhibition space  white, black, and brown faces, with a closer look at the similarities.
These 30 pieces are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent the samples from Fort Leavenworth, where he served his 35-year sentence, after being convicted of leaking classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
The Dewey-Hagborg exhibition A Becoming Resemblance was opened on 2 August 2017.
It's based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning, who combines technology, computer science and art in their work, Manning, a transgender pioneer dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the last day of his third term.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly identified with women since the age of fourteen, and was convicted in 2013 of 20 felonies, including violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning in prison: a stark, black-and-white selfie of Manning, feeling uncomfortable, sitting in the driver's seat of a car, wearing a platinum-white wig that became his trademark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a highly successful Stranger Visions project back in 2015, which he completed in 2012.
He used forensic data to create portraits, and he obtained DNA data from cigarette butts and chewing gum, and he created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a photo for their story", Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference about the new exhibition.
Manning couldn't be seen, and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in doing a DNA scan of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondents, and they corresponded for a couple of years.
They even made a comic book together called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, about a future where the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and she would get to see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama commuted Manning's sentence just days after the comic book was published, a lucky coincidence after seven years of hard labor in a federal military prison.
It's also impressive that the exhibition opens right now, with Donald Trump waging his own war on leakers and transgendered soldiers, and finding new ways to reinforce the powerful divisions he was actually supposed to mitigate on Twitter.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose".
The artist's statement is displayed on the wall below which is Manning's large signature, with the i of his last name as the heart, in which the artist calls for an end to the 'automatic division' on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based.
On the opposite wall is the Manning DNA sequence, a long string of C, G and A written in pencil.
This 200-letter , or nucleotide, as the artist uses the scientific definition, is , a combination Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
'I hope my exhibition will help people to understand that we are all equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation', says Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells countless stories, and here are 30 of them.
The last work of the exhibition is in his room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
That's Manning's character rising out of prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can shut you up, they've won", says the picture.
Never shut up.
The text is from a letter I received from Manning, an artist from Philadelphia.
It's so impressive, I still get cold feet.
Contrary to what the comic book described, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition, and when Manning arrives, he is greeted by faces based on his own genetic information, like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It's intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring the feeling of a crowd to them", says Dewey-Hagborg.
I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea had created, which was also behind her release.
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted on suspicion of murder.
Police say they've launched a nationwide search for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury condo.
Cook County court records show that on Monday, warrants were issued for the arrest of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea, on charges of first-degree murder without possibility of parole.
According to the records, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a local news release from the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police responding to a call at the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple lacerations on his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a homicide.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mailed statement, Alan K. Cubbage, vice provost for public affairs at the university, stated that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to the Northwestern campus.
"This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorities and Northwestern University is assisting in the investigation", Cubbage wrote.
Warren is a senior financial advisor at Oxford University.
A statement sent by email from a spokesman for the university and Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and stand ready to assist the investigating authorities in the US in any way possible".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were "shocked" and "hopefully" that he would surrender.
Chicago Police Department communications director Anthony Guglielmi said he would urge the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have a clue as to where they are and we are continuing to refine our search", Google said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities are helping in the search for the suspects.
He told police that he had received a call from the landlord of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened at apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as "horrific".
Guglielm says it's unclear if the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said the security cameras showed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship", Google said.
The Grand Plaza management group issued the following statement to residents: "Police are investigating the course of events and the background of the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence".
Man threatened to blow up Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic", the convict told the police.
Moffatt will be required to perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of one count of aggravated assault.
Police say the bookstore staff alerted them to the scene on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims".
Suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to the events at the bookstore.
Authorities noticed that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore incidents, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told the police during interrogation.
As punishment, the man will do 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay £620 (about $690) in legal fees and £85 (about $95) in compensation to the victims.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said that a number of hate crimes are not reported.
We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions under the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
Some of the measures in the roadmap have already been implemented and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Agency.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, Mutko said Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the return of the powers of RUSADA, the second part of which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mucko, there's nothing to worry about for Russia.
Everything has been announced, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future", added Mutko.
However, one of the points on the roadmap requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the WADA-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the alleged role of the state in doping in Russian sport.
Mr Mutko said: 'The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programmes, and we cannot grant what did not exist.
Mutko's words echoed the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, the chairman of the independent Russian Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Earlier in the day, Smirnov, speaking to the Russian sports media RSport, admitted that there have been problems with the Russian anti-doping authorities.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, but he added.
In November 2015, WADA ordered RUSADA to cease doping controls in Russia after the scope of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, in June last year it was granted the right to plan and coordinate the test under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited WADA's headquarters in Moscow in July, and after the visit he stated that the organisation was 'on the right track' towards the return of powers.
British organisation sceptical about Finnish innovation: "no evidence" of health benefits of maternity packages
A British organization is skeptical of the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian, for example, report that the Lullaby Trust, an organization that fights against concealed deaths, is banning its own flyers from being used in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in certain areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of stillbirth.
The death of a baby in a crib is an unexplained sudden death.
The Lullaby Trust is the UK's health authority's expert on the subject of a child's safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official leaflets to be wrapped in them, as that would imply that we recommend this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different factors, including the low rate of teenage pregnancy.
The fact that each family is given a box may be one factor.
But that cannot be said with certainty, said Francine Bates, the CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as a product that reduces infant mortality and stillbirth.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package contains various supplies, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the pack.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which a child can be put to sleep.
The Scottish Government says the boxes they've distributed meet all security standards.
The Lullaby Trust, for its part, says there is no safety standard for sleeping in cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, a packaging bed may be the best option for sleeping if a frame or a bunk bed is not available.
The Agency recommends that the pack should only be used for daytime sleep and should be discontinued when the child is able to turn.
It also recommends keeping pets away from packaging and ensuring that it is not wet or dirty.
The cowardly bastard escaped from the Japanese zoo again
Japanese zoo staff are searching for a runaway turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the crew with its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
A turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras showed the scumbag leaving the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very concerned", said Yoshimi Yamane, a zoo worker.
The fugitive, a 35-year-old male, weighs 55 kg and is about three feet tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the open hours, the animal is allowed to roam freely in the area of the nursery.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of the turtle.
The last time the team escaped was two weeks ago.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along the road 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid the mistakes Uber made.
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious.
'The surveys were simply not consistent and objective', says Errett. 'As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce.
Errett decided to seek outside help.
There are a growing number of new HR startups that are helping other companies to find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement, and can conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and demographic groups, and provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact through senior management to the board.
"You can track your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where does corporate Fitbit stand?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Redwood City-based startup Glint, which provides analytics software to companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The software allows quick surveys and votes for specific teams, and it can create a map that shows at a glance which departments are the most dissatisfied with employees and which managers have received the lowest ratings, which has allowed Errett to drill down to the root of the problems.
Companies have realized that they need to adopt a workplace culture if they are not to become the next Uber, and the ride-hailing company has been in the spotlight ever since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, these kinds of neglect are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry that could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior, gained interest earlier this year after Uber's reputation suffered a collapse.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It recently made a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent enables businesses to create customized surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if there's any reason to suspect the CEO of impropriety, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
"The public opinion has been sidelined by the authorities", says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He also called for the EU to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's financial interests are not undermined by the EU's efforts to improve the quality of life and to ensure that the EU's financial interests are not undermined.
Ruby Tuesday, a food chain with over 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercentia for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have easy access to the headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find out the phone number or e-mail address to report to the head office, and then make a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
'It was often a scary and unpleasant experience', says James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's legal adviser, who said it was difficult to follow up on complaints from employees.
Whereas previously problems were hidden from managers in another city or state, now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can be detected and addressed more quickly.
"I get a more holistic and comprehensive view of the reality of the employee", says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment lawsuits.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after the collapse of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen as a result of unethical practices in the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies realized they could no longer prevent their dirt from being publicly investigated.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control", says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, for which they charge regular fees.
It's a business model and opportunity that's been accepted by the investors, and both Glinth and Convercent have the backing of the investors.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and has raised $47 million in total.
Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of 60 million dollars in funding.
The investment is not surprising, given the links between enterprises, corporate culture and venture capital.
Several studies have shown that workers expect more from their workplaces than ever before.
In competitive markets like the Pi Valley, good wages and exciting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a truly useful enterprise.
"Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy it, feel listened to, and feel that their work is rewarding", says Nina McQueen, director of employee reward and well-being at LinkedIn.
Investors get a return when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees are committed.
Third-party analytics tools promise to boost employee engagement, so it's no wonder they're attracting investors.
Workplace culture experts say that information on employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if action is not taken on that basis.
If a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough or nothing changes, frustration can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions", says Russell Raath, managing director of management consultancy Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on data collection alone.
If the company does not take action, employees start to wonder if they have been heard
And what they think is important.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts staff interviews on a monthly basis and is able to tackle the problem on the same day it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from employees frustrated with the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has a better understanding of its employees and hopes that deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of its workforce in an industry characterised by high employee variability.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees", says Vitrano.
If it loses employees, it loses customers.
And without customers, there's no business.
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of tapping his naked female neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from a shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a rope outside her window.
She said the cell phone camera was in the apartment.
The woman, terrified of the incident, had run to the next room to get dressed.
When the woman arrived to check on the situation, the phone had been pulled up first, but soon after that it had been lowered back to the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of fraud has confessed to photographing the woman.
But he claimed he only took the woman's face.
The video taken on the cell phone had been removed, and the police had not been able to return it as evidence.
During the interrogation, the man has admitted to the crime, but denied any involvement in the crime.
The man had justified his photograph by saying that he loved his neighbor "crazy".
According to the news agency TT, the man is being charged in connection with the case.
Teachers demand more slack in the fall negotiations
The wage growth cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said Olli Luukkainen, president of the OAJ, on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday allowances highlights the disparity, he notes.
We cannot conclude agreements which do not involve holiday allowances.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be concluded once the private sector papers have been signed and the percentage increases are clear.
Luukkin predicts that, for example, the working conditions of OAJ will be agreed in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been revealed by Bone.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the JUK, the public sector consultation organisation for trained people.
The European Union has a long-standing commitment to the fight against poverty and to the fight against poverty.
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukki, the temporary holiday allowance cut further sharpens the wage gap.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher must be defined.
The OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the gap between the best and the worst performers is constantly growing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining, and so the disparities between pupils and regions are constantly growing.
The Bruins' day was long, as the NCAA cut daily practice from two to one.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. and a group of UCLA football players are staying to chat across the campus' new practice fields.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, their backs glowing with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is their lunch break.
After three hours of practice, the players in the university summer program return to the dorm to take their final exams, and the next morning they meet at the Wasserman Football Center at 7:30 a.m.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys", Bruins coach Jim Mora says just before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The governing body of university sports reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one, a change intended to ease the workload of the players, but has extended their days  at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
That's why the first three UCLA games started at 7:15 p.m. and it was hard to find room for the already full schedule of players.
The limitation of practice to one day means that there will be more practice days than before.The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six-year coaching career at Westwood that practice will be held at the same time as summer classes.
The program will be held 18 times before the start of the season opener on August 20th, when UCLA will face Texas A&M in September.
Mora says he's backing the NCAA's rule change, even though it's making the players' schedules even tighter.
"We put a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging", Mora says.
But the players are willing to work, they're great guys.
I think things will be easier when we get to Saturdays, when we have more time.
UCLA is closing the practice area to outsiders after camp, which is not easy, considering the direct view from the practice field to the adjacent parking lot and the Luskin Center, a luxury hotel that has already been bombed by footballs flying over the safety net behind the paint pole.
The Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements", Mora says.
The concern is that people can book a room and film the rehearsals there for video.
The video of the drill is quite expensive.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan.
Freedom for Rwanda
In Rwanda, Central Africa, presidential elections are scheduled for Friday, and the winner is already clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking a third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country's leadership since 1994.
That's when the RPF, a rebel group, stopped the genocide organized by the extremist groups.
Kagame was the RPF commander.
Kagame has been criticized for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of falsifying poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame is running for a third term because the constitution was amended, limiting the presidency to two terms.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely respected leader.
During his tenure, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and received an influx of international investment.
And Kagame has played a big role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to question whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamek has promised his people more freedom after the land is raised to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fake news by strengthening fact-checking
Facebook plans to send out more and more potential fake news to independent fact-checkers and post the results below the original article, the world's largest social network announced Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it is starting to use updated machine learning to detect fake news.
Facebook has been criticized for being the largest distributor of fake news, and many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has been a political debate in Europe, with French voters bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, backing a plan to sanction social media networks if they do not remove hateful content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that fact-checking is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass the independent reviewers' screens, and they want more background information so they can make more informed decisions about what they read and share", Facebook News Feed product manager Sara Su wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "Articles related to the Subject" feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Beginning of a Comic Book: A Castle Story
The small Scotney Castle in Kent is now known for the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout in the 1970s and 1980s.
Now, this charming location in the Bewley River Valley is the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a mopey-haired writer fond of old documents.
"I am thrilled to be able to study a text written by a person who died over 300 years ago", Rhodes says eagerly.
I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand.
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of Scotney families from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives, but in 2014 he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which was inspired by the National Library of Britain's archives.
"I was moved to tears when I saw the fingerprint on the letter, written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century", says Rhodes.
It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke because they used fire for lighting back then.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he is on the scene.
I love the archives!
The author, fascinated by the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian New Castle, its archives, its treasures and its rarities, such as hyenas' heads hanging on walls and bottles that had been in the whale's belly for centuries.
He toured the ruins and grounds of the old castle and had conversations with rangers, gardeners, and sometimes with book-illustrators.
In the evenings, he drank whiskey and started writing.
The immediate history of Scotney is rather unknown, as the castle was not fully transferred to the National Trust until the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation staff had just begun to go through the archives, and Rhodes describes how the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking all the excess to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You might think that land disputes are boring", says Rhodes. "But here families fought over even one barn.
I thought we'd just let it go.
Some of the stories in the book progress from the castle into English history, such as The Labourer, which tells of a man who soon after the castle's completion becomes involved in the English peasant uprising of 1381.
The book "Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex" mentions a riot at the castle in 1380, says Rhodes.
The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it occurred to me that a revolt could start with a riot.
Perhaps these events are connected?
Other stories in the book are closely linked to the castle's history such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have faked his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (this was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney, and the men of the family seem to have been quite vagrants, constantly getting into debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old ladies, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to fan the flames of a heiress.
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the Lifetime Mountain, a 20th-century reformatory that is now a lush plot of land.
Castle Scotney holds a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave", he says.
I wouldn't want to go back to this fucking place.
Relations with Russia are the worst since the Cold War .
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it is safe to say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg told CNN in an interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek closer cooperation with Russia.
But particularly since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Mr Stoltenberg said that NATO was still committed to preventing tensions from escalating to a peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had noted that the US-Russia relationship had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump urged congress to thank the countries for their poor relations, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko will stop the rematch with Anthony Joshua will not happen
Longtime heavyweight champion of the world in amateur boxing, Vladimir Klitschko, is retiring.
Klitschko, 41, from Ukraine, announced his decision Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who won gold at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of his fights.
He held several World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury knocked him out in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost the match after a fierce match with a knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
But Klitschko couldn't find the motivation to fight.
"I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley game", Klitschko said in a statement.
I've achieved everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I never could have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
Watch Klitschko's reasoning on the video.
Klitschko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he would like to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
From 2008 to 2012, the brothers won the World Cup titles in different leagues at the same time.
The weatherman in Finland is spellbound by the conditions: "Vie fiil"
Wrestling jumper Minna Nikkanen has been suffering from the conditions during the summer outdoor season.
Minna Nikkas has been having trouble with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken her away.
The conditions are unstable at the London World Cup.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The conditions have been this summer against the pole vaulter Minna Nika.
"I don't want to blame the track, but it was unbelievable that I couldn't even get the little flies to move properly", Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I've competed and trained here you know how many times and I've never experienced such a changing wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
"It's been really difficult to get the jump in this season, with the unstable winds in practice", Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather was talking in London on Thursday.
It's been a challenge getting the technology together, whether it's cold-proofing or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the edge off.
It doesn't make sense to waste energy in bad conditions.
He made it to the World Championships with his 455th powerlift.
We've got 445 out there.
It's not the same for everyone in London.
You have to stay calm and wait for better winds.
The target is to break the 460 barrier on Friday.
Why don't you go overseas and train?
That's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany for my freshman semester.
I got the jump together and the technique stabilized.
I probably should have done the same thing.
Normally, he's been in the gym for practice, but now the gym's been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
It's like 25 degrees.
I can use a little wind, as long as it's steady.
A seasoned ex-official silenced politicians at Yale: "We have no stock now and for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, the Juha Sipilä government must keep its heads in the sand and beware of inflating the state budget with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no share.
In 2015, the general interviewed retired Virtas at Wednesday's First Meeting.
The state budget for next year is just beginning.
The Commission has recently put forward a number of proposals from politicians, including raising the guarantee pension, reducing the car tax and supporting electric bicycles.
They are basically telling us that the elections are getting closer because when 10 percent of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no distribution reserves now and for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about theft when you're taking out a loan, Virtanen told Yale.
Virtanen stressed that all debt is owed to children.
Virtasa has a long history of preparing the State budget: he started as Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance in 1978 and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of the Budget.
He was lastly Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy before his retirement.
Virtanen noted in an interview with Yle that the 3% growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a peak from which we will start to go down next year, and Finland will expect a growth of 1% for decades.
Washington changes the rules for permanent residency .
According to media reports, President Donald Trump announced that the rules for permanent residency, or the Green Card, will be changed with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 a year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill is scheduled to be debated in both houses of Congress.
This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and can support themselves and have skills that are beneficial to our economy, Trump said, according to media reports.
The husband of the Danish queen doesn 't want to be buried with the queen in the same place .
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
This is Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side, the Danish court says.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal Household today announced that Prince Henry does not wish to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, court communications chief Lene Belleby told the newspaper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal with his spouse.
The court has said the Queen has long been aware of her husband's wish for a burial site and understands the decision.
A terrible moment on the road, the car almost hit the highway.
Tom was in a car with his step-sister and two small children.
They didn't get hurt in the accident, but they can't get the insurance money if they can't reach the other party.
The accident happened at the Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archived from the original on the construction site of Circle III.
Tommi from Vantaa tells us that his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his first wife, Riina, and the couple's two young children were driving along the motorway near Keimolanport on the Vantaalla in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the junction of Ring III to Hämeenlinnanväy, a white car was driving along the accelerator, which was to drive to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
If it wasn't for the evasive action, Tom would have gotten into the car.
I brake and turn the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi tells me.
The family car hit the railing at high speed.
The parents and two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little under three years old, the other is under a year old.
Apparently, we were lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one passed us, even though the place was busy.
The accident happened at about 5:20 p.m.
Tom said no one stopped by, and the family called 911 to help.
They got out of the car on their own.
An ambulance and rescue team arrived, and the family was checked.
The car went into a salvage.
Tom says that he and his first wife have little income, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a few years ago.
Without the other car's data, Tom says the family won't get the insurance money.
That's why the family is hoping for eyewitness accounts of the car that caused the family to crash.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the barn and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tom saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the beginning of the car's license plate was SIG.
If the perpetrator is not caught, I don't know how we're going to make it financially, we're still counting every cent.
Tom is hoping that those who saw what happened or know something about it will contact the police.
The Eastern Newfoundland Police Department and the Central Newfoundland Rescue Service confirm that they had a job at the scene of the accident on Tuesday night.
Contrary to what was originally reported, the other car was not in Tom's lane, but was driving from the accelerator to the side of the family car.
The play, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with relationships through the medium of humor.
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings his first directorial work to the What?
The Exposure is a musical theater about failed relationships and inadequacy.
Director Lotta Jappinen says it's still going to leave a good feeling.
The subject is treated with humor.
He says old feelings don't last.
According to Jäppinen, the summer theatre performance has been realized with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the show challenges us to think about what a person reveals about himself when he gets to know the new person.
Is he playing a role or is he approaching to unbutton the other jacket?
A play without plot, mixing fact and fiction.
Jappinen has directed and dramatized the play.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The play is a work of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the show draws on the ideas of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
He emphasizes that the book of Revelation does not directly tell us about his personal relationships or those of the group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own people care about the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I don't think relationships, especially in a relationship, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that The Self-Disclosure Book paints a contemporary picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
He says that many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least, you know, you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show is starring Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The other member of the task force is a costume designer named Ella Snellman.
The music is by Jappie and Rokan.
Love for the theatre started in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying theatre directing at the Turku Academy of Fine Arts.
Two years behind us, another one in front of us.
The passion for theater started during the Kouvola years.
She has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has acted at the University Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateater in Turku.
I'm getting more and more interested in steering.
The self-revelation was premiered last week in Helsinki at the Narr stage.
The presentation, which lasts for about 45 minutes, will also be shown in the future, at least in the university town of Jäppinen in Turku.
Self-revelation at the Kouvola What? Theater on August 4 at 7 p.m. and August 5 at 2 and 7 p.m.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year from a horrific motocross accident - fractured ankle
Few athletes in Finland are as unstoppable a force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of mates traveled the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years, chasing his dream of an Olympic gold.
The dream was realized in 2002, but Lahtela's business continued.
He was not only a tireless practitioner, but also an experimenter in new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a chemistry student has not tried at least once.
It's been a great motivator for practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells me.
In the end, one hobby was to stop the flood completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his skullcap and both arms were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I stabbed the wounds in my home for a year, Lahtela says.
Bad luck with the bay.
He also admits that his age may have been a factor in the accident.
Riding a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't ask for the limits.
It's just a sport so tough, it's not worth it for a 40-year-old like you to get too involved!
After the accident, Lahtela found himself in a strange situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He had a long career as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the past immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela tells me.
Even during training, Lahtela often challenged his protege in the slope and in physical tests.
Surprisingly, the stop was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally exhausted that even my own thoughts did not seem to make sense.
Not even in the sport.
It was good to be there.
I actually enjoyed it because I was really just getting to be, for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become head coach of Finland.
If he didn't stop, he's afraid he'd be burned out.
It's easier to find broken parts of the body than intact ones!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized how much I needed to rest.
Lahtela started as coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer pastime to replace the speedsters.
I traded my motocross for Frisbee golf!
That was a quick one.
At my worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not demand that his subjects be like him.
I'm not gonna force everyone to do the same thing.
Our culture of variety has space to be one of a kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been that way, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried.
It's here: a report on the technological development of sex robots  just when it started to feel like 2017 could not be any stranger.
- I know.
Sex robots are big business now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
'We need to start taking the spread of sex robots seriously', says Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the Foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples, and the type of its fingernails.
'Sex robots are being pushed but they are already being sold in fairly large quantities and we will see more of them', Sharkey said at the report's launch.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robotic ones with a warm-feeling silicone skin and AI-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot to his or her preferences, from eye color to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
Even more worrying is that the robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, even if they are shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
 Roxxy Gold's personality is as fully as possible adapted to the user's personality, advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It could be tired, or in a chat or in a "good mood".
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex robots, which replace real human relationships, but even more dangerous are the subjugation of women and the outright fantasies of rape when the user approaches a robot, for example, which is programmed to be shy and resistant.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator on their website:
Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their spread and development is a sign of something darker and deeper in our culture: a regression from gender equality to sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not buy sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, even though the FRR report indicated that their popularity is increasing.
But the marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people only start behaving strangely or offensively when the market allows it.
It's no coincidence that sex robots are becoming more common at a time when women's rights are being threatened around the world, and the White House is now occupied by a president who has boasted of harassing women.
The most disturbing aspect of the television series The Handmaid's Tale is not its powerful imagery, such as images of hanged bodies and eyes dug out, but the way the world of the series feels realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems surprisingly short.
Sex robots are being made to resemble real women (in the proportions of porn stars) as much as is technically possible.
The designers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as closely as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will of their own, no history, nothing to suggest independence or to break the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
A slave woman.
Police suspect two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, led by an ISIS commander.
The head of the Islamic State group led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to carry a bomb to an Etihad Airways plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior figure in the ISIS had also sent the bomb's construction parts to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be flown on July 15th, but the attempt was aborted before security checks.
Police have not been able to provide any details as to why the operation was halted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that would release a toxic colorless gas and take the device to a public place, such as a public transportation system.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever devised in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday in connection with suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation is continuing.
The good things about Trump?
It makes Mitt Romney look like a perverted figure of common sense.
The Trump era has already been replayed to the point of being overwhelmed by the fact that the sharp division of voters has also broken families on a daily basis.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers published advice columns on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want our information bubble to burst.
Less noticeable is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing poet from Chicago who's been at odds with our Republican family for a long time.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins, everyone knows - including a pro-Republican sibling with whom he's had a political dispute for decades - are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
It's a good thing at the dinner table, but more broadly, it comes with significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new lease of life, but the perverse influence of his presidency may actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we're talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won't be able to stand by and be horrified by his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem perfectly rational compared to Trump.
I remember, in my sickness, Mitt Romney's moderate version of insanity: dog on the roof of a car, 14 percent income tax (and his tax returns, we've seen them), which, compared to Trump, seem like very minor violations.
When Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be clear-headed, and that immediately feels like a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting, we took our kids to the Central Park Carousel, which is the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department and the best thing you can get in New York City for three dollars without caffeine.
The carousel horses are huge, the characters in the center  the ironic clowns and the terrified animals staring back are ominous, and the roaring music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's landmarks are gradually becoming disappointing: the views from high buildings become dull, the city's skyline becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city does not correspond to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not completely got over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a big traffic circle in North London.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience  to the point that two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old, and two women in their 40's enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the merry-go-round a full score if someone had asked for my evaluation, but thankfully no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card into the reader.
Same thing at the coffee shop in my corner, but there I'm also given the opportunity to add an estimate of 15 percent service charge when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down the archival interaction and puts pressure on the customer service representative to put his personality into play in a situation where it is not needed.
The store clerk smiled with a sorry smile as I tiredly gave my credit card a five-star rating.
Chief Kuqi was fired from Inter, "Because of lack of trust from management".
FC Inter today relieved Shefki Kuq from his duties as the national team coach.
The coaching duties will be taken over by Fabrizio Piccarè, who was previously assistant coach.
The other training team shall continue in their current duties.
The Italian has previously worked as an assistant coach at Sunderland, England.
Piccareta, 51, joined Inter's coaching staff in January and has completed his UEFA Pro Licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, the chairman of the board of directors of FC Inter, is very sorry for what happened.
Changing coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq lost the trust of the club's management, and there was no other option, Håkans said in a club press release.
Piccareta's contract is up until the end of the season.
He's in charge with the rest of the coaching staff for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to the Evening News, the team has been in turmoil for the past few Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players Thursday morning that the team's assistant coaches, Piccareta and John Allen, have been suspended.
Kuqi and Piccareta were heavily involved in the Inter match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a photo of her youth in the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violinist, posted a photo of herself as a teenager on Instagram.
The photograph has been added to by a series of tags which suggest that the musician in the photograph is a 16-year-old student at the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders at the serious young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's texting me.
If you can't see the picture, you can look it up here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
A year ago, she posted a couple of pictures of herself on Instagram.
The second picture shows her 20 years ago, the second one shows her now, as the mother of two children.
In his illustrations, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago, and today...
"I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look", Lampenius wrote.
And then he had added the English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecurity, confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating habits in previous years.
He was already in the hospital at 14 for anorexia and orthorexia.
Soon afterward, he developed bulimia, which was not revealed until 2006.
He started to heal slowly.
In addition to therapy and the bench, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year he was hospitalized for cuts to his wrists, which prison officials say he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing multiple shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the bathroom.
Prosecutors have said they plan to appeal, finding Pistorius' six-year sentence too lenient.
The Attorney General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians who were illegally camped in Greece were arrested, the country's foreign ministry said, according to the bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of people camping illegally in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone who camps in areas other than designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The Ministry has announced that the court may impose a fine.
The liquid content is sinking - already -7.7%
The stock of oil refiner Neste has plunged 7.7 percent at around 11:00 a.m.
Its pre-tax profit fell but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started today on the soft side of the ice, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock market opened, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index OMXH of the Helsinki Stock Exchange had fallen by 0,3% to 9509,48 points after about half an hour of trading and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had fallen by 0,3%.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which EUR 9 million was generated by the morning profit announcer Nestlé.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests otherwise: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help alleviate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causing stomach cramps, bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although people with irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the gut's immune system.
According to study leader Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the gut and make sure that harmful microbes that are hidden in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen the immune system, protecting the body from damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, it can lead to irritable bowel syndrome.
In the trials, resistance-enhancing immune cells were found in mice that had a specific bacterium in their intestines.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to produce immune cells, which is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the development of immune cells, which are part of the normal microbiome of the gut", says Professor Colonna.
 The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more immune cells they had.
If the same thing works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan may strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
In studying immune cells that strengthen endurance, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, the mice of the same species kept apart from the other group did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome of mice, the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was examined, six bacterial species were found in the mice that had immune cells, but not in the other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that had been raised in sterile environments and did not have an intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
To find out how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in a liquid and transferred small amounts of the liquid  without the bacteria  into immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells evolved into endurance-enhancing cells.
When the active substance was purified from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of cells that strengthened their endurance increased by about 50 percent, and when the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Cervantes-Barragan says that humans have the same endurance-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan cause cells from Lactobacillus reuteri to develop in humans in the same way as in mice, but genetic defects related to tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to encourage the development of these cells because they regulate inflammation in the intestinal lining", says Cervantes-Barragan.
 High levels of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their spread.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed him after Nemanja Matic signed him.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed him after signing Nemanja Matic, who made his debut for the club against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who joined from Chelsea for £40m, started the season with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's penultimate match before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best shape, as he was not on the blue jerseys' Asian tour before the season started, and managed to stay on the field for only 45 minutes - a change that Mourinho said would come before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius", Mourinho said.
We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later.
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were about to start the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to cut his starting lineup for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a "glorious job" by acquiring three of his four top players.
"Three out of four" of them have to thank the congregation, he added.
I'd be more satisfied if I got all four, but they did an excellent job.
The German team was upset by the volleyball for two rounds .
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup to Germany straight away with a score of 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German level of routine in playing is high.
Their game was the same in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents in a tight spot, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the pack.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to play along, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Finland, which has lost three of its four matches, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
A grand jury has already sent out challenges to Trump Jr's Russia meeting.
In the United States, a grand jury has issued a challenge to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitsa.
A grand jury convened by special counsel Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges over the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Vaselnitskaya, a well-known Kremlin informant.
The news agency Reuters reports the news, confirming the Wall Street Journal's report earlier Thursday of a grand jury being convened.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has issued challenges in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin insider Waterman, which took place during the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were then-campaign manager Paul Manafort of Donald Trump Sr. and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters, the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington, DC, is a sign of the intensification of the Russia investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in an investigation that seeks to determine whether Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his entourage cooperated with Russia.
A grand jury is expanding Mueller's rights to collect evidence, subpoena, and compel people to testify on the condition of a jury trial.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
A grand jury will weigh the evidence the prosecution has uncovered in the investigation and decide whether to prosecute the case.
A British inventor micro-transplanted himself to get into his home and car by waving his hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to micro-chip himself so that he can open the exterior door of his home, get into his office, and start his car by waving his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who now provides a service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's biotech technology.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant meets the medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchip used in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company is also making house and car locks compatible with microchips, which costs £300 to process one lock.
Northam is married, has one child, and has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when he places his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House display cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter to the White House's south lawn for an event showcasing American manufacturing was ordered to pay taxpayers $24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, which is designated Marine One when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of an event at the White House on July 17, 2017, to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials toured the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter made in Connecticut, the exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House war bureau had requested the helicopter in place by mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the south lawn for an "exceptional" event, according to Navy HMX-1 helicopter fleet records.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this, because this is an extraordinary event that is getting a lot of publicity", the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an e-mail the day before the event to his supervisor, who is the deputy commander of the naval air station.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the south lawn at 7 a.m. on July 17 and the event would begin at 3 p.m. The helicopter would not leave the site until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that evening.
The message also mentioned that if the helicopter was delayed from the White House, a second crew would be needed due to time constraints.
The original crew was in the helicopter at the time of the incident, and the unit's security personnel were with the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents obtained by TIME magazine do not indicate whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 was investigating whether the event violated the law.
"One of our questions was, 'Is this a violation of the Hatch Act?' "We were told, 'No, sir,' the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're welcome to join us", the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke in favor of the health care reforms that were then being considered in the Senate and looser government regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their trips,
But their use for photography alone is unusual.
Trump's actions drew attention in February when Air Force One rolled back the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, where Trump has strongly criticized his predecessor's use of the presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers from American materials in all 50 states", said White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of the HMX-1 unit are conducting regular training flights in the Washington area, and they're practicing on the south lawn to get the president to the White House with centimeters of accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours on non-presidential support missions that day.
The White House said there was no other cost to the taxpayer.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in the helicopter demonstration on the south lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of any presidential flights and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of the event.
According to the 2017 Department of Defense Hourly Compensation, the compensation level for a VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 records, the flights from Quantico Air Force Base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is significantly lower.
'Calculating the cost to taxpayers by the level of compensation is misleading', says Walters.
The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid to the beneficiaries of the measures under investigation.
At the time of the incident, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of the helicopter in the incident.
"The idea is to showcase American production", Spicer said.
I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their role in ensuring national security and, in doing so, probably employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopters and other defense equipment that so many Americans have worked so hard to build.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it up.
It's not clear if Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he was sitting in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Mr Sikorski very well", the President said. "I have three of them".

Venezuelan prosecutor demands right to prevent the appointment of new representatives
The Venezuelan prosecutor has filed a petition for a court order to prevent the country from appointing a new representative.
President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela has announced that the delegation elected in the last Sunday's vote will be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, the country was elected to a parliamentary body that could, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to the Attorney General Luisa Ortega, the motion to block the election has been requested because of suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also launched an investigation into electoral fraud.
He appointed two judges after the British company that organised the vote said the results had been rigged.
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million more than the actual number of voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the House of Representatives, and the 545-member House of Representatives includes Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the constitution, the House of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional amendment as Maduro's way of strengthening his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have indicated that they will not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro claims that the new legislature is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
They have injured numerous people and killed over a hundred.
Venezuela sank into financial crisis after the oil price plummeted.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is expected to vote again on Friday, when the new parliament is due to start.
Russian extradited to Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, a court in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senahi to nearly four years in prison for his involvement in a worldwide computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him on his way home.
Finland handed Senah over to the US justice authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, AFP news agency reports.
He was found guilty in March of this year of computer fraud, which had resulted in millions of dollars in profits.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving his sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly condemned Finland after the arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement accused Finland and the United States of having made the arrest in Finland without Russia's prior knowledge.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish out usernames and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data to further direct internet traffic, which was used to commit click fraud and distribute spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, the case demonstrates the ability of the United States to pursue cybercriminals operating in other countries.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8:58 p.m. Corrected spelling of the convicted person's name.
The trailer for the third season of Narcos, with Pablo Escobar out of the picture, the Cali cartel is now the star of a hit Netflix series.
Even though the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will be returning for a third and fourth season, with a trailer for the third season being released, which will feature new characters.
In the third season, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has turned its attention to the Cali Cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, run by four ghosts, operates like a Fortune 500 company, except there's a little more government bribery and violence.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, with Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) as the brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) as the liaison to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) as the operative in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes a return to Javier Peñana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian police officers to fight the war on drugs.
The new faces are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro. They are all in the same room.
The third season of Narcos starts on September 1st.
Kari Kola is creating an extraordinary piece of light art for Paris
The artist Kari Kola (pictured) from Joensuu is creating an extraordinary piece of light art in honour of the first UN Day of Light in Paris on 16 May.
Kola's going to Paris to do a light art piece called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness, day and night, sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building, the headquarters of UNESCO, and the Globe monument in front of it.
I want to make my work not only light but also dark.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem affecting the well-being of all of us.
Through my art, I can make concrete the things that I consider important, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme of the day.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he lit up the UNESCO headquarters in honour of the celebration.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-implement my art at UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanded significantly.
We will announce this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men got into a fight in the parking lot of a mall in Espoo .
Two men had a fight in the Big Apple parking lot in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in the prohibited direction.
There was a verbal argument between the drivers.
A driver driving in the prohibited direction would hit the driver of another car, causing the latter to move and hit the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the crashed car with a machine gun.
The man has admitted to causing damage and to having acted improperly.
Question-marked article by Timo Soin entitled "Then the Flood Came"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Timo Soini (pictured), published a blog post on Thursday, with the title question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to the governing party of 37 MPs.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The lyrics of the song contain references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the analogy of a flood.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrase "the deluge after us" or "the deluge after me" has become part of the history books.
The UN says Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political roles
Elections are only representative if they allow all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN mission, said that hundreds of women are running for provincial councils, three are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters are women.
'The role of women cannot be overemphasised', Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
The only way for elections to be truly representative and credible is for women to participate fully and be included in all aspects of the electoral process.
The elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have been making election threats at a time when international forces are shifting to an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the women's contribution would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain tourists threatens the culture of the region
Authorities are considering restricting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local anger is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian culture minister calls it "eat and flee" tourism: you stay for just a few hours and rush through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is a suffocating place for day-trippers who are just taking a quick trip to the city.
Narrow streets are difficult to move, and the grand squares are so crowded that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center as their homes have been replaced by hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian report on the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon "low-quality tourism".
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you're given two or three hours.
Follow the flag-bearing guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italy's Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschi.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the functioning of the place, the shops and the workplaces.
We need to preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic center of Venice.
At the edge of the square is the church of St. Mark.
The local anger is also directed mainly at cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 locals living in the historic center of Venice.
In 1951 the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians voted against mass tourism.
They say tourism has degraded their quality of life, destroyed the environment, and driven their inhabitants away.
About 2,000 residents leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years, Venice will be nothing but tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe, says Carlo Belframe, the organizer of the protest.
The equation is difficult, since ships bring much-needed income to Venice and create the need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is to move cruise ships away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, a resident of Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20 to 30 million tourists visit Venice each year.

On the motorway, bad traffic for miles
On the northbound lane of the Kuopio-Silinjärvi highway, there has been traffic jams for miles on Thursday afternoon when commuters return from work.
The area is being paved with highways, which will slow traffic, Savon Sanomat reports.
For road traffic, the speed limit is 50 km/h instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even within the 50 km limit, traffic had advanced on Thursday afternoon, but in some places it was practically walking speed.
The work was carried on Thursday afternoon at the Statue of the Apocalypse, or golden eagle, on the shores of Lake Siilin.
I can handle it without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to face the curse of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published some amazing photos of herself, including the Grand Canyon.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-meter run in March by running a lap time of 51.81.
A month later, he improved his 400-meter dash to a Norwegian record of 55.38.
An avid social media user, Iuel soon realized that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men around the world began sending Luella pictures of their genitals, apparently hoping that the young runner would take an interest in them.
I had to close my Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "shady pictures" from unknown people, so I had to change my account to private, Iuel told VG.
In the interview with the VG, Mr Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can guess, Luel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I'm fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Julia's family moved to Norway when Amalie was two.
When Amalie was 12, her family moved to Namibia for her father's work, and then to Pakistan.
Then it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, he trains under the guidance of three coaches, namely Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions. They just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records in the 400 metres and the 400 metres hurdles.
A foot injury put skier Janne Korve's entire career on the line, now he's in the World Cup: "It's nice to not hit anything".
It's been a good counting day, not a hit!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, my career was on the line.
A stress injury to his foot had forced him to the operating table in January, and the leg was unwilling to recover.
I also had a hand injury to my ankle.
I didn't know what I was doing this summer, whether to continue the boarding or not.
Sponsorship deals were cut and a lot of things were open, the Raven tells me.
But, you know, that's what they say, "Things tend to get better".
My leg healed, the sponsor extended my contract for two more years, and the blood started to drain again.
The decision to move on was easy after that.
I didn't know that until the first time I went to the ice cream parlor.
I was like, "Oh, shit, this is so much fun. Let's do a couple more rounds".
The raven didn't get down properly until the fall or October, but after a long pause in the landing, just practicing without pain has been a big deal.
The Raven has only been around a few races.
It's all right.
Competition has never been the most important aspect of the board game for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to focus four years on one game, and then you're in the heat of that week.
I can't bear to think that way, says the Raven.
Today, the Hawks compete in the semifinals of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although individual races do not keep him in the board game, in a tight race company he always gets fired up.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the board players chose the Norwegian X-Games, which were held at the same time.
It's a big race, and the visibility is high.
Although I think the value always depends on the conditions and the level of competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete on the Finnish 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's top players, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Raven.
It's nice to see the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point, when everything was new and I was so sick of everything.
It's a new flow for itself, the Raven thinks.
I can still keep up with the breast, but I can't, that's how much power I've got in my friends!
With a background in boarding, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Director legend Pekka Korve's son is hooked on the sport of medicine: the boarder has his own medicine horses, for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, I don't have time to be at Mass.
But every day, I check the nutrition records, and usually I check out some of the departures, says the Raven.
According to Korve, nutrition guidance and nutrition training are potential career plans when his boarding career comes to an end.
I don't want to go that far, but it's a likely option.
I feel like I'm learning it a little bit while I'm here on the snowboard.
I'm trying to keep up with the times, try to improve, maybe even drive some rides in the summer.
If that's my future profession, it's not hard to start once I'm already in the game.
The food items also include the Elitloppet food tour, which will be organized with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twins have chartered a cruise ship to Stockholm for the Elitloppet food race at the end of May.
The Raven and the Castle decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has been a commercial success, and people have been excited.
We're already at the point where we're not going bankrupt.
"There are still a few months to go, hopefully we can fill the ship", says the raven enthusiastically.
Attendo's foster home for Kite has caught everyone by surprise.
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-bed nursing home being built in Kite.
The 1,700-square-foot building will be completed next summer across the street from the health center.
In the UK, the question of where to find enough clients for the new unit is a common wonder, as many private care homes are now running short of clients during the civil war.
Anne Flink, Regional Director for Care Services at Attendo, commented that in the future, Kite will have increased demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Attendo bought the private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Erika from Kite last year.
The transaction was a business transaction, but the properties are reportedly leased for five years.
Flink says Attendo has no urgent need to move operations out of these premises.
More on that later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of the McVitie's plant in Scotland
The union is seeking confirmation from the management of McVitie's biscuits manufacturer of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish branch of GMB, the UK's general trade union, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which produces hobnobs and rich teas and other products, has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, which owns the McVitie brand, said it had invested more than £5m in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and union representatives would be "certainly the first to be informed" if there were any changes to the way things were being done.
In its letter to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to 'respond to concerns about the lack of funding for the modernisation of production lines'.
Drew Duffy, GMB trade unionist, is very concerned that the plant manager is not being given clear information on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
Families have worked here for generations and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area.
In terms of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising costs of living and the continuing contraction of production, East Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie production.
According to the spokesman for Pladic, the factory manager had received the union letter only the day before and the company responds to the letter directly because it values continuous interaction with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with the employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we are continuously evaluating all our businesses and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness.
According to the source, the company has invested over £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, in particular in its production lines and improvements to its operations.
We are aware of Tollcross' long history as a production facility and will certainly be the first to inform employees and union representatives if we are going to make any changes to the operation of the plant.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may be regretting its interest in Marco Verratti .
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar's ambition after paying £189 million to sign him, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about of the summer, with the French Ligue 1 side set to break the previous record, which was less than half that of Paul Pogba, who returned to Manchester United for £89 million.
Following the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's highest-paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him a weekly salary of over £500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be furious at PSG's actions and the way Neymar has been forcibly dismissed, with a source close to Barcelona saying that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they are going to sign our players, we will become their opponent and we will contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all the clubs.
But if they go after our players, they'll face the consequences.
Barcelona seem to have done just that: they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let the Italian leave under any circumstances, and it is possible that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar.

The phone calls trump claimed were made up, spokesman for the White House says, "I wouldn't say it was a lie".
The White House admits that the two phone calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's phone calls to both the president of Mexico and the leader of the Boy Scouts turned out to be fake.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no phone calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
Sanders said many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and that Trump had spoken to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen over the phone, they happened face-to-face, Sanders explained.
He spoke to the Boy Scouts, and they were disgusted.
Trump said Monday that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump for his success in fighting illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told him that few will cross the southern border of Mexico anymore, because they know the journey will be blurry to the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's what Trump was alluding to at a big meeting of the National Scout Association in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scout leader, he said it was the greatest speech they'd ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts announced that they were unaware of any of their top brass calling Trump.
According to the release, the statement made by the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, in which he apologized for Trump's speech to the scouts, speaks for itself.
Trump's speech at the Scout Association meeting was a source of much wonder, as it was unusually political in the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last fall's presidential election.
