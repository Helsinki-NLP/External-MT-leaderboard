Welsh Assembly Members Worried About 'Sitting Like Idiots'

The proposal arose because of a plan to rename the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.


For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, 'TWP' means lazy mind and PWP means feces.


In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter W is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the law on renaming, said:
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public opinion, and received widespread public support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.

The law on reforms will also include other changes related to the way the Assembly works, including disqualification of members of the Assembly, design of the committee mechanism.

Macedonia to vote in referendum on changing the country's name

The popular vote is set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece over its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to a territory of its own, and has repeatedly rejected its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.


St. Martin's Church is silent Harlem churches are in trouble
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today there are no two".
He says it's understandable that the bars are gone.
"Nowadays, people interact differently", he said.
"Bars no longer have living rooms where people can go on a regular basis".

He added that the remaining biotechnology centres in the area could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who are not helping.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are going to be white", he said, "so getting to the day when all the churches close together will accelerate this, because most of the people who move into these apartments are unlikely to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations, and Harlem only became a black town in 1870, and St. Martin's only became a metropolitan community ten years later.
The first white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which worshipped nearby, gave the building its own name.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of blacks under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of small businesses on 125th Street, as the street, which was a major place for shopping in Harlem, was reluctant to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused considerable damage to the building but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to renovate the building, and they commissioned the Carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called Carillon the "Church of the Poor".
The expert who read Carillon in July described it as something else: "a cultural treasure", "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The first in the world, according to University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng, was the first carillon to be played by a black musician. Dionizio A. Lind was a black musician who moved to the larger Carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mary Weather said St. Martin's Church couldn't find anyone else to replace him.
St. Martin's has been hearing a complex story of architects and contractors over the past few months, some brought in by the church's almighty leadership, others brought in by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish's governing body, Vestry, which includes the leaders of Alma, wrote to the diocese in July about their concerns, saying that although Vestry had nothing to do with hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese, the issue raised was that Vestry should "pay".

Sainsbury's to capture UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is preparing to take on brands such as Boots, Super Drug and Debenhams by opening department store-style beauty shops that employ specialist assistants.


Sainsbury said it would double the number of cosmetic products to 3,000, and for the first time these products would also include brands such as Revlon, SC, Twizerman and Dr. Pow Pow.

Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coop said that as supermarket chains compete with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, who sell more services and non-food products, outlets will be more like department stores.
Sainsbury's has been opening Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced Habitat outlets in many stores, and the two chains were acquired by Sainsbury's two years ago, which has added grocery sales and made the acquisition of the chains more profitable, the company says.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Sainsbury's partnered with Boots Sume in the early 2000s to test a joint venture, but the collaboration ended in disputes over sharing revenues from chemist stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's 281 store pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.

Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, commented: "We have radically changed the look of our beauty islands to improve the atmosphere for customers.
We have also invested heavily in hiring specially trained helpers who provide advice and guidance.
Our range of brands is designed for all purposes, and the attractive atmosphere and convenient locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old fashioned way of shopping and is indispensable for customers.
Peter Jones is 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal

"We don't comment on his business".
After a good fight, we fell in love.
He mocked criticism from the media for making comments that some might consider "unfriendly to the president" and for raising hopes for the North Korean leader.
Why did the president let it go so far?
Trump joked by imitating the "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up anything".
Trump also said he was pleased with Kim's interest in a second meeting after the initial one in Singapore in June, which he hailed as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
The nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ring Yo Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "relevant response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He also noted that the US continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump shared a more optimistic outlook in his rally speech.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea", he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
millions of people would have been killed.
"We're really good together now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results, such as halting rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remains of the US servicemen to their homeland.
He justified his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to talk the way the president should, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this limited space, we'll have about 200 people standing here right now",Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.

See: Daniel Sturridge's consolation goal for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League, with Daniel scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Zerdán Shakiri while he was about 30 yards from the Chelsea goalpost, at which point Liverpool were 1-0 behind.
Sturridge hit the ball to his left before he hit the post.
This effort was to fly the ball over the box and slide the ball face up to the right side of the net.
Kopa Arissabalaga, who jumped, hit the ball and finally shook the net.
"I was trying to be in that position to get the ball, and always a player like Shaq would throw the ball as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Sturridge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kane running, I touched a ball, and then I didn't think much, I took a shot".
Chelsea were 1-0 at half-time, with Belgian striker Eden Hazard scoring in the 25th minute.
In that match, the Blues striker gave Matteo a pass before turning around almost in the middle of the field and rushing to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go pass in the middle of the field.
He then led Hazard to the box, and gave Kowaki a beautiful throw.
Hazard, who was running the line, kicked the ball with his left foot, and kicked the net, passing Liverpool's Alison Becker.

The removal of Cromwell's statue should be called poetic justice, because England's cultural relics and religious artifacts were destroyed by his fanatical Puritan followers, just as the Taliban had done.
The Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to twist history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: "The current debate about the removal of statues made it imperative that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, which was erected outside the Palace of Westminster, should become the target.
The iconoclasm that occurred during the English Civil War was never ordered by Cromwell, nor was it by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell is now being sacrificed for the events of his predecessor, Thomas Cromwell, in the previous century.
The Cromwell statue, which was magnificently built by Sir William Hamo Thonicroft, is a testament to the 19th century opinion of Cromwell and part of the history of a leader who many still consider to be worthy of celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps many, in the late nineteenth century as someone who, during his dictatorship, protected Parliament from pressure from outside forces.
The question of whether or not this is a complete and accurate representation is an ongoing historical debate.
It is indisputable that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation over time and that Cromwell is the acknowledged individual leader representing one of the two factions that have divided and fought.

Chinatown farmer killed by pig


A pig farmer preparing vaccines for pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2015.

Then the next morning, his cousin found him dead, and a herd of pigs was found outside.
The relative said there was a big pig in the cage, bleeding from its mouth.
The report states that the 550-pound pig was killed by the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were all blood, and his legs were all torn to shreds", he told the Guang Evening News.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I found his body an hour later.
The pig that attacked was neither the dead man's nor his relative.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent someone from attacking, and that police had collected evidence from the scene of the murder.

Although rare, there have been recorded cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured in the attack.
10 years ago, a Welsh farmer was thrown into a 650-pound pig tractor, and his wife saved him by scaring the pig.
2012 A Manitoba Kurch, who knew about a farmer in Oregon who was killed and eaten by his pigs, told CBC News that although pigs are not generally aggressive, the taste of the blood may have been a 'driver'.
"They're playing.

The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by over 20 million people.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who in 1980 accused six television networks of sexually assaulting her, have been seen by over 20 million people.

Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had broken into a high school party and tried to undress him.
Kavanaugh said in his unemotional testimony that he was 100% sure that nothing like this had happened.

The company has calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.

The Fox News anchors strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, which led to an average of 5.69 million viewers across all networks during the entire day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC is in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS received 3.1 million viewers, NBC received 2.94 million, MS NBC received 2.89 million and CNN received 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.

Flake was the star of Friday's dramatic events.
The office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, and on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters chanting slogans against him as he tried to climb into an elevator for a judicial committee trial.
CNN broadcasted a live scene where he stared down for several minutes as people spoke to him with hatred.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"You have power when many women are powerless", he was told.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he had more to say at the committee meeting, before the elevator door closed.
Later, when the committee was voting to decide whether to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote, it was broadcast live by all cable networks and broadcast networks.
Flake said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would file charges against the nominee next week, which is what the Democrats, who are in the minority, are asking for.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Kruns and later with several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had weight, because it's clear that the Republican Party doesn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.

Scott's efforts to get the ball in the goal's face were foiled by the Scott Robinb Sun, who cut the opposing team to the face, and Alan Leith Gow, who hit the goal's face, returned Craig Halcott's header.
Livingston, who knew we had confused the visitors with their performance in the middle of the field, was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them.
Then this important goal was born.
Rangers gave up a free kick, and then Livingston tried for an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson delivering the ball to Menga, who scored by throwing the ball from the middle of the box.
Rangers held the ball most of the time, but the home team's defense was unbreakable, with goalkeeper Liam Kelly holding the net steadfastly,
Alfredo Morelos, despite the fact that the ball was held in place, continued to play in the second half.
Scott Pitman also tried to score, but the Rangers goal did not yield, and the ball went out of the open field in the Livingston style.
The crosses continued to come to Livingston's box, but all was lost, and two penalty claims were dismissed for Halkett foul and handball to substitute Glenn Middleton.

Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was able to put the defense in the right position, keeping Conor Goldsun and Joe Worrall active throughout the game.

They didn't have the ability to finish, and they only managed to get in the face of the home team once, and this game is a warning for the Rangers because they are now down in the points.

"While the tsunami threat was rising yesterday, people were on the beach and the victims were people who did not flee immediately after the warning", said Supuoto Parwo Ngroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it washed cars and logs and houses and hit everything on the land", said Ngroho, adding that the tsunami travelled at 800 km/h (497 mph) through the open sea before hitting the shore.

Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency said that the geography of the city, which is located on a long and narrow coast, may have increased the power of the tsunami.
Nugroho said the damage was "extensive" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were recovered from under the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could be higher in the coastal area called Dongola, 300 km north of Palu and close to the epicenter.
Nugraho said communications systems from Dongola were "disrupted without any information".
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse", said the Red Cross.
The agency was widely blamed for not warning of a tsunami in Palouse on Saturday, but officials explained that the waves were breaking up within hours of the warning.

West has previously stated that the new name is not only an abbreviation for his current professional name, but that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, 'ye' meaning 'you.'" West commented earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I'm you, I'm us, all of us.

The US should double its funding for AI.


China last year introduced a plan to be the world's leader in innovation by 2030.
"Considering the fact that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we are looking forward to the next step in AI", Lee said.

Li, who wrote a book published by Huffington Mifflin Harcourt titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", is currently CEO of Sinovention Ventures, and has invested in China's most important AI company, Face++.
He built an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University in 1980, defeating the highest-ranked American player, Othello, and later found work as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's China branch.
Lee lauded the impact of US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when there would be another opportunity to meet the next philosophers.
Lee said researchers in the US often struggle to get government funding.
"China is not taking the best academics, it's the corporate companies", said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring bright students from top universities to work on AI in recent years.

"I think people who do PhD in AI should naturally be in a position to get a green card", Lee said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its "Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan".
China's National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) is funding people in academia, just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies are funding US researchers, but the quality of the work of academia in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an initiative aimed at engaging stakeholders from both the industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DAPRA announced that it is investing $2 billion in AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.

Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move intended to see a resolution to a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union or NATO.
Greece has a province within Greece called Macedonia, which represents a claim to its territory, and so Greece has blocked Macedonia's applications for membership in NATO or the European Union using its veto power.
The two countries reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but the nationalist opposition argues that the name change would weaken the ethnic existence of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubt that this minimum requirement might be met, as the referendum would require at least 50 percent of the vote to be valid.
The ballot in the referendum read: "Do you agree to membership in NATO and the European Union in accordance with the agreement with Greece?"
The pro-renaming faction, including Prime Minister Zoran Sajev, argues that the renaming is the price Macedonia will have to pay to seek entry into bodies such as the European Union and NATO, as Macedonia is one of only two countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I am here to vote for the young generation of Macedonia, for the future of the country, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, the European Union means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.

PM Sajev said that Macedonia, which currently has an unemployment rate of over 20%, will be able to attract the necessary investment and NATO membership.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of the renaming, because 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of EU membership and NATO membership", said Sajev after the vote.

According to a poll conducted by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30% and 43% of voters participate in the referendum - less than the required percentage.

The failure of the referendum will be a serious setback for the policies of the government that came to power last May and is oriented towards the Western world.

The Labour Party is no longer a broad-based party.
You will not forgive the hypocrites.
I was not surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to warn me.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome - remember, I said it all out loud.

In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, Jeremy has disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues such as responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe.
The notice for Saturday's Nottingham East Labour meeting stated, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".

seriously, many meetings today are not of this nature, and the promise of "more kind, more gentle" politics has been forgotten for years; indeed, if such a promise ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
Jeremy was the leader, and my colleagues, who I thought shared the same political views as I did, were hoping that I would go in the opposite direction, take a view on national security and the single market, the European Union, that I would never agree with.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm certainly luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I get are politically related.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racial abuse every day but never shy away.
one of the most frustrating aspects of this era of politics is that the screaming levels are seen as natural.
Jeremy Corbyn last week suggested that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy, I was provoked by the Thatcher government's lack of tolerance, which actually paved the way for my entire school classroom, and I've always tried, as a local councillor or as a government minister, to bring better public services to those in need.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Nothing in Nottingham Ease is likely to be confused about my policy views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
I have one thing to say to those who are promoting Friday's resolution: as the country moves towards a Brexit that hurts homes and businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party.

But the Melrose started well in the second half, and when Patrick Anderson's effort led to Baggott's goal, they were able to reduce the gap to five points.
The game was delayed by a serious injury to Ruyarid Not, but when the match resumed, Ayr recovered the jump, and Stafford McDowell's effort led to a climax.
Then the temporary captain of Iron was given a yellow card, and the chance offered to Melrose in the magic circle of intense stress, Bruce Colvin, failed to reach the finish.
Although the home side started to bounce again, in the penalty line-out, when Hutchinson was given a yellow card for pushing Climo without a ball, McPherson made an attempt by bouncing towards the advancing Iron.
Klimmo again made it to the goal as he did when the match resumed, before taking Rowe on a box kick from David Armstrong and sending Gregor Henry from the edge of the field for the fifth attempt of the home side.

Bolivia's influential local president Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - has high hopes for Monday's ruling.
"We are on the verge of returning to the Pacific Ocean", he vowed last August.

The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction over any matter within Chile's territorial limits and does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ has reached a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.

"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the current issue of access to the sea", said Sarate.

Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold talks.



Calzadilla also denied the claim that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was focusing on the maritime issue for his political gain.
"Bolivia should never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This is a chance to see what we need to get past".
North Korea says it won't get nuclear disarmament as long as the US can be trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ryong Ho has said that the nation will not denuclearize unless Washington is trusted.

He urged the United States to be prepared to honour the promises made during the Singapore Summit.


The US is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament action.

The latest in a huge hat collection coming to the High Street next door has been displayed at Parish Fashion.
if you want to increase the size of the hat collection or cover the whole veil, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have released a line of oversized hats that make them look crazy for their SS19 collection on the runway.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Valentino's masterpiece was an over-the-top light brown hat with a swamp-like feather-like width on the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-laced turmeric, a magician's hat, and a pineapple - but these hats weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also illuminated a collection of strange faces, many of which are suitable for use on Halloween.
These attractive coloured masks are sewn onto the lips of many, and reminded the masks of Hannibal Lecter more than horticulture.
one of the creations resembled a complete scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while the other was similar to a melted ice cream cone.
if you're still in the big fashion craze, you're in luck.
The style-conscious say that these large-size hats will soon be available in shops near you.
This is a large size hat, which is a La Bomba style, with two wide edges, and it's a wicker hat, and everybody from Rihanna to Emily Ratajuski wore this hat.
The cult label behind the impractical hats that went viral across social media, led to another big creation, a straw beach bag the size of a swimsuit, with models walking around the ramp wearing it.
Parisian Fashion Week's La Riviera SS19 collection was created from a standalone, white leather handled, striped orange raffia bag with raffia braids on top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to Fimmel: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the High Street next summer - because the designer has made such an impact, it will be hard to ignore the need for oversized accessories.'

Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, with another set of exceptional test results, continued in 2018, and individual and collective success in sports, music and other community endeavours, which have reinforced academic excellence.
represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and with over 30,000 students across Scotland, they strive to provide the highest standards of service to students and parents.
The objective of the Independent Schools is to prepare students for higher education, their chosen careers and their position as global citizens.
As an area of education where an exemplary school curriculum can be designed and implemented, we see that modern languages will remain a popular and desirable choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language that comes to mind, it goes to their head.
"Tota, nai nai nai nai nai nai nai".
This is a powerful reminder that when you want to build relationships with people from other countries and gain their trust, you cannot rely solely on English.
From the recent test results of this year, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rate amongst independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved Higher Grade A.
Data collected from the 74 member schools of the CIS shows that 72% of students achieved Higher A grades in Mandarin, 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish achieved A grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an undeniably important skill set that will be needed by children and students in the future.

A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers cited lack of language skills as the most challenging reason for recruiting candidates for positions.
Language skills are becoming more and more essential to prepare students for future employment opportunities.
As languages become more and more important in the future jobs, these skills are indispensable in the globalized world.
Whatever career path they choose, if candidates have learned a second language, they will have long-term skills like this, so they will really be favored in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will naturally put a person who knows multiple languages far ahead of the competition.
2013, a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 UK adults revealed that 75% of the adults were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to start a conversation, and 15% of the double-blind respondents said that the only foreign language they knew was French.

Knowing more than one language, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school teaches different languages.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a handful of languages to choose from within the independent schools, with teachers who are experts in the field of foreign languages.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Of course, truly modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for children in Scotland.

Trump's West Virginia rally tonight at what time and how can you watch this online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 PM (Eastern Time).
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to make reference to this week's trials of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been tainted by the rising allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, which has been delayed by a week due to the ongoing FBI investigation.
The primary purpose of these conference papers is to give the Republican Party a slight lead in the November election.
Thus, Reuters reports that those who are familiar with President Trump's campaign have said that the purpose of the five rallies next week is to "energize volunteers and supporters as the party is trying to maintain and increase the Republican majority in the House of Representatives".
Control of Congress is critical to the president's agenda, so as we heat up the campaign, he will visit as many states as possible,a spokesperson for Trump's campaign told Reuters, but the spokesperson declined to be named.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, which will be held at the Westbank Co Arena in Wheeling, will attract followers from Ohio and Pennsilvania and get Pittsburgh media attention.
Trump also visited West Virginia last month, making this his second visit after Saturday's rally, where he won the 2016 election with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is far behind in the polls.
The fact that the president is going to have to get ahead in the opinion polls is not a good sign for him,said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the fight for the long haul as they head into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Forums on Saturday afternoon may have been what this year's Ryder Cup really needed.
The fluctuating gameplay is a completely fabricated command, but it's something that players actually believe in, especially in games like this.
Then where do they say the advantage is now?
"They were six points ahead, now four, so I guess that's a little bit of a leap for us", said Jordan Speith as he left the game.
Europe has a clear advantage in the 12-match series, with four points.
The Americans, however, feel that the wind is at least slightly in their favor and that they have enough to dare. The performance of both Speeth and Justin Thomas is not a minor encouragement. They are proud that they both played together all day and scored three points out of four.
From Tea to Green, the deadly player, Speeth, is at the forefront of the show.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The same cheers were given to his dog, who won the match in the 15th, with the same roar as he told people he believed the American team was not out of the game.
You really have to know your game and be concerned,speeth said.
Tis all that's left for each player now.
18 holes to prove your mettle.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points than Speedy and Thomas in the last two days, and the Ryder Cup is undisputed.
Europe's favourite, but the twins are not to be mistaken for.
Mollywood were the only pair not to take a bogie shot on a Saturday afternoon, but they did Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and then the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The fact that they are the ones to beat on Sunday, and the way their energy seems to flow from the noisy crowd, confirms that there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari to secure a European chance when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
It's better if you both play different holes at the same time.
Though, talking about European glory remains a thing of the past.
morning forbowl hero sergio garcia, when he paired with alex noran, was handled with ease by buba watson and web simpson.
On the first nine holes, a bogie and two doubles pushed the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit they couldn't get out of.
n't nobody gonna get you out of your hole on Sunday.
The interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give each other, the way any strategy can change in an instant, makes forballs and forums fascinating to watch up close.
Europe, who have played well as a team so far, are heading into the final day with a good lead, but this foursomes session has also shown that Team USA, which some, especially their country, suspected, has a fighting plan.
Europa 10-6
Europe, who emerged from Saturday's Forbes and Foursomes games with a 10-6 lead over the United States, are heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a healthy lead.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thomas Jorn's European side, who were trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side, who were trying to improve on their 3-1 series lead at the morning forbowl.
The U.S. was more resistant to the Forces, winning two games, but it didn't make up for the shortfall.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the title.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Mollywood" after a busy weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four matches.
Then they teamed up to beat the self-confident Woods and the American rookie, Bryson DeCamp, with a much stronger 5 and 4.
Woods, who was drawn in two games on Saturday, has shown explosions of excellence, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the forwards and forwards, including seven in a row.
Justin Ross, who had rested for the morning's Forbes, joined Henrik Stensen in the Forums to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopke, who were ranked first and third in the world, 2 & 1.
Tota,on's a nice, windy day southwest of Paris,Europe couldn't take it all.
Triple-Major winners Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.


2 days in the 2nd place, but looks like they're going to be out of it for Sunday.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament "has no way" because of lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions are increasing mistrust in the US and that there is no way for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
North Korea has taken "significant steps towards its reputation" since last year, when it stopped nuclear and missile tests, demolished a nuclear test site and pledged not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology, Ri Yong told the UN's annual general assembly.
However, we have not seen any similar response from the US, he said.
"We have no faith in our national security without any faith in the United States, and we have no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally in such circumstances".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

North Korea is trying to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has insisted that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for the lifting of the existing tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US is pushing for 'nuclear disarmament first' and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the 'declaration of war over,'" said Ri.
"The idea that we are on our knees with sanctions is a pipe dream of people who are ignorant of us.
Problem is that our distrust is growing because of the continuing sanctions.


️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, this year at the UN, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said more steps needed to be taken and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms itself.

China and Russia are demanding that the UN Security Council reward Pyongyang for its actions so far.

The Security Council has unanimously lifted sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.





Harvard students studying a sleeping course
This year, a new course has been launched at Harvard University to get all students more sleep, and is being launched as a fight against the growing culture of "macho" studying all night long with caffeine in it.
One academic found that students at the world's top university often lack clarity about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Sisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it is the first course of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"When I was done, a girl came up to me and said, 'I'm a senior, what's the point of telling me this now?'
She said that nobody had told her about the importance of sleep - this surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
This course, which was first introduced this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits are academic, how it helps with latent performance and improves their overall well-being.
The decision to introduce the course was made by the university following the discovery that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week, said Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Services.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Another section explains to students how chronic sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
'We know this won't change student behavior immediately.
"We believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health consequences of choosing to smoke", added Prof. Sisler.

"Safety weapon" for combating stress, fatigue and anxiety should be ensuring good quality and adequate sleep, he said "When we don't sleep to avoid weight gain, we're pushing the brain into hunger mode, which causes a constant hunger".
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Sisler design the course, which Raymond attended last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course has opened his eyes and inspired the whole campus to do this course.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Professor Sisler recommended that students should consider setting alarms to tell them when to go to sleep and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can traditionally cloud your circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleeping.

The Iberrocks were looking to record their first away win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered just their second defeat in 18 games as Gerard's manager, which put them eight points behind the unmanageable Hearts of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, but it was unlikely that the Rangers would retaliate.
Rangers now down to sixth, Livingston to third, just behind Hibernian by goal difference.

Gerard made eight changes to the team that went to the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, by contrast, dropped the same Levi 11 that had scored a point from Hearts last week, and the well-trained team must have made him so happy that he was able to breathe the opponents' breath at every turn.
Though the Rangers may have dominated the position, Livingston handled the ball well.
They should have scored when Mengo's first league pass was sent to Alan McGregor's goalpost in the second minute of the game, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
Kagan Jacobs's highly skilled freak approached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to make a shot that boosted him to the back post.
Rangers took control, but their forward play seemed more hopeful than believable.
Alfredo Morelos, 15's, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, he felt he should have got a penalty, but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but a header from Lassaná Collibaly and a dispassionate kick from Ovie Izzaria did not bother former Iberox goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Levy's 34-minute goal may have been against the grain, but their unity is in the balance, and no one can deny that they deserved it.
The Rangers failed to manage a sophisticated set piece by Jacobs.
When Declan Gallagher delivered the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield did not respond. Robinson chose Mangan to finish the simple without giving up his composure.
Gerard responded by dropping Ryan Kent instead of Collibaly at half-time. The change was almost immediate. The winger made a move with Morelos, but a heart-rending Kelly rushed from his line to stop it.
Livingston was exactly what kept the visitors entertained, with Lithgow and Halkett hitting long shots one after the other.
Holt's side could have pulled their lead in the final stages, but McGregor denied Jacobs and Lithgow the opportunity.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton argued for another late penalty when he teamed up with Jacobs, but again Thompson refused.
: inventor of the Geiger counter
Sunday Morning
Geiger also developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become a major reference in science and pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboy scientists:
"What is this plot?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
"When you turn on these earphones, you can hear the effects of radioactivity in the minerals".
"Tell me, I'm sure this is going to blow!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.

A vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to detect and kill shitty cells.

The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a lab.
They can then 'see' a common protein that causes many cancers, and then they can inject these cells back into the patient.
A trial of a vaccine in patients with multiple cancers is showing promising results.
When a woman was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize scrotum cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for over 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein known as HER2, which causes many cancers, and then injecting these cells back into the patient.
"Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine", says Jay Bersofsky, professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.

A similar approach, which takes immune cells from patients and teaches them how to target cancer cells, has been successful in treating leukemia.

"They say I'm in a sunken place", West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sinking place? Wear my Superman cap because that means you can't tell me what to do", he said.
Try the love".
Hearing his comments, audience members were stunned at least twice, and SNL cast members were stunned, where one person told the publication: "The whole studio fell into a death silence".[]
West was introduced as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had recently passed away.
West dressed up like a Perrier Bottle and sang "I Love It" to the surprise of many.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, the head of conservative group TP USA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing out in the crowd".
Karen Hunter, the talk show host, tweeted that West was just like that, and it was absolutely amazing.
"But I will not decide to reward (buy his music or clothes or support his 'art') someone I believe is inciting and throwing up an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free to go.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is attacking the toxic masculine
Kit Harrington is a fictional character, played by John Snow, in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old star, however, attacked the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such roles on screen make young boys believe that they need to be rough to be respected.

Kitt, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that she 'strongly' believes that the issue needs to be addressed.
'I feel very strongly now personally - where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he asked.
"What are we teaching boys growing up about the problems we're seeing today?"

He continued: 'What is instinctive, what is taught?
What is it that TV and the streets teach young boys that they have to have certain characteristics to be a man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
"Cos something's wrong with the younger ones".

HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people have been infected with the disease in the country.

The majority of the new cases are sexually transmitted, marking a shift from the previous ones.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly in parts of China, as a result of blood transfusions using blood from infected individuals.

HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem amongst LGBT communities in China.
China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997, although discrimination against LGBT people remains severe.

Sexual inadequate protection is often the cause of disease.

US Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information about Republican US Senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
Los Angeles Democrat emphasized that these are just claims made by "far-right" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, more vile lies, Waters tweeted in a statement.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orin Hatch.

The leaked information online was made shortly after all three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office, and conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the information of a member of the Waters staff was released.
"This baseless allegation is completely false, completely false", Waters continued.

This baseless accusation is completely false, completely false.
Waters' statement online drew criticism from people including former White House press secretary Ari Flesher.
"There's a rage in this denial", wrote Fleischer.
It indicates that they do not have the emotional maturity to be a member of Congress.
When someone accuses you of something you didn't do, you shouldn't get angry.

Flescher was trying to compare Waters' response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics had alleged appeared extremely angry during Thursday's trial.

"If it's true, it's a big deal", he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that the office has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these false claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to light and that they are legally held accountable for all their actions that cause damage or danger to all or any of my employees, she continued.
Johnny English Strike Again review - The Powerless Spiceful by Rowan Atkinson
It's now a trend to seek out Brexit references in any new British-tinged film, and it seems to apply to this second installment of the 'Johnny English' action-comedy spoof franchise - the franchise that began with the 2003 film 'Johnny English' and was revived in 2011 with 'Johnny English Ribbon'.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He is indeed a lazy secret agent, and although he has from strange hypocrisy to a smooth appeal, a powder of Mr. Beans' imaginations and a touch of the imaginations of the young man who contributes a single note to the 'Charity of Fire' theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony make him look like Inspector Clausov.
He is based on the traveller and mystery man who once played Atkinson in Barclaycard TV commercials, which no one remembers anymore.
There's a good moment or two in this latest Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter, wearing a medieval coat of arms, with the rotating blades making a sound for a while on the helmet.
Atkinson's ability to be physically funny is evident in this film, but the jokes are powerless and oddly overblown, especially in an era where "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently add comedy as an ingredient.
The humor in the film feels more tailored to children than adults, and I didn't feel the wild adventures of Johnny English were more innovative or focused than the silent film fun that Atkinson played as Mr. Bean.
UK is in serious trouble
A cyber hacker breaks into the UK's super-secret web network and reveals the identities of all British agents working in the field of covert intelligence, disappointing the agent on duty - unfortunately, Kevin Eldon, who plays the agent, has only a small role.

The Labour Party denied reports that the British were planning a scheme to allow four-day work weeks, but to buy five-day wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a progressive plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but pay five days' wages.
The party reportedly wants the profits made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be passed on by company bosses to workers by giving them an extra day off.
If this happens, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will be able to buy back their old wages.
The idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and the party is planning to tilt the country in favour of the workers, news sources say.


'It won't happen overnight, but the four-day work week is a perfect aspiration for the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and as the party's overall industrial policy.'
The Labour Party is not the first party to adopt a four-day work week, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.

A Labour spokesman said: 'The idea of a four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the 'faceless directors' and 'profits' of utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in the whiting companies may not get their full stake back, as a Labour government could be charged 'cuts' based on perceived wrongdoing.
He confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector enterprises to employees.
"60 Minutes""Lind C. Graham and John F. Kennedy asked if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh would change their minds.
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, has been delayed by at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings will persuade any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes C" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if finding anything by the FBI would lead to a reversal of their decision.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "Of course".
"I told you I was going to trial, I told you I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, after the allegation came out, I called him and asked, "Did you do this?"
He showed determination, determination and unshakability.
i, Graham's vote seemed to be set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's just an accusation shot", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has been very brave in denying it", Graham added, quoting Christine Balsi Ford.
Nobody they named could confirm this.

"I don't see anything new".

US Navy could use "barricade" to disrupt Russian energy exports: Home Secretary
The Washington Post reports that US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Sinek revealed that Washington would seek the help of the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East.
Sinké accused Russia's intervention in Syria of being a way to find new markets, and it should be noted that Russia is intervening there at the invitation of the legitimate government of Syria.

We have the ability to ensure that the sea lanes are open and remain open, and to block their energy if necessary and ensure that it does not reach the market, because we have the United States Navy, he said.
He was addressing participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that in practice they are one and the same.

The Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, excluding Russia, which would be a much cheaper option for European customers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to back out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is making Germany a "prisoner" to Berlin and Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be seen as a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Mosul in September.
The US position was met with a backlash from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading trade union, has called on the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big headache for me when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieterich Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Federal law mandates that all claims for asylum be settled based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, but the 'Front-of-the-Court Brief' claims that such a prohibition violates that principle.

"By contrast, here on the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you can see limited voices of dissent, and you cannot see the true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic path, because the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party",he wrote.
He also wrote that his article "slipped one of China's leading newspapers from its promise to publish", but he did not mention which newspaper.

"This is messing up the GOP",said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee,
"It's not about the committee vote, or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed to the bench, but about the way Republicans handled the allegation and how Republicans treated the victim", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats pick candidates.

A new opinion poll conducted by Yugaw shows 41% of people believe in Ford's swearing-in cause, definitely or incidentally, and 35% said they believe in Kavanaugh definitely or incidentally.
38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied either implicitly or accidentally in his oath, compared to only 30 percent who said the same about Ford.
Following a request from Flake, The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating allegations put forward by Ford and at least one other wrongdoer, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford was sworn in last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee for having attacked Kavanaugh himself while he was 17 years old.

Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
InRupt is the latest project in this technology legend, built on Berners-Lee's own open source platform, Solid.
Solid® allows users to choose where to store data and which people to allow access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind the Input was "world domination".
"We need to do it now", he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It will contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all running on the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about online personal data stores is that it is entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information can be accessed by which people.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind InRapt is to be the company that provides the resources, process and appropriate expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee and Bruce and IBM, and a community of some on-staff developers and volunteer coders hired to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the InRupt web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete overhaul of their business models overnight.
"We don't ask their permission".
In a post published in the Saturday Media, Berners-Lee wrote, "The mission of Input is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been influential in the debate on net neutrality.

Bernhard von: Priest who won the Victoria Cross for his part in World War I
100 years later, his fellow countrymen commemorated the only Church of England priest to have won the Victoria Cross for his part in the First World War as a fighter.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 for his part in the raids on Belleneglitz and Lehaucort.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.


According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "through heavy snow and bullets fired from the field and machine guns".
He then leapt into the line of fire, displaying "great valor", leaping solo into a field-gun column and leading his battalion forward, shooting down three of the enemy soldiers.

"I know I haven't lived up to my grandfather's example of courage", said Michael Van, now 72, "but it makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Wan, who was also a member of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, presented a wreath after the parade.
Michael Van said he was very proud to play his part in the parade, adding that the support of so many people proves the bravery of a true hero.
The MMA fans who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 had to settle for Peppa Pig.
Imagine, if you stayed up all night to watch the crowd cheering for the ballot 206 and you were denied this important event.
The San Jose-based Bill has 13 fights, including six on the main card, and is shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.

The men who waited until morning to enjoy the fight were utterly disappointed.

"With the government regulation, it was inappropriate to air that content at 6 a.m. so they had to switch to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig", yeah.
The Bellator company president Scott Coker said that in the future, they will try to create a schedule that will include more UK audiences.
"When we think about replay, I think we can solve this problem", said Coker.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we can't fix this until our time on Sunday and their time on Monday.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Trust me, when the coverage changed, there were tons of text messages flying around, not all of them friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and we thought it was a technical glitch.
n't that the case, it was a government issue.
can I promise you that this will never happen again.
We've reduced the six fights to five, as we normally do, and I think we've given the audience more than we need.
"It's an unfortunate situation".

Desert Island Disc is on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
On Saturday, the Ryder Cup, Mickelson was not in top form.
Phil Mickelson of the United States will make history on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get his form up to make sure it's not an unpleasant milestone.


Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old was not exactly accurate with the ball, and he was not suited to the rugged, grassy terrain of the National Golf Course, where he would punish mistakes.
Although the golf course is not as hard as it should be, Mickelson is facing the preeminent British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie star Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their events this week.
If the four-point underdogs get off to a strong start in the 12 singles games, then Mickelson's play will be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not saying he could say anything else.
He fully understood what role he would have to play today and he knocked me out and told me that he would be ready tomorrow,furik said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a great guy, and he's contributed a lot to these teams last week and this week.
i, I don't think I ever imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened.
He wants to go out there, like everybody else.
on Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
a Ryder Cup career that doesn't quite match the heights of his personal record would be over.

He is funny, he is fiercely sarcastic, he is funny, he likes to make people laugh, and he is a great person to be on the team,furik explained.
I think it was fun for the young players to play against him this week.
He's going to provide more than just play.
Europa, Captain Thomas John, knows the big lead is about to go.
Thomas John, the European captain, knows from experience that the unbroken lead in the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup is bound to be crushed.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they came to the finish line by a very slight margin, with a lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2, which they won.
"You're reminding yourself that we have a big lead at Valderama; we had a big lead at Brook Line, where we lost, and we won at Valderama, and it was just a win", said John, commenting on the class session of 2018 when John's team won 5-3 at Le Golf International on Sunday and 10-6 yesterday.
So history has shown me and the rest of my team that this is not over.
You might be bored tomorrow.
Get out of that situation, do the right thing.
Nothing ends until you get points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and that is our focus.
"I always say I'm focused on my team of 12 players, but we know who's on the other side - they're the best players in the world".
John was delighted with his team's performance on the rugged golf course and added: "I could never get ahead of myself on this.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
s a different kind of thing to do.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
That's the message you're gonna send to the players, which is to bring out the best in you tomorrow.
"Just leave your partner, he's gotta go and get the best out of him".
Unlike John, the opposite attitude is shown by opponent Jim Furyk, who asks the players to perform individually rather than as partners, the only exceptions being Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Fury has seen both ends of the great sporting event at the final day of the Angel Marriott, and was part of the team that won at Brookline, losing to Europe's "Miracle at Medina".
On the final day, Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was asked how he had lined up his players, he said, "I remember every detail of it".
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you want to get a quick start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medina.
When the speed goes the other way, there's a lot of pressure in the midfield.
"We've set the lineup accordingly, we've set the style of the players as we see fit, you know, we're trying to pull out some magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with leading the charge, and in the top match he will face Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Ross, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Pulter being the other Europeans coming in the first half of the order.
I went with this group in this order, because I think it's all inclusive in every way John said about his singles choices.
The commissioning of the new German battleship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's newest warship was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace older and Cold War-era warships, but local media report that it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and snowballing costs.
The military spokesperson was quoted as saying that the commissioning of Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg class of warships, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit daily reported.
The Navy was supposed to receive the ship in 2014, but the fate of the Pride project was adversely affected by problems encountered prior to delivery.
To replace the aging Bremen-class battleships, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007.

Another key feature is that long-term maintenance is not required, so it is possible to deploy new warships away from the home ports, for up to two years.

The ill-fated F125s made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to commission the ships and sent them back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time in the history of the Navy that a ship had been taken out of service and returned to the shipbuilder.
Nobody knows anything about the reasons behind the ship being sent back, but German media reports that the ship has several critical "software and hardware defects" and therefore the warship would be of no use if deployed for a combat mission.
Software inadequacies are particularly important as the new Baden-Württemberg class ships are controlled by a crew of 120 men, just half the size of the old Bremen class battleships.

The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Falls" are believed to have been twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the German Car during World War II.

The initial cost was expected to be €2.2 billion, but it is now said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).


Officials said that the problems are being complicated by the decommissioning of old ships and the failure of the Parak to get new ships.
He expressed regret that none of the new Baden-Württemberg class warships have served the Navy.
National Trust, which monitors the secret life of the whales

The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
Inverarewe Gardens, West Rose, UK, will observe the study of common, soprano pipistrelles and brown long-eared dowbenton bats, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the estate to track the activities of the whales throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings will help to determine the frequency of the waves and to determine which species of waves are making the sound.
The project will also include a detailed ecosystem map and report to create a landscape-wide picture of the behavior of the whales.
The results of the survey will reveal which areas of the ecosystem are most important to the whales and how each of the whales species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of ecosystem conservation activities such as grassland creation and best management of rainforests for bats and other related species.
The last century has seen a dramatic decline in the numbers of whales across Scotland and the UK.
The whales are threatened by buildings and development projects that affect their breeding grounds and by habitat destruction.
The threats to the bats include wind turbines, electric light, fly papers, chemical treatments of construction materials, and attacks from pet cats.
Baboons are not really blind.

They use a highly sophisticated eco-location technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.


The organisation has opened Scotland's first and only dedicated whale sanctuary at the Treva Estate in Dumfries, and the sanctuary, known as Galloway, is home to eight of the whale species found in Scotland.
David Thompson, manager of the estate, says that the estate is a model area for the whales.
"Here in Trive there is room for the bats", he said.
"Here are old buildings, lots of big trees and good ecosystem.
"Today, we're going to be doing a lot of research on whales, but there's still a lot of unknowns about whales, so what we're doing here and on other estates is going to help us understand more about what it takes for whales to thrive".
He stresses the importance of inspecting the whales before performing maintenance inside buildings, because accidentally destroying a mother herd could kill 400 females and cubs, and sometimes even wipe out entire whales in the area.

Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, has appealed to the public for help.

Ronaldo denounces abuse story in German magazine, lawyers seek damages from magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the story of the abuse against him was "fake news" and that people were "making a name for themselves" using his name.

Ronaldo allegedly paid the young woman $375,000 to keep the case quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this".
"Its a fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in a live stream.
"They want to be famous for my name.

They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm happy, I'm fine, and with a smile, he added the star.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a defamation lawsuit against Der Spiegel, which according to Reuters is "an unauthorized reporting on privacy concerns".
The star will seek compensation for "moral damages as serious as the violation", his lawyer Christian Shirtz said, adding that "it is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the star's room after meeting at a nightclub, where Ronaldo made a verbal gesture with Mayorga.

Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual relations, but the documents claimed that it was by mutual consent.
Mayorka claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "that retaliatory measures would be intimidating" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she was still denigrating the alleged incident and had resorted to legal action by canceling the settlement.
Ronaldo was preparing to leave Manchester United and join Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and he had joined Italian giants Juventus for a fee of $100 million this summer.

Toyota's Orris and Aventis-built Barnston plant produced 1,50,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnston, said: "If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I think we'll stop production at our factory".

For example, BMW says that the mini plant in Oxford will be closed for a month following Brexit.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the main concerns expressed by car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line operates on a time-of-parts basis, with parts arriving to Toyota from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Toyota's Derbyshire plant said it was impossible to store more inventory than it could for a day, so production would have to stop.
Theresa May's Checkers Plan for the Future of Relations with the EU, "was precisely planned to avoid such checks at the border", said Clarke.
We need an understanding.We want to have a better understanding that not only allows us to enjoy the current success, but also allows us to take advantage of this opportunity, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"We have a highly successful supply chain, and we definitely need to be able to keep it that way","Recalling evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers"."
Toyota did not say how long it would stop production, but warned that in the long run, the extra costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and result in job losses.
Peter Zuvallaris, who has worked at Barnston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned about the fact that once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU, a government spokesperson said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein is delayed again
The White House said Sunday that the ongoing fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will delay Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein by a week.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the president's obstruction of justice.
Washington has been fueling rumors for months whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general and whether Mueller's independence will be compromised.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied this report.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump at the UN in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he was "not interested" in dismissing Rosenstein, but delayed the meeting to avoid it during the Senate Judiciary Committee trial, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who alleged he had been sexually abused, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of Kavanaugh, again delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for that, it's probably this week, and I think it could be postponed another week given everything else at the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I'm always interested in bringing new information to the media".
Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to "crowd-out" by TV reporters, although she stated: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are coming in crowds".
She suggested that media and Trump would be in direct contact thereafter.
"The president is handling more Q&A sessions than any of his predecessors", he said."We've looked at the numbers", he added, without proof.
There will be press conferences, and Sanders said "if the media gets a chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
"We've tried to do this many times, and you've seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and now instead of holding a press conference, you're going to be talking directly to the President of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions during press conferences with dignitaries or when leaving the White House or attending open sessions.
sometimes you don't have a press conference.
This week in New York, we're going to show you why it appeared freely but strangely in front of a crowd of reporters.

Cristiano Abercrombie has been rushed to hospital with a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery for a head injury following a loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, May 31-27, reports Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters he was injured just before halftime.
"He got on the sideline and he got stuck",reed said.
On the sideline, the trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen and placed him in a tracher, and then took him away for further examination.
Abercrombie has completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center, according to an official at Tennessee State, who told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee.
"There is no information available about the severity/type of injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the accident occurred.
This was the first season at Tennessee State since redshirt sophomore Abercrombie moved from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before the end of Saturday's game, and this season, he had a total of 18 tackles.

UK: Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty for property purchases, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under Tory schemes.
This move will neutralize Corb's move to attract young voters.
UK will charge more stamp duty to those who don't pay taxes
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May today announced that foreigners will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK - and that the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move is an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corb's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting the higher income groups.
The stamp duty will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay UK tax, and will support the Government's move to provide housing to the homeless.
Surcharge - In addition to the current stamp duty, imposed on second homes and rental homes two years ago - can be up to 3%.
The Treasury aims to raise up to £120 million in a year.
13%
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" as a good percentage of foreign buyers spend more time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused property prices of rising because large construction firms own land but do not use it and called on Mrs May to drop quotas on affordable housing to address the UK's "housing scandal".
Mr. Corbyn also announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to the eviction of "no-nonsense".
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said:
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.

Jack Ross: "My ultimate desire is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to take over Scotland at some point.
The challenge for the 42-year-old, who is currently third in League One, is to revive the North-East club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
I got a B cap, that's all, Rose told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.

"But I'll only get that chance if I manage the club".
The Sunderland manager was preceded by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Cano.

"Can I bring this club back to the Premier League now?""For me, success will be measured now.

"It's not easy to get it there, but I'm going to see success here if I can get this club back there".
Rose has spent just three years of his managerial career as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa climb from relegation to the third tier, and saved St Mirren from relegation to win the championship title the following season.
Rose also said that he feels happier now than his sports career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It might have been the real turning point", he says, taking over from Lova.
"I honestly believed that management was better for me than playing.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
can be difficult to play
You're gonna have to go through a lot every week.
I still have work-related issues and pressures, but management feels great.
"I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm one. I'm happy to be doing what I love at my best age".

The extreme summer heat has triggered a surge in pubs in the UK, which have suffered losses, with restaurant chains facing increased pressure.
The figures show that in July, sales rose by 2.7 per cent in pub bar groups, while in restaurants it fell by 4.8 per cent.

The restaurant sector experienced a 1.8 per cent decline in June, which was further lower than in July.
When the drink-led pubs and bars were stronger than they'd been in years, the restaurants were going down.
Food-led pubs also suffered from the summer heat, but this was not as much as restaurants.
I think everybody's going out for a drink.
"Sale of drinks in bars and pubs increased by 6.6% in the month, while food decreased by 3%".
"These results from the end of April are still coming", says Paul Neumann, analyst at Lisher and Hospitallity, RSM.
The major factors influencing sales in markets are weather and social sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are concerned, although the 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales is in addition to the continuing price pressure.
Food Lead operators are the ones most affected by the prolonged summer, and we must wait and see if the comparatively mild weather in August will bring temporary relief.
The overall 2.7 percent growth experienced in July with the emergence of new openings in the pub and restaurant sectors actually indicates a slowdown in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and reviews the performance data of 47 working groups with a turnover of £9 billion. It is a benchmark in the field.

20% of the children said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
1 in 5 children - even those as young as 11 years old - have social media accounts and keep them hidden from adults.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news raised concerns that sexual content was being posted.
20% of students say they have a clean "main" account and secret personal accounts to show their parents.

The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40% of children aged 11-18 had 2 profiles, half of which kept secret accounts.
"It's an unfortunate fact that teenagers are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find", said HMC Chief Mike Bucknan.

The breast pump advertisement, which compared mothers to cows, sparked controversy online
The ad comparing nursing mothers to lactating cows has led to various comments online.
To launch a product titled "The World's First Wearable Noise-Free Breast Pump", consumer tech company LV has advertised a fun music video showing the facility that the new pump provides mothers.
The lyrics read: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see the tail" and "If you're not paying attention, I'll tell you, these aren't the nipples, these are my tits".
"Pump, pump, I give it to the kids". "Pump, pump, I give it to the kids".

"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision."
"They carry babies and give birth, just like us, and produce milk, except they take their babies away from them within days of birth", one commentator noted.

I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
This ad is a little bit off, but I'm gonna take it as it is.
"This is a good product", one commented.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad targeting mothers (sometimes in the workplace and in the toilet) who look like "pumping cows".
"It's not praising or criticizing the dairy industry".
The dancing women at the end of the video reveal that they all had pumps inside their bra.
The idea behind this campaign is that women who pump their breasts look like cows.
The LV pump is certainly convenient, with no wires or tubes, and will fit tightly inside the nursing brake, giving women the freedom to walk, pick up children, and get out while pumping.
"The LV pump is a revolutionary product, and it takes a bold, rousing start", says Anna Ballerin, partner of the mother and ECD.
We tried to bring to light the disadvantages of breast pumping by comparing nursing mothers and cows, and to show the freedom of the new pump in a very interesting and relatable way.
This isn't the first time LV pumps have been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, the model, mother of two, did the catwalk for designer Martha Jacobawski with this product.

Many traditional sponsors become undocumented immigrants and risk their own situation if they step forward to take on the responsibility of a child.
The risk was increased in June by a policy calling on federal authorities, sponsors and adult members of their household to submit their fingerprints and share that information with the Immigration Authority.

The agency confirmed that about 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the sponsors and their families are illegal immigrants and a large part of them have a criminal background.
"We were trying to get rid of them", said Mr. Alburns.
To settle the children's case quickly, officials implemented new rules whereby they would have to appear in court within a month of being detained.

The unqualified will be immediately deported.


They said that moving children to tent cities without giving them the time to prepare mentally or even to say goodbye to their friends, only increased their experience.

The US and EU have warned that they will not help Syria rebuild until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has opened the way for further political talks, UN diplomats said.
The Russian-Turkish deal has averted a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in an area where 3 million people live.

The UN Ambassador, Stefan de Mistura, said he hoped to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the ruling party and the opposition to pave the way for the drafting of the post-war Syrian constitution and holding elections.

Lamp is running against Republican Rep. Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which has now been expanded to the 17th district.
The boundaries were redrawn following a January Supreme Court ruling that the old districts had been unconstitutionally misrepresented in favor of the Republican Party.
The New 17s race marked the beginning of a financial feud between the big finance parties, The Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamp has become a household name in Pennsylvania after winning the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District with a small majority.
The seat was held by the Republican Party for over a decade, with President Donald Trump winning from the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a small chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support for China, and later withdrew from it.

The 7.5 magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.

The quake was felt in Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.


Federal attorneys have demanded that the accused in the NYC terror attack be given a rare death sentence.
New York City lawyers are calling for the death penalty for the NYC terrorist attack that killed eight people, the rarest execution ever carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Zypov used a home depot rental truck to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, causing the deaths of pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to the Southern District of New York's notice of cause of death, to justify the death sentence, lawyers would have to prove that Mr. Saipov had killed all eight 'intentionally' and inflicted 'consciously' serious physical injury.
Both charges are punishable by death.
weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipho on 22 counts, including 8 counts of murder in aid of robbery, which federal attorneys use for common organized crime, and charges of assault and destruction of a motor vehicle.

"Saffulo Habibullavić has caused injury and damage to the family and friends of Diego N. Ric Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Her Nan Ferrucci, Her Nan Diego Mendoza and Alajan Drao Damian Pugnuco", says the Notice of Intent.
The five people involved in the accident were Argentineans.
After a decade, the Southern District of New York has sentenced a person to death.
Khalid Barnes, who was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Uzbekistan-born Mr. Saipov has expressed no remorse for the attack, days and months after.
police said he told investigators that he was only happy with his work.
Saipov told authorities that the attack was inspired by ISIS videos on his phone.
police said he asked to raise an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
"Naturally disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty without the possibility of parole for life is going to increase the emotional impact of all those involved", said Pathan.
Saipov's opponent had already requested the lawyers not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MPs want Nigel Faraj to be in charge of Brexit negotiations

The former UKIP leader suggested that politicians should "get hot" from Eurosceptics - one of Theresa May's own MPs had suggested that she be put in charge of consultations with Europe.

The Tories underlined the challenges May faces in uniting her divided ranks by lining up for a special protest against Brexit in the city.
Prime Minister is struggling to protect his Chequers compromise plan from the attacks of the Brexiteers, the Rimeys and the EU.
The allies argued that they would go ahead and make a deal with Brussels regardless of the setbacks they had encountered - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their promise and 'difficulties'.

He suggested that Mr Farage be given equal responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added 'I support Brexit, but we need to get Chequers out'
He stated that he was opposed to the EU, and that we were not subject to world wars.
"We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Bonn has denied claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election. The claim that the British public has changed their minds and wants to stay is completely false.
Andrea Jenkins, a Tory Brexiteer, was also at the march, and she told the press, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not well known in the public eye, the opposition is not going to vote for it, and it is not popular with the activists who have overstepped our party and elected us in the first place.
Please stop playing checkers and start paying attention.
In her message to Miss Maine, she added:

'It's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our ruling class,' he said.
They're trying to cheat Brexit but we're here today to tell them we're not going to let you do that
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: 'I want you to 'feel warm' our political class on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We are mobilizing the People's Army of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become free, sovereign and United Kingdom.
The Remnants marched to Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group started over the weekend, the Tory activists were waving their little wisdom against the Brexit banners.

It was clear from that moment that Valtteri Bottas had qualified for Saturday's match, where Mercedes' team orders played a big part.
Boots had a great start to the pole and defended his position in the first two laps, inviting home team to attack teammates, making Hamilton worse.
The decision to go to Pittsburgh first and let Hamilton drive through the traffic was crucial.
Mercedes was behind home plate after a lap, but Hamilton went ahead after the wheel-to-wheel action, and cut the Ferrari driver who had avoided the risk of holding impatiently after the double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Werstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then held onto the tyres for a quick finish, and he was ahead for much of the race, finishing fourth behind Kimi Raikkonen.
He reached the pits on lap 44 and was unable to accelerate on the remaining eight laps, so Rykon reached 4th.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did so well and he was the gentleman who told me to let go.
"The team did the impossible job of resisting", said Hamilton.
It was definitely rude body language.

"Actually, I'm not sure if they did, but they showed body language that was like they never saw it".
President said that while the Supreme Court nominee was defending himself for sexual assault by three women, the Democrats may be raising their own charges.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You can see their selfishness and bad character, they don't care who they hurt or who they run after to get power and control", the president reported.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates
"If we had what he wanted - a time-bound investigation, a limited investigation - I think we would have brought some unity", said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of "getting caught up" in the biased trail.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican aides want an FBI investigation?

What happens if the FBI reports?
currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which is enough to get Vice President Mike Pence to end the conspiracy and confirm him to the Supreme Court.


Parke Byong-seog, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said that the number of nomads had increased from 2,076 in 2011 to 1,127 last year.
Parke said the main reasons were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher tariffs on smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korea has granted citizenship to most North Korean immigrants in chronological order.
Seoul says that since the Korean War ended in 1953, some 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.

China sees these migrants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to the country.

"I think if a woman spoke like this right now, they would call her 'crazy.'" Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
He was sometimes very emotional, raising his voice and carrying it, when he talked about his family and his high school days.
Kavanaugh blamed the Democrats on the committee for what he called a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also argued that Kavanaugh's testimony proved him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, because she said he was showing anti-democratic attitudes.
"I think the way he made those kind of statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats disqualifies him", she added.
Pelosi expressed disappointment when asked if he would be impeached if Kavanaugh were to secure his seat and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying that if he's not willing to tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court or in his current position", said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about what Kavanaugh's policies will be like against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, especially considering him a conservative legislator.

"This is not the time for a crazy, easily influenced person to go to court and say, 'That would be great,'" said Pelosi.

How does a US-China trade war benefit Beijing?
Pragatbhar said that while the trade war between the US and China is raging and the war is not over, a rift between the two countries would be beneficial for Beijing.

The most important event of the week was the new price information for about $200 million of goods, of which almost half of the total goods coming from China to the US have been taxed.
Beijing has retaliated in the same coin each time, recently raising tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on 60 million US goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the US, and the world's second largest economy is not going to lose its shine anytime soon.
To refuse to sign the Washington Tone is to yield to sanctions, but to publicly yield to the United States is embarrassing to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Pragatbhar said that if Beijing can do things right, US trade war pressures will reduce the interaction between the two economies and things will be in China's favor in the long run.
"If a political decision is actually taken in Washington or Beijing and causes an economic collapse in either country, the consequences could be more dangerous than observers have concluded", said Abigail Grease, a research associate with a special focus on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.

You deserve a compliment.
